[Music] folks up guys mkbhd here okay quick before I start this tour I just want to give a quick shout out to an instagramer named J van B who actually made this quick video and ivory shared it of over 700 Rubik's cubes and then organized them all to make the text mkbhd in my face it's kind of amazing I'll leave a link to it below it's really cool and I've also never actually solved a Rubik's Cube in my entire life like from start to finish so that made that much more impressive for me anyway let's get into the tour hey what's up guys i'm kim Bhd here and welcome to the desk tour set up for early 2020 this is probably the last tour that there's gonna be in this space as we're gonna be moving to a new space in a couple of weeks like I've mentioned so that's really exciting but I figured I'd give you an updated set up tour and it's of the stuff that I use to work and get work done now I already know a lot of the comments on these are already about this cost so much money this is super expensive but just know that this is not my personal setup at home this is my work setup and this is also the culmination of many years more than 10 years now of building a setup like this for work specifically to edit videos that you see here so that's the point of this may be me sharing it you can enjoy it or get ideas for your own setups and things like that either way I think it's a lot of fun so let's just get started [Music] so the best place to start is always the physical desk itself I've talked about this a lot I've had this since college this is a custom sized 8 foot by I think 3 foot next desk air pro it's an incredible piece of thin metal it's a motorized desk so it goes up and down and it happens to be one of the oldest pieces of this setup and it also has some battle scars from me maybe putting things down too hard on it but that's part of the setup is you get some stuff that gets worn in and it gets used a lot speaking of which that's also the chair that I've used this is the Herman Miller embody if you're gonna sit in this chair for many hours at a time which people who edit videos typically do might as well save your back spend a little extra get a share that's really comfortable and supports your spine which these chairs do so these two things have been with me for probably the longest of anything else here so I'll start all the way on the left side of the desk with again one of the oldest pieces which is the studio monitors the speakers these are Yamaha HS eights so it's an 8 inch woofer and a 1 inch tweeter and these things are sitting on top of these auro X acoustic foam pieces if this was just sitting on the desk by itself it would rattle the desk a lot and that's not great for audio at all so they're sitting on these pads which they had been for a while and these are incredible these are internally amplified perfectly balanced studio monitors I have had opportunities to switch to others but these also are really clean looking really good sounding never had any problems with them again I've had these for like six or seven years at least two so I love the Yamaha HSA it's there's also smaller HS 5s and HS 7s then next to that behind this monitor here is what's called the promised Pegasus I've also had this for a while if you've seen the older setup tour videos you'll notice a bit of the theme a lot of this stuff has been here for a bit but that's an 80 terabyte raid array and that's where I backed up all of my videos since like 2013 and then another thing that's special about this desk is it's got built-in power supply right underneath which is like literally bolted to it so I have 12 power outlets there so it's good for cable management and it also lets me have this wireless charger here on my desk and I just plugged in a 1 plus power cable so if I have a wireless charging phone or a wired phone they can both plug in here while I'm not and I have these black air pods Pro from color where I've showed these before in a separate video come on a video call or an interview or a Skype or something like that those are the headphones of choice and then of course is the biggest addition to actually what's on the desk itself which is Apple's Pro display XDR this is the mat nano texture version it works great in here because there's lots of lights all over the place there's natural lighting coming in here so no glare no regrets and these are off both on the pro stand and they're both sitting next to each other in glorious 6k low-key one of the most underrated things about these this is gonna sound like such a complaint but it's true is it's really hard to find high res 6k HDR wallpapers for dual screens so you need like a 12 K setup happening so I've just reversed a wallpaper and put it on both monitors just to make it look kind of nice but that's something I found is tough but that's what's going on here on top of the desk my dual monitor editing setup my dual monitor productivity setup everything about it I'm so glad to have dual monitors again it's been a long time since I've had that iMac Pro for a couple years but I love having two screens now no matter what you think about the Pro stands or whatever you think about the monitors they are actually pretty useful they're plugged into the Mac Pro which I'll get to in a second but they also have a couple USB type-c ports on the back and since these don't have a webcam built-in I have a little magnetic connecting Logitech 4k webcam on top but also since the computers not on the desk anymore like it was with the iMac Pro there's a couple other things plugged into the monitor that aren't plugged into the Mac Pro directly and that is this mini mag reader which it's not as fast when it's going through through the monitor but it works and there's also the dongle to connect to this mouse which I've had problems with it being underneath the desk so when I plugged the dongle in from Logitech MX master 3 into the Mac Pro directly it would have to go through the desk and this mouse would stutter like crazy so I found that putting a dongle behind the monitor and then connecting it to the mouse worked way better so if that's something you're dealing with hopefully that helps also pro tip if you ever need help plugging in something behind the monitor something I've done for a little while is just pop up the selfie camera and go ahead and stick it behind the monitor and then you can see the ports and this is how I've known how exactly to plug in stuff or how many ports I have left fun fact there I did that with the I'm active and then all the way over here on the right is the Apollo twin mark 2 which is actually a little bit more powerful a little more capable although I really don't use it for what it's good for it's a space Greg basically glorified volume button but also has a bunch of plugins and things that people work with audio but basically that's connected to empowering the studio monitors and if I want to plug in headphones that's where I do that too so then last but not least is essentially the control setup which is essentially the Mouse the Magic Trackpad and the keyboard so the mouse like I said MX master 3 it's got a little bit of a custom laser etching on it which is pretty sweet and you had that pro tip of how to make sure it doesn't stutter it also connects by USB type-c it was in a dope tech episode and it's sitting on a red artisan mouse pad this mouse pad I've tried to buy again because you can see it's like getting really worn out but it's I can't find it for sale exactly this one anymore so I feel like my next mousepad is gonna be a slightly different red mouse pad but is what it is it hasn't moved in a long time so I like it and then over here Magic Trackpad - I just use this literally to go back and forth between spaces I have dual monitors but I also often have a lot of stuff going on with Final Cut Pro and then back to the web browser and then my dual screen editing setup so that's why I have the Magic Trackpad and I've often used them both at once that's just sort of the way my setups been for a while and then the keyboard is one of my new favorite little pieces this is the key Tron key cron k2 it's RGB it's wireless it doesn't have the number pad and I don't really miss it I don't use it that much but I found that these brown switches have been my favorites that I've tried in a mechanical keyboard so far and I have a couple custom key caps like the red ascent key up here and I don't know it just feels like at home it's a very unique looking piece it's not as low profile as the Mac keyboard and it sounds really good but yeah that's the keyboard that I've been using for a while it gets really loud when I'm editing but that's my control setup oh and I almost forgot typically had my smart phone or smart phones of choice daily carries whatever you want to call them just straight up on the desk but if there's like some debris or something and you put it facedown then it gets a little dicey so I have the microfiber cloth that came with the protists play xvr just put it right in the middle of the desk phone goes facedown on that when it's not charging doesn't distract me I keep it facedown that's about it for on the desk so that of course brings us to what is underneath the desk which is the new Mac Pro so I've typically not had anything under my desk and I'm working on a full review of this machine this is now the one that I've bought not apples review unit so it is a 28 corer I have right now 768 gigs of ram which is insane they get to Vega Pro to duo it's been excellent so far and I'm editing this video on that I dropped an 8k QA it's been awesome but now my biggest problem problem really is that cables have to get from the Mac Pro up to what's on the desk again and it's a motorized desk gonna moves up and down but while I'm standing now you have two cables to both the monitors and a cable to the Apollo twin mark two and one up to the Pegasus so it's a little bit Messier looking but I'm willing to work with that to have this machine here but they actually make a version of this desk with a little holder for a CPU I think I might end up trying to get one of those and attaching it or something like that but the Mac Pros MS sitting under the desk I've had no airflow problems down here or anything the air goes straight through from left to right so when it's rendering you can stick your hand on the back and feel the hot air but you know no dust really down here or anything I haven't kicked it so it's just been sort of comfortably sitting down there so that's the Mac Pro and how it's contributed to this setup and that review is coming soon and then if I go ahead and slide over here this is how I bring it down to sitting position so that's pretty much it it's pretty simple this is where I've been sitting when editing and making what you've seen for the better part of the last three years or so and we're really excited to be moving into our new space and using everything we've learned from the evolution of this for that but even things like the the sound panels behind here on the wall which have helped with reverb because these speakers are so massive there's foam in the corners that are called base traps there's all sorts of things that we've removed that have been here before but we've ended up with I think a pretty clean simple functional setup I don't know if I'd call it minimal but it's felt pretty clean the whole time so one of my desk doesn't have other stuff on it this is what it looks like also one more thing I forgot to mention the Mac Pro doesn't have an SD card reader built into it right and I guess that makes sense pros don't necessarily need media card readers built in but just for someone that has the Mac Pro underneath their desk that means in order to read SD cards they either have to plug it into the back of the protis play XDR and then somehow plug it in there not ideal or get this thing sticking out the top of a Mac Pro and then plug it in there also not ideal so I have to get one that like sort of cables out onto the desk and looks a little uglier and it's another cable and when I lower the desk it sort of gets extra slack it's a whole weird thing so I've just basically kept this on the desk and plugged it in when I needed it minor detail anyway that's pretty much it for the setup tour 20:20 feels like a short one but I didn't really talk about like other stuff on if you want oh what's on my smartphone video or what's on my daily tech video I've also considered an everyday carry video like a backpack video but if you have a suggestion please leave it in the comments section below because that's where we get our best ideas so anyway that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace
