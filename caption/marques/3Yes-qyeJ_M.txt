[Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and welcome to a quick video about an impressive knockoff of the product that never was air power and also be attempting to set a record for the shortest mkbhd video of this year 2019 so far we'll see how I do okay so I posted a video of this on Twitter not too long ago a couple days ago and it got a lot of interest and a lot of questions so for those who haven't seen it yet this is called err unleashed and the honest truth is there's a ton of other wireless chargers that I'd recommend first before this one because they're either more functional or cheaper but if you're just straight-up trying to get as close to that air power dream as possible so clearly they've taken the approach of trying to create the closest possible thing to what Apple was going to make kind of shamelessly because hey why not so it has this soft touch felt bottom as Apple probably would and a white smooth surface up top you supply your own charging brick to plug it into the non removable cable so you plug it in and you can now charge your iPhone your Apple watch and your wireless charging air pods on the same white oval-shaped pad that looks just like air power okay so natural question why does this exist an air power doesn't well it's a little different from what air power was going to be you can watch my full video I'll link it right below the like button on why air power died and what it was supposed to be but to make a long story short air power was supposed to be this magical mat filled with a ton of overlapping coils so you could drop any compatible Apple device anywhere on the mat and it would just start charging like it was supposed to be really easy kind of like magic but also really tough to make and it ended up presenting a lot of heat issues so this air Unleashed is just three coils very simply so a Qi charging coil on the left-hand side under that plus a Qi charging coil on the right-hand side under the other plus and then it's special proprietary Apple watch charging coil in the indent in the middle with some magnets so it sort of fits in there and lines up every time so the Apple watch of course does not use qi wireless charging so it won't charge on the left or right side only in the middle and of course since it is qi wireless charging you can put whatever compatible device you want doesn't have to be an iphone it could be anything that wirelessly charges but as you can see sort of why this layout it's not perfectly lined up straight across so this left side as you can see has a little bit more space so if you're just ever charging one phone you can pretty much just toss it down somewhere on here and you'll have plenty of room and it lines up pretty well most of the time that's great if you ever want to charge a phone and an Apple watch cool but then once you add a third device that third one has to be a little bit smaller because the coil is pushed over here near the edge and it doesn't have as much room around it basically means you can't quite fit another phone on here without bumping off the Apple watch which means it's perfect for air pods but if you get rid of the Apple watch in the middle then you can charge two normal-sized phones no problem okay so some other questions from when this was posted on Twitter rich asks basically how fast these things will be charging which is a good question because you're basically splitting your charger from one thing to three different things charging at once so I did my own little test I supplied my own wall adapter which was the one plus warped charger but basically any quick charge 2.0 or 3.0 or later brick will work if you have one or if you buy another one it's a couple extra bucks anyway I plugged it in for about twenty minutes with the phone starting at fifty percent and the watch starting at dead so after leaving them there for the full twenty minutes all of them charging at once the phone had gotten up to 56% and the watch had gone from zero to 11% so quick maths that's about five and a half hours of charging the phone from zero to 100 and about three hours to charge the watch so and it'll go a little faster if you only charge one of them at a time but you know that's not fast wireless charging by any means that's totally average and then another question was just does it get really hot or people wondering if mine has caught on fire and I'm I'm happy to report mine has not caught on fire yet it does get a tiny bit warm but the devices that are actually charging usually get more warm than the pad in the first place so I'm actually not worried about here oh that's of course more of a air power reference and then we'll the D brand skin work on the air power knock off so yes D brand did make a joke air power skin for April Fool's Day but no there were never any official dimensions released for air power so that skin was sort of just mocked up to be roughly correct based on the size of the iPhone so I cannot confirm that the skin that D brand made for air power would actually fit this perfectly yes I asked that was a conclusion that we came up with but at the end of the day it's not bad for a knockoff although I guess is it really a knockoff if the product the original product never existed in the first place I don't know still feels like they're copying Apple it's an expensive wireless charger you know comes with the cable built-in but there is no brick in the box you'll have to get one that's separate and we all know air power was gonna be even more expensive but this thing is 99 bucks on their site so like I said there's plenty of other charges for cheaper but for apple vibes this is the one if you live in that ecosystem if you have an iPhone and then Apple watch and wireless charging air pods well then this is all you could Apple have made this if they wanted to if they just realized air power as the concept wasn't gonna work could they have just made this three coil version yeah I think they could have but they were so set on that magic of air power and they don't want to come up short from what they've promised people on stage so they just cancelled it completely so this is the next best thing right how do we do shortest video of the year was that rollable TV video from CES didn't quite hit that mark but hey this was still a fun one hope you enjoyed thank you for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
