what's up guys mkbhd here welcome back to quarantine content just a little entertainment for you while we're all staying inside I'm your host marques Brownlee and this is our first look at a new phone one of the shiniest as you can tell this is the Huawei P 40 Pro now it's hard to think about Huawei phones without reminding ourselves you know no frequent Google Play services updates no Android updates so no matter how good this phone is it's still not likely to be a phone that people like me in this market are going to buy import or even recommend to others but that being said it is still really cool to see a new high-end phone in 2020 the squall weighs showed really cool stuff in the past so the lens through which I'm looking at this phone is what stuff from this phone should other manufacturers copy so that those features end up in more hands around the world that's how I'm looking at this phone so okay first thing to look at with a new phone is the design and this design is one of my favorite things about it now a lot of it is pretty standard for a high-end flagship right now and I'm not talking about that you know we've all seen the rounded square look and the huge camera bump which I'll get to in a second and the metal rails on the side the speaker at the bottom with no headphone jack we've all seen that before but this material though it's not even the ceramic back of the Pro Plus it's just it's got this super soft touch finish on the glass that just feels silky smooth I don't know if the word satin is in this color name but it's pretty great Plus this lighter gray color doesn't show many fingerprints at all and it even refracts light pretty softly so it's not a mirror and it's easy to record this is one of my favorite phone back finishes ever no offence dbrand this is not a phone that should be skinned this should go naked people should feel the back or maybe a clear back case or something like that but yeah this this I hope gets copied and then you've got the screen up front and this one is a mixed bag so it's a six point five eight inch OLED display so not to mass and it's twenty six forty by twelve hundred at ninety Hertz not quite the highest end but viewing angles and and brightness and colors are all high-end and they're nice to look at but what's much more interesting about this screen is the shape so this display not only curves over the edges of the left and right side but it also kind of has a bit of this overflow shape on the top and bottom edges too so always said their goal with this display shape was to make the whole thing look like it's this overflowing screen like the surface of water overflowing from the top of a glass with surface tension and the promo material you've probably seen in this phone has it looking like pretty much all screen but what we've ended up with is this and it's a good-looking screen but it mostly just seems like everything's rounded off and of course the corners don't really get to curve in like that so you end up with this very unique shape that's not necessarily better it's like if you imagine trying to wrap a circular gift with wrapping paper and you try to wrap over the entire sphere without creasing anything like you're gonna end up with some creases in that screen at some point so it's not the worst thing in the world but you can see it is still mostly screen but this isn't something I necessarily copy also you've definitely noticed that huge cut out by now it's for this selfie camera and a depth sensor and infrared this is about as small as you can get actually a pill shaped cutout if you want to still have all three of those things but I think we're finding more and more that the extra depth sensors are not necessarily as useful as we've thought they are but the infrared in the middle is nice to have for face unlock in low-light environments when I see this I think of the iPhone and its massive notch because of course they have all those face ID sensors and I'm hoping maybe finally this year we see a much smaller notch in the new iPhone they seem pretty committed to face ID and keeping the infrared and all that stuff at the top but if we're seeing that while we can do this pill shape cut out being much smaller than a notch then hopefully Apple can shrink the notch this year too then underneath this display is the new optical fingerprint reader which they say is 30% larger 30% faster when I heard that I was like oh thank you sweet on paper those improvements are great I've been saying we should get these fingerprint readers like the whole bottom half of the screen so it's just easy you don't even have to think about it but in practice actually using this one I can't even really tell if it's actually bigger in fact the animation which you can see where it lights up is about the same size as last year and it's fast which is great but really getting that sensor larger is the technical challenge here plus I think this one's actually a little higher up on the phone than I would have wanted but I will still say I hope other manufacturers copy continuing to work on making fitting bigger sensors in these screens so then really probably the biggest focus of this new phone is the camera system on the back what I know it's so subtle did you even notice it back there the p40 Pro has a quad camera system so 50 megapixel main camera with oh is with an absolutely massive one over 1.2 inch sensor then a 40 megapixel ultra wide camera and a 12 megapixel 5x optical periscope camera you can see over there on the side with that recognizable rectangle all on the back with the time-of-flight sensor and a mic and the flash as well interestingly if the galaxy s 20 Ultra didn't exist I think it would be easy to look at this camera and the numbers and think oh wow it looks like while was just playing the numbers game with their camera they're trying to throw as many of the biggest numbers as possible at us to hopefully equal a good camera but Huawei's angle is actually almost the exact opposite of that they said basically we don't think we need to go all out with the numbers we're not hitting a hundred here but we do want to strike a balance between high numbers and actually good performance okay please copy that but of course you can only copy the approach of the camera as far as getting to actual execution now this camera as far as it translates it's still early I've only had this phone for two days for my first impressions but it seems pretty good usually really good I've taken a lot of good photos a lot of sharp photos with this camera it is binning and spitting out 12 megapixel photos by default and for the most part both standard and the ultra-wide are giving me pretty consistent photos although the ultra-wide is still a little bit softer despite it's 40 megapixels but you're also going to notice from the main camera that huge huge sensor has some of the same problems as the huge sensor from the s20 ultra basically with the plane of focus being so thin that close up subjects aren't completely in focus and you do start to get some fringing no autofocus problems though that phase attack autofocus in this phone seems rock-solid despite the problems the s20 ultra had but yeah overall here if you look past the numbers this is a solid camera that reminds me of many Huawei cameras in the past as far as color and high exposure and just a general shot style matter of fact if any of the cameras here impressed me it was actually the selfie camera with all the beauty modes turned off because it kept a ton of detail that to me is a really good first impression the battery in this phone is 4200 milliamp hours and if anything it feels like a bigger battery trend is sort of a way of everyone's hopping on now everyone copying that is a good thing but this one takes it a step further p40 pro has 40 watt wired charging and incredibly support for 40 watt fast wireless charging which is awesome for context the thousand dollar iPhone 11 pro max ships with an 18 watt wired fast charger I don't even know if I have access to a wireless charger that cranks out 40 watts of power but the second I can I will try to get my hands on it but until then other manufacturers yes please copy that and then the rest of the specs of this phone are pretty high-end if you're wondering not bleeding edge but the Karen 998 gigs of ram 128 or 256 gigs of storage ip68 water-resistant 5g enabled and there are a bunch of other little things it does well there's software mui 10.1 while it is better with every iteration it's still nowhere near being able to recommend for this market yes they do have Huawei zap gallery and a lot of other familiar features and UI tweaks like oh I don't know swiping down from the home screen to bring up a search box and app suggestions and a stock weather app that it's not just eerily close but pretty obviously close to another certain weather app and even a new voice assistant they're launching called Celia Celia and you can trigger it by saying hey Celia which I don't want to say they're copying anyone but if you say it fast enough hey Celia so you know I think what you wish but really the software if it was anything amazing or game-changing here that would be the easiest to tell other manufacturers to copy because they copy software all the time seems like while was just already ahead of the game in that department so overall my take is p40 Pro is a nice package and it wouldn't be a bad upgrade for pretty much anyone with a two or three-year-old phone and while it is missing a couple of the absolute highest end bleeding-edge stuff like a que video or a hundred twenty Hertz there is a lot of good stuff in here for the rest of the industry to pick up on and that's a win for all of us alright so to end it big shout out to this video sponsor Nord VPN this one is specifically to help you expand your quarantine
