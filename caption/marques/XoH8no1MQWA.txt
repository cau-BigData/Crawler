[Music] hey what is up guys I'm Kip PhD here and welcome back to dope tech bring it back so previous episodes were all thematic where they'll be based around a group of things with one theme or maybe just one huge piece of dope tech but there's been so many things that have come out in the past year and that are about to come out that are all dope tech but don't necessarily get their own video so this is my way of sort of collecting them in one place I know some other people have their sort of favorite tech of the month or of the season or a quarter or whatever you want to call it this is my version of that this is dope tech it's a video series to showcase the most impressive bleeding-edge super high end or just straight-up awesome tech that makes its way to the studio that doesn't necessarily get its own video it will all be here so this may feel a little rapid-fire but that's what happens this time of year when there's so much impressive stuff coming out so let's get right into it so I'm gonna start with this guy so this is called the Asus Zenbook Pro duo it's pretty wild I'd describe it as a sort of almost dual screen laptop you can probably already see what I mean so it's already a big desktop replacement high-end laptop it has a 15-inch 4k OLED display which right off the bat there's not a whole lot of laptops like that it has an Intel ninth Gen 8 core CPU r-tx 2060 graphics a terabyte SSD 32 gigs of ram and a ton of high-speed iOS you can see no card reader but both full-size USB and USB type-c but the high-end specs aren't why this is dope tech it's of course this crazy form factor so first of all you can see this hinge is pretty unique I like unique hinges this one unfolds the laptop into a sort of a propping it up off of whatever surface you're on and that sort of several functions one it gives you a better typing angle and it's going to need that extra cooling for this massive second screen it has on the bottom half it's like the MacBook Pros touch bar went and eight five or six other touch bars and then went to the gym and just got super huge it's gigantic to the point where it is another 4k IPS display itself it's not full UHD but it is 3840 across by 1,100 tall and it's coated in this anti glare finish so it's matte like apples touch bar to avoid glare from overhead lights and things like that which makes sense since it's at this angle but it also appears a bit dimmer than the main display since you're never really looking directly at it it's always at this sort of off sideways viewing angle and it's also super smooth and soft to the touch it is a touch screen unlike the glossy er top display which is really nice to touch anyway okay so what is the second screen for what does it do so essentially the best thing it does is act as a second display so Windows actually sees it as two different displays but you can do the same thing on both screens if you want which is kind of trippy but the best stuff you'll do with it will come with window management so you can get one Chrome window up at the top while you have Spotify open on the bottom and maybe a Twitter window on the other side and all the window snapping and everything that Windows does will work the same you can snap left or snap right go fullscreen and there's an extra layer of Asus software added to let you do things like switch apps between the screens or pin the launcher or full screen apps across both displays full screening across both displays like I said it's kind of weird looking but it does work I just think this is the least often way that you'll use it unless some apps happen to scale perfectly maybe you can imagine having Adobe's Lightroom up at the top with most of the UI elements where they normally are but just the filmstrip of all your photos at the bottom or maybe Adobe Premiere about the top but just the timeline on the bottom screen the way I find myself using it most often was just using the regular apps and stuff like I normally do at the top and then having something like Spotify or maybe Twitter or something like a files app that I can just sort of mindlessly keep there but I'm not using on the main screen then I sort of have my setup going and I don't know it's kind of great and then asus has a couple of features built in to make this layout and more useful like a dock that you can pin apps to and you can have it remember a play outs with moe to pull apps so you can just hit one button and it loads your whole layouts for all your apps again I'm into it I think it could be worth it now the question for someone considering buying this laptop right now is is it worth moving the keyboard all the way down to the bottom edge and crunching the trackpad from this widescreen laptop all the way over the corner and this little postage stamp-sized I don't know I guess most of the time you're using something like this you'll have a mouse with you and bonus the heating vents there cooling vents on the side will actually heat your hand with the mouse fun fact but I just figured people will find like the perfect use case for something like this to work out in their workflow like a game or playing a game up at the top and having a twitch stream live chat and discord on the bottom screen just certain things are gonna work perfectly with this top and bottom screen setup that are gonna make it worth the compromise of that tiny trackpad laptops of the future might be similar to this or they might get rid of the keyboard entirely for some people it'll just be one giant screen with a folding display in the middle that just folds shut like a clamshell we're not there yet and they call this a laptop of the future and I think for a lot of people it is but if you want to get this right now you can it starts at less than 3000 bucks so I'll have a link to everything I talked about in this video in the description okay next up is another dual screen thing kinda it's the LGV 50 and it's dual screen case now the phone by itself wouldn't have made dope tech gonna be perfectly honest it's a pretty under-the-radar phone but it has 5g now and it still does have that quad DAC in the headphone jack but otherwise a pretty standard issue smart phone for a thousand bucks but what they do have is a fascinating implementation for doubling your pixels on a smart phone and you guys know I'm a kind of a sucker for pixels so I guess they basically said screw it since we can't make a folding phone right now what we can do is put some pins on the back of an existing phone and then make a case that takes those pins and has a display in it and turns it into a dual screen phone so you pop it into this case you hit the dual screen button and now you have a dual screen phone now still I don't know how much I had to use something like this it's no doubt drawing extra power from the phone it'll make your battery life a bit less but honestly the way it works it works surprisingly well like it's much smoother than I expected so you can go ahead and open different things on each screen and on the dual screen feature lets you swap what's on each screen put one of the screens to sleep etc they've really thought this through it's not as automatic as an actual folding phone but that's of course not really what this is you can even go sideways with it you can watch a full screen video on one screen while you text or tweet or do whatever you want on the other kind of looks like a Nintendo DS when it's sideways like this it's an interesting concept and then it folds over completely backwards if you want it to which deactivates the back screen so now if you just want to use the phone normally and leave it in this case you can do that folding phones I guess can't really do that but I just love how much they've thought this through and it does one thing I think better than any folding phone does in my opinion which is just like that the springs that the weight of that build quality it's built well I don't know I just think this is just so interestingly well considered that the cutout up here for the earpiece to pass through if you make a phone call with it the fact that you can flip it over completely it's funny it brings me back to you know to brings me back to when HTC made that dot matrix case for the HTC One m8 back in a day that was one of the I think that is actually the first video I ever shot on a red camera fun fact okay so next up are these guys right here so these are Sony's new wireless noise cancelling earbuds they're called the W F 1000 X m3 the name is still terrible but they are absolutely worth your consideration I think they're my new favorite wireless earbuds right now so with these new totally wireless earbuds there's a couple different types of earbuds wearers but I think I've sort of picked up on one would be the power beats Pro type of user where you're getting them specifically to work out to sweatin them run around shake your head a lot that type of thing and the other is like the air pods happy you where you're just having the convenience of no wires taking some phone calls listening to music pretty chill and these fall somewhere in between I reviewed Sony's over ear headphones not too long ago and they turn into my favorite headphones to fly with period so now that I've experienced those I wouldn't necessarily buy these to fly with but they do an impressive job at a lot of things for ear buds so first of all they're comfortable which is like priority number one for me for ear buds when they sit in your ear is that they're comfortable and these are and they just sit in your ear just like this they have touch controls over physical buttons which takes a little bit of getting used to but I actually prefer that on ear buds so you don't have to be pressing them into your ear just to press one of the buttons and there's a lot of stuff you can do with it in the Sony app like remapping controls from the right earbud to the left ear bud they're very customizable and they have autoplay pause so when you take it out of your ear whatever music playing stops and I love that a lot of these are doing them now with the proximity sensor in the earbud and it's quick it stops pretty much as soon as you take it out and plays as soon as you put it back in and they also have multiple device connectivity which is funny because the headphone versions of these that I reviewed not that long ago didn't have that these do and overall I'm gonna say that they are the best sounding wireless earbuds that I've heard that I've tried so far they're on par with or better than the jaybird runs great mids not really shrill highs and pretty solid bass and again in the Sony app you can change the frequency response if you like it to be bass here the noise cancellation element is kind of minor just because you're getting most of your noise isolation from the passive seal created by the ear buds anyway but they do a little extra work with the microphones to quiet those constant background noises so if you're in a car or on a train or a plane or something like that these are nice the case to these isn't too bad you know somewhere between air pods and power beats pocketable but just barely but a quick charges the buds which is nice and it's matte black so I guess I have to like it and it does instant pairing with this NFC just by touching it to the back of your phone that's tight the one downside the big downside really is that these are not water resistant so if you want to work out in these you'd still want to get something like the power beats so you can actually sweating them and they'd stay in your ears better but even that not a whole lot of bad things to say about it we're also expecting possibly noise canceling air pods to be a thing pretty soon actually we may see that by the end of 2019 so if you're waiting and sort of holding your breath for better air pods that might be interesting to you but if you're not one of those people these are definitely a pair that you should check out they're a hundred percent worth your consideration okay sony rx100 mark 7 i just wanted to bring this up for one specific reason so there are a lot of really great in-depth videos on the new RX 100's on youtube i'll link those below this obviously isn't that but i've been an RX 100 fans since literally the very first one it's been an awesome compact photo camera and then it stepped up its game as a 4k video camera over the past couple years articulating LCD screen better color science eye tracking autofocus and it's always been such a great compact form factor and it's so very modular it's got a pop-up OLED EVF it has a pop-up flash it has the custom ring that you can map to whatever you want but it's always been missing one thing I'm Mike Jack and this version mark 7 finally has a mic Jack honestly it seems like every time Canon releases something Sony is always ready with something right up their sleeve like waiting to be released it seems like this is another one of those things it sort of came in the middle of a cycle they had done it on the year pretty regularly for a while until this one but they finally threw a mic jack in the rx100 mark 7 which I think makes it that much better of a little point shoot vlogging camera definitely worth checking out the competition back and forth between Canon and Sony over the years has actually been really fascinating to watch it almost seems like Canon enjoy shooting himself in the foot and leaving out individual features that would make a camera amazing Sony does not have a habit of doing that at this point all right I don't know if you saw it over here before but it was in a previous shot this is the newest member of the Logitech MX family it's the Logitech MX master 3 so it just came out but Logitech has let me use this guy for the past week and I gotta say I like it a lot in appearance it is a pretty minor up from the MX master 2s it looks pretty similar but it has some minor adjustments the battery indicator for example is higher up so you can see it even when your hand is on the mouse the forward and back buttons are a bit more separate so they're easier to press without looking and the sort of a hex design is now these more clear ridges and clean and a couple other really subtle things the main difference is the scroll wheel is now much improved and the software is super customizable so now you can map the same buttons for different functions in different apps so for example the sideways scroll wheel for me and final cut that will scroll left and right on the timeline but in Photoshop it'll change the brush size and in the browser it'll just scroll left and right and of course the one main thing that I was sort of hoping that they would do all along actually with the last MX master is they've switched over to USB type-c and for no other reason and the fact that I can use a bunch of my existing cables now that's really satisfying so I've really enjoyed using this editing with this mouse using it everyday it's one of the few pieces of tech that I can say I've consistently had the same product or version of the product in my workflow for a very long time so the best mouse that I've used for the past couple years just got better gotta love that continuity alright so last but not least is the microphone that I'm speaking into right now this is not even new it's just new to me and I newly love it it's the shure sm7b so you've probably heard of this guy already if you're in the podcasting world but i've been doing video for so long and I've been using a shotgun microphone specifically by Sennheiser for so long then now that I'm doing podcasts and that I'm in this audio world I'm discovering this whole new world of audio gear so this mic this one specifically might be the most popular went out there it's the one Joe Rogan uses it's the one a ton of radio stations have used probably ASMR videos it's out there it is made specifically for vocals both in the way it's tuned for frequency response and what noises it isolates and in the way it's built it's solid metal it's rugged just about everything about it one pro tip I can give besides getting it on armed and getting the microphone as close to your mouth as possible for the best sound is to get some sort of external amplification like this this is a cloud lifter if you haven't already heard of it it's often sold with the shure sm7b which happens to be a very quiet microphone by itself if you go straight into a recorder which is what we tried first on episode one of our podcast but we found these we got them they do a great job of amplifying and now the microphone sounds much more lively and more open it just sounds better so you plug the microphone via XLR into the cloud lifter you plug the cloud lifter into your recorder and to get the amplification that way and it's great so I just figured I'd give a shout out to the mic which is a central piece of the podcast and give a shout out to the podcast while we're at it but either way that has been it that is episode one of dope tech and I'm super open to your suggestions for both format and all sorts of other ways that we can make these episodes better I think there are a lot of fun but I think we're gonna have a lot of other stuff to show you so other ways that we can do it well are welcome in the comments section below but again like I said all the links of all the things I talked about are also below and that'll be it thank you for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
