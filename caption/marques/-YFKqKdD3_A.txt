[Music] hey what's up guys ANCA Bhd here and my favorite tech of the year for 2019 was that the Lao optics probe lens it's of course an incredibly fun and unique lens you don't see anything like it usually but it enabled many of the shots you just saw in that little montage and of course has made fun many shots you've seen during videos during the course of the year it's made shooting tech a lot more fun but of course it's a $1500 super specialty lens it didn't even come out this year I just sort of discovered it this year so instead of that sort of useless bit of information I figured why not get together some of my favorite creators and have us all share our favorite tech of the Year 2019 whether we discovered it this year or it came out this year stuff that made our year better in text that's exactly what we did so sit back relax and enjoy some of our favorite creators talking about their favorite tech of this year hey I'm Dave and my favorite piece of tech from 2019 is a device that was notorious for getting really hot this is the not a flamethrower and let me tell you why I like it I've always loved fire I mean who doesn't this is the greatest stuff ever and to package it into this controllable portable device greatest piece of tech 2019 you've probably seen my laser iPhone back glass repair video lasers are really what's interesting to me this year yeah all of the new cell phones are really good and all the new headphones are really good but when everything is really good it's hard to pick a favorite so that's why I was taking with lasers I found this pretty interesting little piece of tech while I was working on my team trees workbench it can very accurately using a laser measure distance up to 65 feet with an eighth of an inch accuracy there are two little openings up at the top of the box one is for emitting the laser and the other is for reading how long it takes for the laser to bounce off of whatever it's shooting at the little sensor can tell by the reflection how far away an object is it's pretty instantaneous it does cost about twice as much as a normal tape measure but when you're measuring lots of things it might be worth it lasers my favourite tech of 2019 would be the iPhone 11 Pro primarily because of this wide angle lens I actually use my iPhone a lot to shoot run-and-gun simple b-roll shots for my videos just because it's so convenient so having access to that new lens for cool slow-mo shots like this just makes me really happy my favorite piece of tech for 2019 not an easy question iPod air pod where they called air pod Pro or up there are up there also the iPhone 11 is one of my favorite iPhones ever but my favorite piece of tech my favorite piece of tech is definitely the folding phone not necessarily the Samsung fold and not necessarily the razor hole which I've got one of right here but folding phone technology for me is my favorite most exciting piece of technology to go into consumers hands in 2019 it doesn't matter how much top tech I pack on my back all of it is worthless if I can't keep it charged on the road so mister Mobile's MVP is a battery pack but stay with me it's a cool one this is the Sherpa 100 PD by gold 0 the 100 means it's the biggest battery you can bring onto an airplane and the PD is for power delivery at sixty watts that means it can charge my laptop on the go and the cheap plate up top means it can charge a phone at the same time it's not cheap and it's not small but it is the best battery pack I've used it's my top choice for anyone who needs to stay charged while staying mobile my favorite piece of tech from this year has to be the Asus Zenbook pro duo with an i-9 r-tx 2060 32 gigs of ram it enables me to travel with a laptop that is similar to desktop speed because well we can't all travel with an imac pro marques but yan the foreign factor 2 displays i mean somebody to displace hey what's going on marques this is sean evans host of hot ones and i want to take a second to shout out my favourite piece of technology of the year these right here the bose 700 noise cancelling headphones now when you travel as much as we do popping up our budget set all over the place you need something that'll help you black out the noise especially on airplanes and ever since I got these I have not heard a baby crying or like the pilot getting on the horn telling us to put on our seat belts haven't had an update in a year and it's all thanks to these bose noise-canceling 700 headphones emphasis on the noise cancelling my favorite piece of tech that i've discovered this year is my Nintendo switch because it's completely changed how I feel about traveling now I'm like hey I have an 11 hour flight and before it was obviously our flight hi everyone canoopsy here my favorite tech of the year is surprising it's the new 10.2 inch budget iPad it's a great deal and even more so on sale has Apple pencil smart keyboard and iPad OS support now I love the iPad pro and it's kind of my main computer at this point and the 10.2 inch iPad is basically a budget version of that tablet it really is amazing and let's even more people try that fantastic new iPad OS experience I'm gonna go with the obvious because I'm a photographer that's pretty much all that I do I take photos for a living the fact that I can take photos with the iPhone 11 Pro Max and post them to my portfolio and people can't really distinguish if they were taken with a smartphone or a mirrorless or DSLR camera that to me is a significant leap forward in technology that is awesome so having something in my pocket that I use every single day that I travel with that's always right there that can rival you know most case photography cameras that that's sick my favorite tech from this year would have to be the iPhone because I bought a lot of them and gave them away also it'd be really funny if you put what I'm about to say at the end of the video put this next part at the end of the video hey you probably need a little break from all that Apple stuff right don't worry I got you my favorite tech in 2019 is this the samsung q 900 are a KTB and don't let the AKA height fool you because there's really not a lot of a.k content right now so that's not the reason that I'm hooked on this TV the reason why is the active aka upscaling so 1080p upscale looks sharper than most 4k TVs and 4k upscale is just incredible so every time that I watch movies are content on any other TV and go back to this one I notice immediately it's noticeably sharper and brighter hey everybody I am dieter from the verge I'm out near Saint Cloud Minnesota visiting my family for Thanksgiving it is freaking cold but I want to tell you my favorite gadget was and it's a this thing right here the Apple watch series 5 and it's not that I love the always-on screen that's that I got the cellular version because this is the year that I got locked into iMessage so I could talk to my family but sometimes I just want carry one phone I don't wanna have both of the hundred phone and an iPhone and this thing lets me do it I can just carry an Android phone around so there you go it's cold what's up guys super safe here my favorite piece of tech of 2019 it's gonna be the samsung galaxy fault now I know I know it's not perfect it's super fragile it's super expensive and it's got a super small front display but I've not been this excited about any smartphone in a very long time and in my opinion this is the biggest innovation that we've seen in the smartphone space in a very long time as well the fact that I can have a tablet sized display which I can simply fold and put in my pocket is amazing and it gets me super pumped about the future of foldable devices marques thank you so much for having me my favorite piece of tech is probably the the DJI Osmo pocket really fantastic quality and it's it's almost stupid proof which makes it perfect for me Linus from Linus tech tips here and I chose AMD's Rison third gen series of CPUs they're great for gaming which I love of course but the real reason I chose them is that they're ideal for anyone who wants to do more than just gaming with their PC like creating YouTube videos with the rise in 3600 we built a 4k capable video editing workstation for under a thousand bucks that just wasn't feasible even a few short years ago also honorable mention to LG's OLED TVs with g-sync variable refresh rate support it has been a great year for smartphones the iPhones are the best they've been in years however what I'm really excited about this year is the oneplus 70 at this kind of price it is honestly one of my favorite Android phones I have ever used full stop and a big part of that is the screen it is so smooth so responsive everything is so all optimized it's a slightly better camera away from being an absolutely killer phone as it is it's just really really good no not you iPhone 11 awkward not you either air pods Pro don't make this weird no I'm gonna zag instead of Apple zig and go with the oculus quest I know what you're thinking with all the controversies the only thing worse than Facebook in your browser just has got to be facebook on your well face but if we separate the technical achievement from the company for just a moment this is the first full-on fully independent we are set up no gaming PC no room sensors just you a headset a set of controllers in Star Wars thanks Marquez what's up guys aaron here from the mysteries the boss channel and my pick is the samsung galaxy fold on one hand and I fully mean this it is a mind-numbing ly annoying phone to use the front screen is just too small to do even a lot of casual tasks and the big screen is too square most apps they're designed for normal tall smartphone displays so with the folds you'll be constantly finding applications that are either cut off on the top and the bottom or ones that only take advantage of 50% of your screen but I don't think I've ever been this glad that a tech product exists it's really promising start to the flexible future what's going on guys - travis consumer and my favorite tech of 2019 has to be the asus zenbook pro duo asus came out with something completely different and i'd really like the step that they took with the additional screen at the bottom now you do get that keyboard that's a little bit lower but it is a nice feeling keyboard typing on it is a really good experience you do have that interesting trackpad on the side which also doubles as a numbered pad and there are just a lot of cool things here 4k screen oled a graphics card so you could do some gaming asus knock this one out of the park and made me look at laptops differently for this year alright so that is it a few of your favorite creators and their favorite pieces of tech for the year big shout out to everyone who participated and sent in their clips and I'll have a link below to everyone who had their favorite piece
