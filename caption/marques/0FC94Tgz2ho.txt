[Music] what's up guys FQ PhD here welcome back to dopes Tech the series where we take a look at the most impressive most amazing most incredible tech that's out there brought to you by the dope Tec shirt of course and so in this quarantine edition of dope Tec we've got some tech that's around the studio right now that is still really crazy impressive sometimes to do like a montage version sometimes the whole episode is about one thing there's some stuff around the studio to show let's get into it okay item number one is this table that I've been talking about on Twitter and Instagram and showing so this is called the Sisyphus table Sisyphus table there's a bunch of different styles and and types and versions of this but we should know is Sisyphus is the figure from Greek mythology who is condemned to rolling a huge boulder up a mountain for eternity on this table that Boulder is this steel marble rolling through the sand and Sisyphus is a rotating magnet position by a Wi-Fi connected robot arm I've been super into this table for no other reason than just how cool it looks when it's doing its thing and how I guess easily distracted I can be by a little more bellowing around but it's it's really cool fundamentally it's just a regular table on top with this thin layer of silica sand that comes with the table itself you literally just pour it in and spread it out and set it up then underneath is the tech itself which is a computer that's rotating this arm around with a magnet on it that controls where that ball goes and it's a pretty fine-tuned control as you can see to the point where you know these overlapping lines can create these thin lines and really precise shapes and designs you can add more or less sand to for a different look and there's an LED ring around the table that makes this dramatic evenly lit look that I'm super into then on top of all that there's an app there's a Sisyphus app that lets you control everything so there are whole playlists of user-generated patterns and images that you can have it draw some are simple and some are much more complex and you can even attempt to make your own in the app itself but it is super hard let me tell you to make anything that looks as good as the stuff that's already there so I stick with the pre-made ones it also does this really satisfying erasing sequence after every new piece of art I could wash it all day literally which is I guess why I put it in a different room but really that's what made a dope tech for me it's it's technically internet-connected it has an app it is tech but really it's moving art it's it's mesmerizing watching the ball go around in circles and draw these new designs erase everything then draw something new erase it again and just continue perpetually forever just like the myth itself all right next item up is this guy right here this is the matte black phantom reactor it's a wireless speaker it's pretty compact you can see is plug into the wall and it's most impressive for how small it is versus how incredibly loud it actually gets so this version of the phantom is it's maybe the size of an iPad Mini it's like eight inches long 6 inches wide and it weighs 4.3 kilograms or about 10 pounds it's like a bowling ball so it's a super compact design and it's also pretty simple so besides being matte black it's nice and clean it's the smaller full range driver on the front and then these two side pieces are the woofers that really move air and then on the back you have these fins that are literally a heat sink and the whole idea is the cabinet is so compact and so dense that it produces the super loud sound from how much air it moves and it moves a lot of air when it's playing you know at high volumes get this massive punchy rich bass from these big drivers and how much air they they push from all that small cabinet space it's already connected to Spotify let me play a quick demo from Jordan Edmunds half volume [Music] so I got two of them but when you get two of the exact same model you can pair them together as a stereo pair so there's one over here one on the other side of the studio and they're a left-right stereo pair and when you connect to it and Spotify it sees it as one speaker and appropriately splits it and then you get that sweet loud stereo image it actually does have a little bit of computer on the inside for the record every speaker does but this one of course has Internet connected features too so it has an ARM processor and half a gig of ram and you know your Wi-Fi chip that's all it needs and yeah this speaker is a it's a tiny portable noise complaint is what it is it gets so crazy loud at high volume and has surprisingly little distortion at those high volumes not surprisingly is a pretty bass heavy sound overall there isn't really a midsize driver to focus on the mids so I can kind of feel like a V shaped EQ but honestly for what I'm using it for filling up a room somewhere or just outdoor space it's not a huge deal and I know in the title that says it's a $3500 speaker there's actually a couple different versions of it there's a six hundred and a nine hundred watt version this is the the 900 watt compact version but then there's a bigger phantom that's 2,000 watts and then four thousand five hundred watts so you're over a hundred decibels peak at that point which is nuts but that high-end version costs about four thousand dollars so you know this is a little safer than that I guess all I'm really saying is it's worth the noise complaint it's really impressive okay this next one in dope tech is for my fellow video nerds out there you'll know who you are if I say Helios 44 - - and your ears perk up a little bit that's where we're going with this one so in order to understand why this is dope tech you have to understand what's so special about the original Helios 44 - - so this is my Helios 44 - two lens it obviously doesn't look quite like the rest of the lenses in the collection and that's because it's a vintage used Russian lens you can grab on Amazon or Ebay for about 60 bucks I've had it for a while and it's known for its swirly bokeh and really fun optical characteristics see most modern lenses especially in the cinema world are very clinical rectilinear super high on maximizing sharpness minimizing distortion and giving you the most accurate look possible and generally that's good but sometimes you just want a more fun look to play with so you might have recognized this swirly background in various mkbhd videos in the past and these have all come from this one little vintage helios lens it is a 58 millimeter lens and it's not particularly sharp and it's also so old that it's really not very well built or easy to use but it gets the job done and the look is fun so this as you might have guessed is what's called a rehoused lens a rehoused version of this and it's it's pretty common in the industry to rehouse various lenses for certain reasons but for this one it makes perfect sense so it's still as optically fun and unique as the Helios because it's the same glass but it's in a barrel that gives it much better build quality a much longer life and a much longer focused throw to make it easier to focus on things it gives it gears for a follow focus if you want to use that it gives it threads four filters if you want to add those and just overall a more satisfying confident feel this one's made by a company called iron glass it's linked below and it's awesome so to those wondering where the swirly background shots come from now you know fun fact did you know that one terabyte SD cards are just out there in the world now along with one terabyte micro SD cards as well this is three and fifty bucks so it is pretty expensive for an SD card but it's also not insane for a terabyte and the grand scheme of terabytes you can buy anyway I feel a little nervous putting that much data on a card you could just snap in half but I'll link this below along with all the rest of this stuff from this episode in case you're feeling dangerous but anyway there you have it an insane Bluetooth speaker a magnetic table vintage rehoused lenses it's another episode of dope Tech in the books thank you for watching and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace
