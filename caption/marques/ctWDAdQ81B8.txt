[Music] it was up guys mkbhd here and this is the new 16 inch macbook pro this this right here and I'm here to tell you this is in fact the best laptop that Apple has ever made it's not the one I would personally get but it's gonna be great for a lot of people so the 15 inch macbook pro that this replaces was their previous highest and best laptop and it was pretty good in some ways but it had problems real problems it had thermal overheating problems that I've talked about in my video and it had keyboard problems so this new version of their highest end Pro laptop is better in every way and fixes specifically those problems it's kind of like Apple hire to listen to the people team that's just going through their lineup one by one during the year and fixing them based on what people have said about them the iPad pro how people wanted functional USB type-c give the people what they want air pods Pro oh you wanted better sound and a better fit in the ear and noise cancellation give the people what they want iPhone 11 Pro oh ultra white is in you wanted a bigger battery with the thicker iPhone give the people what they want so now here they are they've derived on the MacBook Pro so they fixed the keyboard and made it better they made the laptop slightly thicker and gave it a bigger battery they fix the thermal performance issues and they gave it a bigger screen with thinner bezels wherever this imaginary team is at Apple good looks you did almost everything right here so for the most part the design is still the same but as you may have heard the new 16 inch is slightly bigger in every dimension than the 15-inch MacBook Pro it still fits in most of the same backpacks and sleeves for me it still is fine in my peak design everyday 20 liters which is a smaller one so it's not exactly the same footprint but it's very close only difference I really noticed was the slightly higher weight it's around 4.3 pounds now instead of 4 but for what you get out of this slightly bigger chassis I'll absolutely take it if we start at the keyboard it's no mechanical keyboard or anything but it's this new version which has switched back to the scissor switches and it's a significantly better typing experience than those old butterfly keys there's actually some real millimeter key travel now they should be more durable and they're just generally better to type on which for me comes from the fact that the keys are a bit more stable so you're back to getting more confident key presses even when you're not necessarily pressing in the center of the key so yeah for me someone who never really cared that much about the keyboard and with the new butterfly switch I just kind of got used to it I didn't really expect to care this much about the keyboard but now that I've been typing on it I do it is much better oh and they also changes the layout a bit as you may have noticed dedicated Escape key is now separate from the touch bar thankfully which that touch bar still seems to freeze all the time for me and the touch ID sensor the power button is also now separated on the right hand side not as big of a deal still works great for unlocking and then you also now have the inverted T layout for the arrow keys which people seem really pumped about but I honestly didn't mind the bigger sideways arrow keys at all they're actually easier for me to hit but whatever I'm not a complete touch typist and then the slight extra thickness gives it a bit more room for a larger battery in fact the largest legally allowed battery for domestic flights in the u.s. a hundred watt hours and the battery life has been excellent especially when you're not pushing it I had a five hour flight where I basically the whole time was using airplane Wi-Fi for email light web browsing and writing parts of this video and landed at about 60% which is nuts of course your mileage may vary you know if you're editing in Final Cut Pro yes the battery life is still going to be trash or if you're doing anything heavy like that but of course you might as well just plug in if you're doing something like that so I do appreciate a thicker laptop for that all-day battery peace of mind also the new brick the new brick it comes with is a 96 watts and I know probably shouldn't do this but this is what tends to become like my Universal charge everything fast charger for USB type C so the laptop my iPad pro my phone my Sony wireless headphones they all charge via a USB type-c it's like the universal fast charger that just works with everything right so the specs of this laptop here we have the Intel Core I 9 we have 64 gigs of ram we have these new graphics cards and 4 terabytes of storage here there's also an option to go up to 8 terabytes of storage now which is honestly incredible and it's not even that overpriced so while it is expensive having it be only 2200 bucks for 8 terabytes and essentially never having to use an external drive again is actually kind of reasonable for people considering buying one of these I'd say the order of upgrades should probably always be GPU first the new graphics are excellent and then I'd go upgrade the RAM and you can go up to 64 but it starts at already 16 gigs and then CPU now you may be saying wait this is the same overheating I 9 CPU as the last model and you'd be right this is the same CPU but now because this laptop is a little bit thicker and in a bit of a larger footprint the heatsink is a bit bigger and the fan blades are a little bit larger and they have some room to rearrange components inside in a way that landed at 28 percent better thermal efficiency and basically that's allowed the MacBook Pro to stay at higher clock speeds from much longer durations without throttling down and if I'm being candid it also just seems like it's less afraid to just spin up the fans quickly whenever it needs them and just be loud sometimes so the difference is you'll notice improvements under sustained loads so for things like rendering a large project compiling code exporting a video a lot of things like that that people do on MacBook Pros so to bring that into daily performance it is markedly better than the performance I got from the 15-inch MacBook Pro for those types of loads and I still refuse to throw read raw footage at my laptop and I'll explain why in a second but basically I threw a ESR 4k footage at it for the Tesla cyber truck event and a handle back just fine part of this is from better GPU optimization in Final Cut in catallena from other video professionals reviewing this machine things like Premiere and DaVinci Resolve see some much more modest improvements like five to ten percent at best but an improvement is an improvement and better optimization will keep this thing getting better over time so why don't I just headed everything on the MacBook Pro well you might know I still shoot everything in red raw not pro res and these are my render times for a five-minute unedited clip just to transcode an export before I even upload it and of course you know these videos are a little longer than five minutes they're usually closer to ten multiple Clips color correction graphics whatever else so it sort of scales up from that so uh yeah it doesn't really make sense I still need a desktop that's why I travel with an iMac pro when I shoot red I do this to myself so ok they fixed the keyboard they fixed the thermal profile performance is better they maxed out the battery and on top of all of that they've improved the built-in microphone with a much better signal-to-noise ratio so you listening to right now it's really good for a laptop webcam not gonna deny that I wouldn't say it's studio quality but it's definitely very good it's just a shame they paired it again with this Charmin soft 720p webcam or it could have been a pretty sweet little video setup anyway the speakers are also improved - holy crap level they are incredible I've never heard speakers in any other laptop this good and this loud now I don't know what that means if you're gonna you know not carry a Bluetooth speaker anymore if or if you can just fill a room with music or listen to videos really loud whatever it is it's gonna be great at for me the use case was when I was in LA I forgot the wire for my headphones so when editing that cyber truck video I just used the built-in speakers and this thing was the real deal even over the previous excellent macbook pro speakers the main difference really is the new forced canceling woofers which you'll notice offer more bass and just generally a more impressive high volume sound so to the listen to the people committee over at Apple a round of applause well done but while I have your attention there's a couple other things that I think if you want to listen to the people that you could really do to take this laptop to the next level the port's first of all I know you're not gonna bring back full-size USB but since it's a full size laptop maybe one or two other USB type-c ports give us six instead of four and then SD cards I know this is something you don't want to bring back but as far as people I know that use a MacBook Pro or just creative professionals I know pretty much 100% of them use SD cards even I shoot - these little SSDs in this camera but for audio SD card and I know the argument would typically be just plug in whatever accessory you have I a USB type-c but having that SD card reader for just universal memory reading would be just just bring that back and then teehee I feel like this is more of a nice-to-have but having LTE or a cellular option would make it feel like more of a complete mobile workstation and be able to work on the train and more in between places that don't have Wi-Fi I do that a lot with the iPad pro I would love to have that on a macbook pro and then while I'm at it I wish there was a black option maybe even matte black like the surface laptop this space gray here honestly looks just kind of like a slightly darker silver maybe it's just me whatever you can always get more into it and dbrand it to make it whatever color you want I do brand like every laptop I use but the inside being black would have been cool too and then take everything every improvement you just made with this 16 inch MacBook Pro and do it to the 13 inch MacBook Pro because as long as that 13 inch laptop is sitting there with those bigger bezels with that older keyboard and with that not so great thermal design it's gonna be really hard to keep recommending it even though that's the size of laptop that I'm more likely to want so wrap that all up in the 13-inch make it a 14 inch macbook pro and that would be pretty sweet there's rumours Apple may do this around the next gen that Intel 10th gen and that would be fantastic but we'll just have to see but yeah in the meantime overall this is the best laptop they've ever made as it should be and I hope this imaginary committee at Apple that I just made up and I hope actually exists keeps doing their thing across the rest of the Apple lineup also speaking of doing your thing only a couple days left less than a week to get in on this drop of mkbhd merch if you want to get it for the holidays or if you know someone who wants to get it for the holidays and this is your time to get in you know what to do link is below until the next one thank you very much for watching catch you later peace
