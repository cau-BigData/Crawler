[Music] hey what is up guys and kabhi HD here and this is finally the pixel for the most leaked phone in history probably is finally revealed and I feel personally attacked so the title of this video is Google and gaps so the pixel 4 we already kind of knew almost everything about it but now that it's actually out it's been on stage and the details have all sort of been filled in it's kind of what we expected it's a very Google phone Android 10 and the Google assistant and some new features and all that but also there's some head-scratching gaps some things missing with this phone let's get into it so the designs similar to other pixels is definitely the tameness part of this new phone it's not a flashy design at all to the point where it's kind of funny it's got this big forehead it's bigger than the chin it doesn't have the thinnest bezels it has a flat display which I actually like and there's three colors black white and orange I like they're still doing the colored power buttons so the Panda one has I'm calling a panda the Panda one has an orange power button and the orange one here has this sort of pink power button that's okay I wish it was white and they all have a matte black metal rail around the whole phone around the top the sides the speakers at the bottom and the USB type-c port matte black all the way around everything and it's a nice weight of the whole phone and I really like the soft touch matte finish on the backs seems like 2019 has really become the year of matte black finishes except except for the fact that the black phone is the only one that's not matte finish so this orange one is matte on the back the white one matte on the back and the all-black phone which could have been mapped like everything is glossy for some reason so I don't know I feel slighted but you can see what I mean it's a pretty simple design flat display instead of curved over the edges a solid pair of speakers with the second one being up in the earpiece at the top and on the back you of course have your camera square bump the infamous design trend of 2019 but it isn't triple cameras up here it's dual cameras a flash and laser autofocus so it's one stage camera and one telephoto a 2x telephoto so they didn't include an ultra wide camera on the pixel 4 and I don't know I was kind of waiting this is something we've been waiting for for a long time to see finally multiple cameras and a pixel they've always done the best they could with software with one camera but the one thing you can't fake with software he's an ultra wide so now that every other phone in this class has an ultra wide I was pumped to see it I was excited to see what they could do with an ultra wide camera on the pixel and then I didn't do it that's a bummer I feel like it's actually a bigger deal that they didn't include it then if they had just put it in anyway so you have a standard camera and the 2x telephoto and this will be better for some things like portrait mode which now only works with the telephoto you can't take wide portrait photos anymore and the rest of everything else with the normal camera should still be fine I mean this is one of those things I got a test of course for the full review to see if it's actually better than the legendary pixel 3 or if there are instances where maybe just night mode is better or if astrophotography or those things they show it on stage with the Stars and the moon at night look better but so far from what I've seen it looks to be another great smartphone camera you can follow me on Twitter if you want to see the sample photos I post and of course that will make its way into the full review but yeah so far so good so while wide-angle can be fun we think telephoto is more important [Applause] [Music] yeah I definitely feel personally attacked alright so why does the pixel four have such a big forehead it's bigger than the chin it's like notable I guess it's better than the bathtub notch but what's the big deal here pixel four now has an entire suite of front-facing sensors up at the top including infrared and radar which is new and smart phones to do what they call the fastest facial recognition unlocking in any smartphone and they're so confident in it in fact that they've gotten rid of any other biometric authentication which means no fingerprint reader anywhere else on this phone not under the glass not on the back just face unlock so this all falls under motion sense parts of it seem pretty cool other parts of it a little rough so when motion sense is on it uses the radar to sense when you're coming near the phone to pick it up and then it preps the cameras and the sensors to read your face and unlock it immediately as you're picking the phone up so I tried it out at the event I put my face data in with the new UI for that and gave it a shot and it worked pretty well I pick up the phone from a flat surface and it was on and unlocked by the time I even got it up to my face and I didn't even have to press the power button so that is pretty cool I don't really think anything about the actual reading of your face is anything crazy proprietary it's still infrared it still works at a decent amount of angles but it's using that radar to sense when you're coming and picking up the phone and turning it on early that's the cool part and then they use radar also to do a couple of other gesture base things and these are much more hit or miss I actually like the one where you have a timer or an alarm clock going off and when it starts beeping as you reach for the phone the radar sees your hand coming and quiets down the alarm and that's pretty cool then you can swipe it away and it silences it now I got the alarm quieting down as I reach for the phone to work every single time flawlessly but the whole swipe away thing that didn't always work for me every time and this was a theme in general with the whole swiping thing it's hard to get it right which you know could be rough in the morning if you're trying not to hit things on your desk as you swipe your nightstand over and over but it's also supposed to work for accepting or denying a call and moving forward or backward in media and this was way harder to get it to work than it should be when you're in a place where a swipe over the phone is supported you see this glowing happening at the top and the notification bar and you can see and move to the left or right when it works and it recognizes your hand movement but I honestly think I got it to work like 10% of the times that I actually tried to swipe it there is no real feedback about what I was doing wrong or how I could do it better so this seems like something I'm probably never going to use you might remember LG did this too on their last flagship with infrared but I got to give them credit because they actually had a little visual on the screen of at least how to do the weird hand gesture better like get closer get further up top there's no such indicator on the pixel so it's frustratingly difficult anyway my favorite feature about the pixel 4 without a doubt easy because the 90 Hertz display love that my first impression is it looks great it's nice and smooth as you'd expect from a high refresh rate display and it's a high resolution to its 3200 by 1800 s so my first impressions of this OLED are it's pretty color accurate sharp but not very bright I definitely struggled outdoors to get bright enough but it that's going to be its weakness we'll learn more about this as I use the phone more for the review and then the rest of the specs Snapdragon a 55 not a 55 plus I think you're looking at 6 SIG's of RAM starting at 128 gigs of storage and 2800 or 3700 milliamp hour battery I think that smaller battery might be something to keep an eye on for the pixel for especially with that 90 heard screen but the bigger one which I'm testing the XL 3,700 million powers seems fine it will find out as I test the phone but yeah that's something to keep an eye on and then it's Android 10 so mostly what we've seen in Android 10 is the same as previous betas on other phones there's the new face unlock UI like I mentioned along with some camera app improvements and improvement to Google Assistant that speeds it up even more and lets you use it hands-free more often and there's also now a pretty sweet built-in voice memo app that's actually impressive it now transcribes everything you say in real time on the device and records it all in text as well so you can see it marking down all your words as you speak and then you can go back into search and use the text to search for each word you say and it'll show we're in the voice memo you said that word so that's pretty impressive now if I was a big voice memos guy I'd be super into that so look a lot of this stuff it's better it's not drastically impressive like nothing really wowed me and maybe that's because everything leaked like we saw everything I was gonna be coming so it's impossible to get surprised by the event but yeah it's felt like there are some serious gaps to like okay the no matte black version of the phone okay I get it you want to mix it up have a little glossy fingerprint 'back with the matte black okay and then the specs are better and you have extra RAM but no snapdragon 855 plus it's kind of sort of this weird time of year where phones are starting to come out now with the snapdragon 855 plus and this phone for more money doesn't have it so it's kind of tough and then the lack of the ultra-wide was really that's tough like I was so looking forward to having like what could they do with an ultra wide pixel camera how good could it be and that we don't have that and it seems like Google might not even really care super much about that either there's no 2x button in the camera app it's just kind of there I thought it would be mandatory if you adopt this whole square thing like you have to have triple cameras we'll see I don't know for $7.99 I think the pixel for the smaller one that's gonna be a tough sell because that's a hundred bucks more than the iPhone 11 and well that's just a regular pixel for but for the XL that starts at 899 I think that'll be more compelling interesting Buy and that's the one I'm testing so that's one two stay tuned for the full review of but let me know what else you want to see in the comment section below if you have any concerns battery-life maybe the cameras maybe there's video quality things you definitely want to see in the review let me know but no matter what you do make sure you subscribe to be the first to see that when it comes out tech Tober rolls on lots of stuff happening there's been your first impression is the pixel for thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one bass
