[Music] I took a hit so you don't have to [Music] okay sup guys m'kay Bhd here so for those of you following a saga last year a whole bunch of hype started building for this phone called the Escobar phone which turned out just to be a royal flex pay folding phone with a gold colored paint job that was clearly BS people ordered the phone and never got it then flashed forward a couple months later there was another one the Escobar fold - and I did a video about it at this point which was sort of going over the whole idea that okay this now is another phone we've already seen it's the Samsung Galaxy fold with a gold coloured sticker on it and again the people that order that phone they lost their money and they never got it so then fast forward again to a couple days ago and I have an email in my inbox from the Escobar guys says our latest phone is scheduled to deliver to you tomorrow we are doing a big launch and there's a DHL tracking number but like well I already made a video about how you guys are scamming people and how you shouldn't give them any of your money and how you should direct your attention to other things why would you willingly send me another package but then again it is from the chief of assassinations maybe maybe I shouldn't open this but I did I opened it for you guys of course here's what I found they're basically doing the same thing yet again but this time a little more shameless than before this one they're calling the Escobar gold 11 Pro maybe you've seen the headlines by now so I don't know maybe I missed the Escobar Gold 10 and the Escobar gold 9 or whatever but right at the top of the box is a very familiar looking phone because it's an iPhone 11 Pro with some gold on it there was never any confusion right like they we never thought that the Escobar company was making any sort of phone every single one of these so far has been someone else's phone with some gold wrapped around it and stamping their logo it just so we're on the same page now this one they're saying they plated in 24 karat solid gold and you know what honestly this appears to be true this whole sticker thing was too easy to peel off and notice apparently maybe my last video sort of gave it away so now you have this phone where apparently there's some protective clear coating on top that was easy for me to peel off and then it is the actual back of the iPhone but plated in a thin layer of something metallic that appears to be gold now I don't have my jerry-rigged everything Mo's picked but gold is a soft metal scratches at a level 2 with deeper grooves at a level 3 so while it's clearly not a sticker on the back of the phone here I am able to actually scratch some of this metal off it appears to just be flecks of gold from my knife if you look into it it's actually not that expensive to coat something this size in a thin layer of gold the escobar's even say so on this site something around like 50 bucks but anyway underneath the phone in the box is this piece of paper here labeled condition report which I'll get to in a second and then the accessories and that's it but see I don't want to spend any more time on the product because I feel like the more time we spend on this gold phone the more we lose sight of the bigger picture here they're not gonna ship you this just like they didn't ship the fold one or the fold two if you give them your money you won't be getting this either it's just marketing see if we take a step back every company if you want to call it that has a structure in place and has a plan and the components around it designed to make them money as much money as they possibly can and so this is another one of those businesses where you know they've rinsed and repeated this formula enough times that we can see what their strategy is and if this is the first time we're ever wrong about it it's too late because this is the face they've painted for themselves step one pick a desirable tech product and put it on your website for a remarkably cheap so whether it's a two thousand dollar folding phone or a thousand dollar iPhone doesn't really matter as long as the price you list is way below what you'd expect step 2 hype it up and make up some sort of a story behind it and they do this a lot this is where you see all the wild videos on their various YouTube channels and the unboxings with the escobar girls etc etc buying r.i.p apple.com and having it redirect to the site you know they're painting this whole image for themselves along with the escobar name they even made this one limited edition to just two thousand units in a story they're pushing this time is that their refurbished iphones that they're buying and fixing up with genuine apple parts and then coating them in gold and shipping them even comes with this condition report like i mentioned earlier that lists the parts of the phone that were good and the parts of the phone that were replaced fun fact a rune from mister who's the boss we've been talking about this he also got one of these and we compared our condition reports for our phones say different things isn't actually convincing it is very possible that these are actually refurbished iphones now do I believe that Escobar Inc is the ones refurbishing it not really and also none of it matters because they're not actually shipping it step3 marketing this is the part where they send it to influencers to youtubers to just get it in front of cameras get the press wave going obviously didn't order this phone now the key is to only ship out a few of those to the people who you believe will make the videos and will share it with their audiences and things like that but as long as that number of phones is small and you ship them to the right people those videos will generate more sales that you never have to ship and then as a bonus since all press is good press how about a little lawsuit with Apple you may have noticed a weird looking paper at the top of the box in the unboxing it's this dear buyer sheet and a 14 page printout of a lawsuit apparently filed by the US District Court of Nevada for some reason I'll spare you all the details of actually reading all this because I did it for you basically this one is a 14 page lawsuit about them suing one of their former employees for like stealing a couple thousand bucks from them and the YouTube channel I kind of believe that and then this other one here this dear buyer sheet includes a note about them suing Apple for 2.6 billion dollars and this is apparently because the the head of assassinations was was using FaceTime and there was a bug in FaceTime that allowed someone to find his location and so that caused him a lot of distress and that person was trying to kill him and so he had to sue Apple for all the distress and all the money he spent relocating and beefing up his security as you can tell I don't know if you're getting a picture here but that's not worth 2 billion dollars but for whatever reason the media just loves reporting on this they can't help themselves anyone suing Apple is already kind of big clicks nice juicy headline but for 2 billion dollars and the Escobar's how exciting but honestly this might be the smartest thing they've ever done smarter than just sending the phone to youtubers because you know what they don't expect to win this lawsuit you don't expect do you really expect Apple to settle for 2 billion dollars to this random company no well you know what they do expect press coverage and you know what else these sites are putting in their articles about this lawsuit or IP Apple calm the Escobar gold iPhone their brand new campaign the limited edition it's free real estate step 4 take people's money no refunds basically once they've used all of this press to get people to their site finally and they've riled people up with the Escobar name and their crazy videos and the limited edition counter then you'll notice if you actually add this thing to your cart and proceed to checkout the only payment methods for this phone are a direct bank transfer cryptocurrency or a Western Union direct bank transfer this should be just about the biggest red flag ever they're hoping you don't think too hard about it though you know it's the Escobar's they got their whole crypto thing going on I don't know but the whole point is these are all non-refundable payment methods and so as they take your money and then dodge you for a week some couple weeks a couple months a couple of years if they have to you will never get your money back because these are non-refundable payment methods definitely check out mr. who's the boss he's droppin a video at the same time as this where he goes a little more into the the company itself the Escobar Inc people what they're up to and why they actually ship books to people instead of phones the facts are kind of interesting there but to answer my question back at the beginning of the video why did they send me this package in this phone if I've already made a video tearing them down talking about how their phone is a scam and the honest answer as dumb as it sounds is they've probably done the math and realized that this is still good press for them when I put up my last video a couple hours later it looked like their site went down and we felt like oh we can celebrate we actually sort of took them down but no it was really kind of just a hug of death when too many people goes to a site and takes down the server because they can't handle that much traffic the site went back up and maybe at least five or six of you actually tried to give them money to get a phone from seeing my video about it so let me be perfectly clear in this video if I haven't already gotten the point across do not give them your money unless you never want to see it again and never get anything back for it but there there are much better uses of just giving away money give to charity give it to a better cause right now and don't pay any attention to this Escobar Inc company as long as they keep rinsing and repeating the same strategy it's not worth paying attention to there you have it but if you do get super curious and just want to visit their site I do advise protecting yourself with the sponsor of this video expressvpn so some of you like to check the apps on my phone in every video and if you have then you're one of the people who's noticed expressvpn on my phone so it's kind of perfect that they're sponsoring this video because they're all about internet security and privacy and of course I've tried other Reap Ian's in the past but if you've listened to wave form you know this is the one I've been using for a while because the fastest one I've tried and because they take their stuff very seriously so you've all been spending a lot more time on the internet lately me too and when we do we start to realise this process could be better one example is when you're browsing the internet from the comfort of your own home your internet service provider whether that's Verizon or Comcast or whoever they can see every single site that you visit and that's whether you're in incognito mode or you clear your browsing history or whatever they can see all that and they are legally allowed to take that information and sell it to advertisers to other companies for profits so with expressvpn they rewrite your connection through secure encrypted servers so your ISP not see what websites you're visiting even if it is Escobar ENCOM and the cherry on top is you can change your region to pretty much whatever region you want whatever country you want so think of all the different libraries on all these different networks you just unlocked on whether it's Netflix or Hulu or BBC for that matter I've recently been watching billions it's not available at all on the US Netflix but if I switch my location to Japan refresh the page I can watch all the newest stuff when it comes out so unlock hundreds of new shows and content and protect your privacy online with expressvpn make sure you visit the link below or go to
