[Music] hey what is up guys I'm Kabaddi here and these are the new air pods Pro could you tell the difference yeah alright good cuz I I wouldn't want you thinking I had like the old air pods or something alright so apples quietly drop the new air pods on their site yesterday and I've been using them for about a day now from when this videos going live so these are some first impressions and they're honestly pretty nice now these cost two hundred and fifty dollars like that's pretty high-end so at this point they can't sound like crap anymore they're actually competing with some other really nice headphones at this price or even nice earbuds at this price so what's so pro about these new air pods Pro well I'll tell you everything that's new first of all the new design so you can see them here they're a little bit smaller and they have a shorter stem and they kind of look like that one pokemon or maybe a hairdryer or maybe even pingu man the internet is fast to meme these new Apple products but I honestly don't think they look about the head they're a little less toothbrush II more reasonable looking more compact we've seen how weird these types of headphones can get with stuff like the Microsoft Surface buds I think this is an improvement actually which they came in more colors and that actually was one of the rumors that there might be a black pair and as hard as they would be to find if you lost them I still would have liked to have seen that but you still have glossy white now again for your in ear headphones but they are now officially ipx4 rated for water resistance so that's good for you know it's sweat resistant basically good for a light rain if you're wearing them you want to go outside you shouldn't have to worry i PX for and there's of course the rubber tips now so in the unboxing you'll see they come with three different size rubber tips total the mediums are attached out the box and they have a smaller pair and a bigger pair and actually do a little Apple magic with that that I'll show you in a second and they of course still have the h1 chip so they'll pair by just being near your iPhone and opening the case and then you get this little tutorial on how to use these new air pods Pro and with this tutorial as you can see it talks you through media controls reading you your messages out loud with Siri and iOS 13.2 and noise cancellation and that's because that's right ear pods Pro do you have active noise cancellation and this is a rumour that I was sort of on the fence about if they would do it or not they did it so this isn't just the passive noise isolation that comes with any pair of earbuds that make it sealing your ear this uses the microphones and the earbuds themselves to do active additional noise cancellation in earbuds and this is just my first impression so far but the noise cancellation is pretty decent I'd say it's about on par if you get a good seal with the beats solo Pro that I've been testing which are on your headphones I mean they're honestly better than I expected from any sort of earbuds I don't use many noise cancelling earbuds not sure I 5 wear them on a plane they're not that good but hey maybe some testing will change my mind in time for when I do the full review the earbuds themselves as you've seen have this larger black grille on the sides and that's where air to pass through so even when you're wearing them with the in-ear seal you can still hear sounds and you don't feel like you're all clogged up when you normally wear earbuds because of that air pass through so that's pretty cool and you can still hear sounds around you and that's thanks to transparency mode so you can turn on the noise cancellation a bunch of different ways you can flip it on in the quick settings in iOS 13.2 with that volume or you can squeeze the stem which is now pressure sensitive for about a second and it'll activate noise cancellation or you can even activate it from your watch if you want to either way you'll hear a chime and it kicks in and it's this pretty good noise cancellation without that vacuum feeling thanks to the air pass through there's even built into iOS this little thing does the magic I talked about called the ear tip fit test and you can open it and run through it it'll play a short sound into your ear and use the microphones inside air pods Pro to determine if you have a good fit or not a good seal if you don't it'll tell you either one or both of them you need to adjust the size of the rubber tips you have on for a better seal and then you can get them right I haven't seen that anywhere before and it seems to work really well and again this isn't the full review but as far as sound quality they sound fine you know these are new drivers and with the noise cancellation on they sound better and without the noise cancellation they sound ok you know I'm gonna give much more detailed feedback for the full review and I'll compare them to other ear buds and things in the price range but for now not bad oh and of course you can't forget last but not least the new case the case itself is actually a little bigger a little bit wider mostly than the previous ear pods case but nothing too drastic it's almost like you turn the old one sideways and stretch that a little bit but it still has wireless charging like Gen 2 still very pocketable and still gives you that quick charging and 24 hours of total battery life and it's also still lightning not that I expected USB type-c for every Apple pro product but yeah still lightning but that is pretty much everything that's new with the brand new air pods Pro why are they called the pro I don't know it's just kind of like everything that's high-end is just called pro now whether it's USB C or higher fresh rate or multiple colors or not I know for a fact there's no audio engineer is waiting to use air pause Pro and their studios but those are the new features and so far seems like a pretty complete package but I think in theory this solves what what my biggest problem was with the previous air pods which is they didn't sound great but they also fell out of my ear instantly this is about how much you'd stick in a normal pair of air pods right so that's like five yards of running so in theory these new ones solve that problem for me by having this little rubber tip they're not gonna fall out of my ear as easily and they're gonna sound better and that's definitely good to see but let me know are you into these are you into this I mean this weird silent announcement they did with air pods Pro they're on the site now they're available today or tomorrow I believe you can get them in stores October 30th and they look a little different but same vibe same idea just more expensive and some more features the cancellation is actually pretty impressive definitely stay tuned for the full review for sound quality and all of my thoughts and let me know if you have any questions or
