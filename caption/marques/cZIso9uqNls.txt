[Music] hey what's up guys and could be if see here so okay you may have seen on Twitter over the past couple months a bit of a series unfolding for those of you who don't follow there which is should by the way but if you don't this is the background so I think the gal gadot story is probably the most recognizable or familiar of them all so gal gadot you already know probably an actress Wonder Woman super popular I'm sure a very nice person she has a Twitter unless the celebrities are on Twitter obviously in this day and age part of her Twitter is that she is a huawei brand ambassador so you know she'll have tweets about how much she loves her Huawei phone well as you may know Twitter has always kept the data about what client or what device you use to tweet from you used to need like a third-party app to show that data but now it just shows up in the regular Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android apps so it's public so one day I'm in an uber and I notice gal gadot is constantly tweeting from an iPhone and not only that she's tweeting those ads those sponsored Huawei posts from an iPhone so I don't know just like the image of her tweeting about how much she loves her while we mate 10 Pro but from an iPhone I thought that was pretty hilarious so I screenshotted it I tweeted that and it blew up there were articles I started getting written about it a legit made headlines I guess it was a slow news day that day people from Huawei ended up reaching out to me about it emailing me how did you find this is this real could this be a mistake but it was a real screenshot and eventually a gal gadot or whoever was running her Twitter account at that time blocks me alright so this whole thing goes by then a couple days later people start sending me links to her tweets saying hey look she's tweeting the same stuff but from Android sure enough I go back and I'm unblocked and I can see all the tweets again and all those twitter for iPhone tweets are gone and are all placed by the same ads but via Twitter for Android well done now I get it these celebrities or at least most of them don't tweet themselves that when you get to a certain level you have a team of people that run your social channels and you know those people can use whatever phones I want but I don't know there's something funny about an ad for a phone being shared via a directly competing phone I don't know maybe I'm just immature but that's still hilarious to me so I thought that would be it for a while but very shortly after it started to pick up again and we've seen this before but it started to seem to happen with a little more frequency so Indian actress Anushka Sharma she's a Google ambassador she's always tweeting about how much she loves her pixel she's been seen in public carrying a pixel phone and she tweeted her latest was an ad for a shot on pixel tweeted via Twitter for iPhone and a little later a real verified Samsung account tweeted an official announcement for the Galaxy Note 9 when that phone came out from an iPhone and then razor razor is official announcement tweet for the razor phone to when the embargo dropped and that phone first was revealed to the public on their account that was tweeted from an iPhone and there was another Samsung account another regional account tweeting an official ad for a Samsung phone of I had twitter for iPhone then the official Huawei Twitter account probably one of Apple's biggest competitors in Asia tweeted a Happy New Year post but via Twitter for iPhone so at this point all these are just blowing up because every single time it's like how hard is it to just avoid using an iPhone for your ad for your Android phone you could use literally any Android phone and it would say Twitter for Android but these people still getting caught using iPhone there was even an article about whoever posted that Huawei New Year's Post from an iPhone they deleted it and then reposted it from an Android phone but whoever posted it got like their their pay docked and that their position was demoted or something weird like that there was real articles about that Wow so at this point toward police are basically in full effect people basically sending me these left and right and I know people have been asking hey do you have like a team of people dedicated just defining these oopsies no it's just a lot of you guys have a penchant for sending them as soon as you notice them but there's all kinds of others caryl pay CEO of oneplus has tweeted from an iPad Linus a fellow youtuber he tweeted his video all about why Android is better than iPhone from an iPhone there was even one instance of Apple tweeting from an Android this was a bit of a stretch it's not like it was an ad for an iPhone or anything but it was an official account from apple the Apple music account replying to some tweet by ariana grande but it came from an Android phone I guess it's just hard to imagine someone who works at Apple and runs their social accounts choosing to do it from an Android phone kind of weird but like I just I I can't jump on all these posts anymore I can't be full enforcement police on every single little infraction you know how many times somebody who's supposed to be a product ambassador for one thing tweets from another thing I can't be on all that Steph Curry for example he's been multiple times in ads for the palm phone he's an ambassador for that he tweets constantly from an iPhone I'm not gonna call him out every single time there's no point anymore like there are hundreds of examples of people who don't have social team's who really do get paid to act like they use one thing and then days later go back to using their iPhone I don't have time for all that the Twitter police must maintain its integrity we got a stick to people who are who are sharing ads for one product directly from the competing product those those are still gold so that's that's basically the summary of the whole Twitter police thing by the way this is not a new phenomenon this is something that's been happening for ages and ages one of my favorites an old classic near and dear to my heart is a long time ago Oprah you know noted influencer was was caught tweeting an ad for a Microsoft Surface tablet from an iPad not even another iPhone from a directly competing tablet I thought that was amazing but one of my favorite things to come out of this someone has actually built a tool that allows you to scrub through Twitter accounts I'll link it below just cuz someone shared it to me you can scrub through Twitter accounts to see not only like the dates of tweets and hashtags used but the client that that person on their Twitter account has been sharing from the whole history of their account so as you can imagine I've sort of taken the liberty to go back through some of the Twitter accounts of note and check them out one thing of note gal gadot has tweeted and has left aha Plus tweets from an iPhone on her account but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and maybe they came from pre Huawei sponsorship days so my favorite thing I found out from this that Samsung mobile nigeria account when i originally called them out with that one tweet from an iphone turns out they had 300 plus tweets from an iphone on that official samsung account no one really cared but i called them out shortly after they deleted or suspended the entire account then a couple hours later it reappeared and when you submit that account in for scrubbing again there are now zero tweets from an iphone from that account so they went back and deleted all of those tweets which is actually really impressive you didn't see anything right so what have we learned from all this aha that celebrity endorsements shouldn't mean much not that they already meant a whole lot but the original point of the mechanics of a celebrity endorsement are hey look people want to be more like this celebrity will pay him or her to say that they use something that way other people will buy that thing so they'll feel closer to that celebrity like they're doing what that person does but celebrities don't really care so the people managing their accounts they'll take money to say they use something but they don't really use it and in the world of tech it's just too easy to get caught bottom line it should be so easy so easy to avoid this but until then people are gonna keep doing it it can't hide from the Twitter police that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace by the way if you ever catch me tweeting an ad for an Android from an iPhone I give you full rein to reach out and slap me through the internet but it'll never happen because it's just too easy to not do
