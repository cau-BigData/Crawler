[Music] hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and this is the iPhone 11 so it's a solid improvement over the iPhone 10 are in a couple ways it's a bit cheaper than the pros now it's got a price drop so this is the new iPhone that most people should buy that was easy to easy actually that this everything about this phone is so easy like it's gonna be super easy to review because there's so few things but such obvious things that are different from the 10r and of course this is a super easy phone for Apple to make and so this is a super easy phone to recommend maybe this is the easiest video I've ever had to make but probably not let's just get into it so the design is very familiar with this one because it's the same as the 10 R and the 10s and the 10 same shape same notch same size as the 10 R it's still a pretty big phone the same mute switch same speakers same aluminum rails the same lightning port same LCD display with the 1792 by 8:28 resolution that has us all questioning a lot of things like not being able to watch HD YouTube videos on a $700 phone but hey people oven reviewers didn't seem to mind a lot last year same water resistance same ip68 same buttons you get the idea so okay what is new first of all the name so they're calling it just iPhone 11 so it's the de-facto standard name now and that also means they're dropping the Roman numerals which is also probably fine because we all know a couple people that just called it the ex over and over that's okay and the iPhone 11 has six new colors so black green yellow purple red and white and they're all more pastel II so at the product red this year is a little lighter than the product red from last year I personally liked the color choices of last year's 10 are more actually I think the blue is pretty nice the coral was really unique but those are all gone now but I guess there's still a little bit of something for everyone if you are looking to get a little closer to that stealth midnight green look but don't want to spend the money on the 11pro you could always grab a darker skin from our channel sponsor debrand and boom you got yourself a stealthy new iphone for $715 instead of a thousand i will of course always drop a link right below that like button but if you rock your phone naked like me you will notice there are two different glass finishes on the back of the iPhone 11 there's glossy like normal across the back where the Apple logo is now in the middle instead of slightly north of the middle but the camera square is actually a matte glass finish now so the opposite of the 11pro which did a matte phone and a glossy camera square and you might already known that but what you might not know is that they're all cut from one piece of glass that's milled down to cut the shape out of it and then two different finishes so that's pretty cool no matter what you think of the shape and then we'll get to of course these cameras in a second but the size and the thickness and weight are exactly the same as the 10r so it's still 8.3 millimeters thick still 194 grams according to Apple site but you do now have a battery life that according to Apple is one hour longer than the iPhone 10 are now again I don't measure battery the same way Apple does but the iPhone 10 are already had some of the best battery life in any iPhone in a really long time and it was the reason that a lot of people who got it kept it and switched to it so I can confirm that the 11 has at least equivalent battery life to the 10r as it should now that it has a more efficient a 13 Bionic so then the only other thing that's new is the cameras and this is easily the biggest new thing about these so there's a new main camera and they'd added a second camera to the iPhone 11 and it's the ultra wide so you now get dual cameras and all the awesome features that come with it like switching between lenses while recording video so you get 4k video from the regular and from the ultra wide camera iPhone 11 dose portrait mode now with more than just human faces so it doesn't have to detect a face to do the fake shallow depth of field with animals and objects and other things like that and there's also a new wider front-facing camera that can take slow slow motion videos it can take it slow motion selfie videos if you want to huh so the only thing that's missing is you don't get the third telephoto camera from the iPhone 11 pro that's not a huge deal to me and both of these two new included cameras are excellent they're a plus smartphone cameras in 2019 I do go into more detail on the photo and video quality in the iPhone 11 Pro review for these new cameras so if you want to check that out I'll link it below but suffice to say this is the best camera in a $700 smartphone debatably arguably the best in any smartphone but I still think it's sort of a toss-up with the pixel 3 but then again this has the ultra wide camera that the pixel 3 doesn't but also the pixel 4 depending on when you watch this is right around the corner so we get to the full camera comparison when they all come out but for now if you want a great camera this is a great camera and then they changed the price they dropped the price so iPhone 11 now starts that and this is for 64 gigs and I think most people or a lot of people should upgrade from that but it starts at 700 bucks now which sort of fits nicely in this gradient of iPhone prices that Apple has created now that they've kept around the 10r from last year for cheaper and the iPhone 8 for even cheaper and that is pretty much everything you need to know that's new with this iPhone 11 easy iPhone 11 is an iPhone 10 are with a slightly new design new cameras with an extra camera on the back a slightly better battery and a new chip as it now the question is do you recommend it and I think the easy answer is yeah this is the iPhone that most people should get but for a little more nuance I think you should really ask yourself two questions one how much do you really care about the quality of this screen the biggest weakness of this phone is definitely still the display and again a lot of people won't even notice and the YouTube app I noticed even lies to you and lets you pick 1080p as if you're watching a 1080p video but you're not it's like I said just over 720p so if you look at the iPhone 10 hour display or if you look at this iPhone 11 in a store and you can tell it's not sharp or you really value a great display and you know it I'd say pick one of the pie resolution OLED I phones the 10s or the 11 Pro and then the other number two is just the size how do you feel about the size of this phone I actually really liked that the iPhone 11 pro is a relatively compact smart phone by today standards anyway so if you look at like the 6.1 inch screen size and it's actually too big if you've handled an iPhone 11 or 10 R then you could go for the slightly smaller better display in the iPhone 11 Pro which will cost you more but it's smaller or if you think it's not big enough you can go for the bigger iPhone 11 Pro Maxx oh and there's another one actually which is just all you want to budget which just generally will put a lot of people in the camp of buying the cheaper iPhone but combo breaker they are still selling iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 are and I think iPhone 10 are at 600 bucks is more competitive if you don't care about the second camera or the camera upgrade small group of people but if you have to get an iPhone that's one to consider but that is pretty much it they did it they made an iPhone 11 that's easy to recommend and it's the new iPhone that people buying a new iPhone should probably just get but that's what happens when you make some improvements on one of your most popular products and drop the price a bit and rename it to just the de-facto iPhone but I also can't let you forget the weight of the 20/20 iPhone is heavy on the horizon and it's definitely too early to get excited for that it's another year away for that phone but that's where I'm looking either way thanks for watching this super easy video and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]
