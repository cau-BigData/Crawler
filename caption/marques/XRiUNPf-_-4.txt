[Music] what's up guys mkbhd here and this is the 1 plus 70 so if you followed the leaks take a a promo you've probably seen pretty much every angle of this thing but now it's officially been unveiled I've been using it daily for about a week and this is a pretty easy phone to explain so one plus the company they have they're sort of upper mid-range phones somewhere around five hundred six hundred dollars like one plus seven then they have their premium high-end flagship stuff like one plus seven pro that's closer to seven eight hundred bucks so this phone the one plus seventy kind of kind of a hard name to say out loud it's not the seventy but it's the one plus seventy this phone is sort of a Frankenstein between those two groups it's right between the super high end and the upper mid-range if that makes any sense so to be perfectly clear it is a really great phone for the price which is basically the oneplus special at this point they've continued this fascinating slow creep up in price but when you go over this phone and everything they've combined in here it's pretty on point for what you're getting for $599.95 combination of things despite not being the highest end display you know it gets pretty bright up to a thousand knits so outdoor visibility is no problem and the teardrop not being a little smaller makes it super easy to ignore on this gigantic screen but it's also 1080p not 1440 and the bezels are just a little bit thicker a tiny a bit as you can see and I have noticed some real off-axis color tint and rain bowing and other consistencies like that that you'll notice on not so high-end OLED displays so it's not the super best of the best but it's like right underneath it's right in between it's making sense right they're bringing things down from the higher end phone that makes sense while keeping the sort of baseline of the mid-range the high refresh rate I think is the most important thing that they brought down that I just I love me some 90 Hertz some high refresh rate goodness so that's good to see and then just the design of this phone in general is also a bit of a Frankenstein you've probably noticed it by now there's this or a blue color again although this time it's not as matte as before it's kind of closer to like a satin because it has more of a sheen to it it's not really glossy like some other phones but you definitely do still see fingerprints much more than a matte phone so it's somewhere in between again the 7 pro is more matte than this one but here's some other improvements you do have the alert slider is tighter so it's it's more satisfying to move between the three positions so that's pretty sweet they brought down the high-end really precise haptic motor that's honestly only really matched on Android by the pixel at this point so that was great and they brought the optical fingerprint reader underneath the glass that's also the same sensor as the one from the 7 Pro and I think one of the best in any phone under the glass right now the speakers are also just as good as a 7 throat they sound loud and full and there's also a bigger speaker grow up at the top and charging is now even faster so they're calling it warp charge 30 T it's still a 30 watt fast charger but thanks to improved battery chemistry in the 3800 milliamp hour battery in this phone it'll charge 23% faster then warp charge 30 already did so in other words it's silly fast and it's kind of a you know a different philosophy on battery management on one hand I love you know the little chunkier phones that'll have this massive battery inside and all-day battery life it changes the way I use phones I didn't worry about charging ever during the day but on the other hand a phone that's really trim like this that has crazy fast charging just lets you have this peace of mind at any time you're starting to get low you can just plug in for a couple minutes and be right back up to set 80% so it's like a different kind of confidence in the battery I don't really have a preference between the two it would be great to have both but as of right now I like having this we're charged 30 t they say we'll get you to 70% from dead in half an hour and that's awesome and I believe that but I'm even more impressed by just how much you can add from plugging in for five minutes ten minutes and just giving you a massive boost for the rest of the day so the seventy does have decent battery life but this is the steady compromise they make for not having the best battery life and then of course the gigantic camera circle on the back it's genuinely I think the first design from oneplus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean like they've done triple cameras before even but this one is very different it kind of reminds me of somewhere between Motorola or the red hydrogen or you might even remember the Nokia Lumia series back in the day so anything is these are essentially the same exact cameras that the oneplus 7 pro already has same standard 48 megapixel standard camera same 117 degree ultra wide and then a shorter 2x telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x so if you're actually looking for some big camera improvements for the 70 that is not what's happening here and it's actually not like the 1 plus 7 pro camera was bad it's just that it was the one part of the phone that wasn't you know best-in-class world class it sort of held it back from being an arguably perfect phone in a way but in a $600 phone in 2019 this set of cameras is perfectly good I've been taking photos and videos with it just to see if I notice any substantial differences around but there isn't anything too drastic still very solid and daylight and a bit color fringy and soft around the edges with close up subjects and passable but not amazing shots in less than ideal lighting if you think about other cameras in this six hundred dollar price range that's about right actually right up until they start to get blown out the water by the $700 iPhone 11 you can take portrait mode shots now in telephoto or standard cameras now which is cool and they are also enabling 4k 30fps video from the ultra wide camera so they've heard our feedback they are going to do that and I think them impressive improvement here is the new super macro mode so you hit this little flower icon in the top corner and you can get way up close to things to point five to eight centimeters away from the camera lens which most smartphones do struggle with if they don't have a macro mode and so with this I was able to take some close-ups that I couldn't even get with the iPhone 11 and then of course this wouldn't be a new one plus phone without really killer high-end on paper specs and so that's what they've done here again so Snapdragon a 55 plus the newest chip eight gigs of ram not 12 and 128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.0 storage so yeah this thing is fast and it's running the latest version of oxygen OS 10 on top of Android 10 which I think makes this the first non pixel Android 10 phone I've used and it's been really good so far I obviously love that they're early 2 updates and performance has actually been really smooth you may have noticed I didn't keep the Android 10 gestures the swipe gestures turned on here's why Android 10 gestures on this phone are a swipe up from the bottom for home 1/2 swipe up for multitasking and then a swipe in from the lower side to go back from anywhere you know what else uses that swipe to go back on the side a lot of Android apps for other things Twitter to switch between accounts flamingo for Twitter tick tick my tasks app YouTube studio Google Photos the Play Store I mean a lot of Google apps use that hamburger menu and the screen is so big on this phone that I don't really want to reach up to the corner with one hand to press the hamburger menu every single time so I don't so I turned it off and I just keep using the buttons for now but aside from that Android 10 has been really nice really smooth as you'd expect on a new phone with a 90 Hertz screen and all the optimizations oneplus is continually working on for oxygen OS they really show so all that for me using this phone has added up to it being a pretty solid set of trade-offs that add up to a pretty good phone for a pretty great price it really feels like they're taking the stuff that they learned how to do better and more efficiently from the 7 Pro and bringing it down to a more competitive price which is a great way of sell a lot of phones now for to be perfectly clear the oneplus 7 pro is still a better phone than this just because of this small bit of trade-offs they've kept a higher quality display higher resolution not as much color fringing and things like that bigger battery less ugly camera bump on the back and the knotch less screen on the front so all of that sort of adds up to a little bit of trade-offs here but overall this is that incremental update you expect from a t phone from oneplus with the X Factor of that 90 Hertz display that is so hard to switch back from so that's the statement that the phone leaves me with is that I'm glad that oneplus is doubling down on the high refresh rate stuff to really make phones feel smooth high refresh rate all the things please this is gonna be a really good buy for people who want to spend like 600 bucks on a phone but for me I'm personally going to be pretty excited about the 1 + 7 T pro names are getting weird but that's the phone that's gonna have the best of the best that I'm looking forward to but yeah not bad I'll have a link below if you want to check it out that's been it thank you for watching and I catch you guys the next one peace
