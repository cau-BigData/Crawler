hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this this is one plus eight now oneplus didn't just also come out with a one plus eight pro this is the phone one plus would mark it as flagship killer right but we all see oneplus slowly moving away from that direction now they have a different slogan fast and smooth and you can tell they're getting away from the flagship killer thing now that they actually make a flagship but this is exactly what I'd expect from the oneplus that I feel like we've always known so this interstellar glow one plus eight star set $6.99 and it has the bleeding edge high-end specs you'd want for fast performance snapdragon 865 with the 5g modems in there eight or twelve gigs of fast Ram ufs 3.0 storage Wi-Fi six like that's all nice it's a fast phone definitely love that but there are a few things here cut down to save cost and I'll compare this a lot to the 1+8 pro so if you haven't watched that it's the previous video firstly pull the like button if you want to watch it to catch up that's there but the story is if you work for one plus and you started off with this nine hundred two thousand dollar phone and you're like alright what are we gonna cut out of this phone to get the price way down but still give people a pretty close to a flagship experience what would we do well this is what they did first of all its overall a bit of a smaller form factor now it's by no means a small phone it's definitely still big it has a six point five five inch display which makes it still a little taller than the iPhone 11 pro max so it's not small but it is a little bit smaller than the eight pro and it's also definitely lighter it's noticeably lighter to me it's 180 grams on paper to be exact and to me it feels comfortable in the hand then there's that display it still has the optical fingerprint reader underneath it's still HDR 10 plus certified and still super color accurate and much brighter than last year which is key so it's super visible outdoors but now it's 1080p resolution instead of 1440 that's a smart move that they've done in the past and it's also now high refresh rate at 90 Hertz instead of 120 Hertz I'd love to get blind tested on this but I've said I can personally see the difference between 90 and 120 Hertz but it's small and you have to be looking for it but I'll definitely prefer either of those two 60 Hertz because that difference is visually huge so this is still high refresh rate so this is a cost-saving trade-off that makes perfect sense it's still a really smooth responsive screen we've seen other phones bring high refresh rate down in price so it doesn't really make this one stand out anymore like it used to but that's not a complaint at all I'm clearly a fan of high refresh rate and I'm glad to see it everywhere plus if you're if you're still in the mindset of you work for oneplus and you're trying to cut down on things you get to say you know high refresh rate and high resolution are nice but if you go too high on those things you cut into battery life so we're giving you 90 Hertz and 1080p and that's a good balance to still give you fast and smooth while being friendly to your battery and that's turned out to be absolutely true this phone has a 4300 milliamp hour battery and it's been impressively good on battery life lasting me easily through the end of every day I've tested it with like 15 to 20 percent left over so it's honestly slightly better battery life than the eight pro which I've been running maxed out so I guess I should expect that so then there's three more trade-offs ip68 wireless charging and the cameras the oneplus 8 doesn't have an IP 68 water and dust resistance certification but this is another one of those instances where oneplus would probably claim they've put the necessary seals and pieces inside the phone and tested it themselves but then passed on the savings of not getting it officially tested I don't know about that I haven't tested mine I'll wait for the jury rig everything test to see those seals thank you very much but then this phone straight up doesn't have wireless charging at all same deals last year it has a glass back but it doesn't have the wireless charging coil to take advantage of that glass back now at 700 bucks there are a way lower number of phones at this price that don't have wireless charging so it's much harder to justify but that's always been I guess one plusses thing you know saying wireless charging isn't fast enough for their standards so again there's still fast water charging here still warped charge 30 T so zero to 50% in 25 minutes and it's included in the box too so all that good stuff but yet no wireless charging it kind of makes me wonder how much per unit like that would cost like could they have just swallowed their pride and put in just an ordinary wireless charging coil on the phone and just been like you know what finally we added it probably but you know then again they are trying to save money but anyway last but not least there is a different and lesser camera array in the oneplus 8 on paper it's a 48 megapixel main sensor and a different one from the pro then a 16 megapixel ultra wide camera and a dedicated 2 megapixel macro no telephoto and to me that's the correct one to leave out but it's funny there's still a telephoto button in the camera app which punches into 2x but like LG did with the v60 that's just a digital crop in from the main sensor which honestly looks just as good if not better than a cheap telephoto would have now this dedicated macro camera it's kind of fun but honestly not very good quality and I'm not just saying that because it's 2 megapixels like it's just lacking quality it's not a great dynamic range and not great color overall quality is pretty lacking so you know I have some fun taking some macros with it but I think it's one of those cameras that you'd forget about after the first week and then the main camera it does have a 48 megapixel number attached to it but again it's a step down from flagship quality in sharpness and detail and in colors and just overall performance I mean it feels like the classic one plus of the past amazing everything else on the phone subpar camera honestly if you're serious about camera quality you probably shouldn't be looking at this phone you should check out something like the pixel 3a or even the brand-new air quotes brand new iPhone se which looks like it'll have a flagship quality camera for 399 an iPhone quality camera for 399 so definitely stay tuned for the video when I get my hands on that phone very soon should be a fun video also in case you've been wondering what color this phone is just because it's it's looked like a different color and like every shot in this video this interstellar glow is a nightmare honestly it's definitely unique I'll give it that this finish underneath the gives it a different refraction index from different angles you get all kinds of wild colors reflecting off of it but it's a hundred percent one of those phones that looks better on camera and in promos than it does in real life this thing catches more finger prints than the CSI agent of the month do I even don't even have to make this segue dangerously close to lioness territory well you should you should consider something a little more low-key channel sponsor debrand will help you clean up your act if you accidentally pull the trigger on this colorway of the phone personally I think this black camo looks pretty tight so all right here's my summary for 1+8 aside from the crazy color I really like this phone it's got a great display it's great performer for the price obviously really high in specs it's not the king for this price but it's great performer it's got the fast charging it's included in the box it's got oxygen OS to which I've talked about in the past as one of my favorite Android overlays and I frequently get software updates too so it's it's a clean package I could tailor this phone right now and I'd probably be super happy it also happens to be one of the absolute cheapest 5g compatible phones on the market right now it's not why I would buy it but that is a nice bonus for longevity having the phone for four or five years but it's not it's not amazing it's not it's not some special phone like it used to be and really it's the stratification of phone prices over these past couple years that has caused this situation like I remember this just a couple years ago maybe it was longer than I think but high-end phones used to just be like five 600 maybe 650 bucks 700 bucks and so it felt like you were either reaching for racing for the top for the absolute highest end bleeding-edge best phone or racing to the bottom for the cheapest phone the best budget phone and so one plus came along and it sort of slipped right in the middle they were undercutting the flagships they positioned the cells as flagship killers because they were somewhere in the middle but now today we have what like 200 to $300 budget phones we have our 400 500 $600 mid-range phones then we have our seven eight $900 premium phones then we four thousand eleven hundred $1400 ultra premium flagship phones and so there's more chaos there's more activity than ever at like all of these different price ranges so today at this price for $6.99 you could get this or you could get if you wanted a smaller phone you could get galaxy s 10 e or if you absolutely had to have 120 Hertz you could get the Polka phone x2 or if you had to have a gaming phone you could get the red magic phone or if you absolutely wanted the best camera quality you should go for pixel 3a or even the new iPhone se plus earpods Pro plus a wireless charger I usually don't go super in-depth with price in my reviews just because that is one of those things that usually changes over time but I think that's that's something I'm gonna be changing now just because the positioning of these phones maybe ever since like the essential phone sometimes is the reason why they they live or die but yeah one plus eight it's a nice phone it's not special anymore but it is one of the favorites in this awkward middle child price point of $6.99 to start but yeah look around there's a whole landscape out there thanks to the stratification of pricing I guess but maybe you can watch other videos about those other options too either way thanks for watching this one catch you guys in the next one very soon peace
