[Music] what's up guys I'm Kip EHD here so I've been using the iPhone 11 Pro for about six seven months now maybe a little longer than that doesn't sound like that long but for this weird world I live in where I'm switching between smart phones all the time testing all these different ones that's kind of a long time actually for me to be using one phone one plus eight pro in the other pocket for those of you who know about the whole dual smartphone situation so I figured you know what let's do a longer term review this is something I've seen a lot more actually on YouTube and I really like it's um I'm jumping in but the original review is usually shot after one to two weeks of using the phone and there's only so much you can pick up in that time and inevitably after that you not try to tweet new things that I find but there are new findings and new things that you learn about a phone that you want to share she follow me on Twitter if you want to see those things when I do share them but that's what this is about so why not take a second look at one of the phones that seems to come up all the time months after it comes out this is the iPhone 11 Pro revisited plus a look forward at I phone 12 okay so one of the things you can get a pretty good idea of when the phone first comes out is build quality not just how it feels in the hand but like really how well it's actually built and iPhones have a pretty good track record at least as of late you know if lasting a long time but they're also glass and glass is glass and I've said it before but I'll say it again until it's no longer true I don't use a case on my phone never really have so this phone just travels around just like this so this iPhone has been in pockets in gym bags with cleats in backpacks you know in car cupholders it gets tossed around a lot and put in a lot of different places now the stainless steel on the sides has held up great looks almost exactly like it did the day I got the phone which you might expect and the matte finish on the back has done a good job of hiding some of those micro scratches a lot better than a glossy your phone would but the front glass not so much some phones get this worse than others and from my experience iPhones tend to get these micro scratches more ease we but you can see on my iPhone a lot of visible scratches all over the display not so bad that it would you know actually interrupt the viewing experience like a crack but they add up as his phone gets used more and more now I'm gonna say a lot of these are because I tend to put my phone facedown on my desk and on counters and other places around me and we know there's plenty of dust and random grit that can just happen to get under there and cut the glass of the phone but it just seems like it's worse on the iPhone than other phones I've used so I'm gonna try to get out of the laying the phone down face down have it internal specs have held up pretty much perfectly and this is what I'm talking about in the initial review when I say it's got tons of performance headroom goes out the box of course every phone feels great and the iPhone is one of the fastest feeling phones you know one to six months later but that's a sort of a trajectory for the two years three years four years later when it's still one of the fastest feeling two three four year old phones that's thanks to the 813 Bionic and four gigs of RAM which don't look like huge specs on paper but this phone is on pace to be doing just fine in four years okay pop quiz what's rule number one of buying a new piece of tech never buy a piece of tech like this based on the promise of future software updates to come never do that just buy it for what it is today and if it happens to get better over the years then a sabonis that I think especially applies to iPhones because they never really add any crazy features like the way you know Android used to be when they would just change everything with a new software update but it's mostly been minor tweaks and bug fixes as definitely more stable now I was 13 when it first launched had a good amount of bugs and they've been ironing those out I had this weird bug with Gmail attachments but that's now fixed Oh than that not too wild in a way it's kind of boring actually if you're hoping for something transformative and new in the software that's not really what I get my hopes up for on an iPhone now the announcements on stage and the way they talk so smoothly about how everything's so magical they might fool you a little bit like remember remember the U one chip in this phone remember that about you could you could point your iPhone at another airdrop device and it would just show up on the top of the list that hasn't really ever materialized so when another big one was a deep fusion remember deep fusion there's a whole thing on stage about how a software update coming later to this new iPhone would bring deep fusion for improved detail and less noise and better sharpness in medium lighting now this wasn't low light that would be night mode and my modes pretty great on this phone but it's not that and it wasn't high light either it wasn't normal daytime photos HDR and all that takes care of it great but this was for medium light well the iPhone definitely got this software update and it definitely has deep fusion now and I definitely can't tell the difference and it doesn't even really tell you which photos were taken with deep fusion on and which ones are just regular photos so yeah I guess the point here is to say at the end of the day it's just good old familiar iOS running on the iPhone just like we all expected there are so many future's here and there but again not too many surprises here and yes the cameras are still really good I've been taking great photos all the time in the months since this phone came out and also also pretty much every video you've seen on my socials you know Twitter or Instagram and every time I go live on Instagram they are with almost no exceptions all from the iPhone iOS 13.2 they finally listened and put video resolution and frame rate controls in the camera app they're a little hard to press but you can go from 30 to 60 to 24 and 4k to HD final okay a couple of smaller things battery life has stayed really good I switched actually to the smaller iPhone 11 Pro I had the 11 Pro max for almost my entire use but I guess when I reviewed the iPhone se it kind of got me missing smaller iPhones for a while so for the first time in a long time I'm not using the absolute biggest available version of a phone I'm using the smaller iPhone 11 Pro now and I was wrong about 3d touch I miss 3d touch 3d touch was one of those things that you know it was the pressure sensitivity of underneath the screen Apple no longer makes any devices that's or 3d touch anymore they've gone back to just haptic touch which is just basically a long press and it's nowhere near as good 3d touch while it wasn't necessarily taken advantage of by every single developer it was actually a really well done and uniquely iPhone feature it set them apart where haptic touch is basically just that long press and it's much slower than the pressure sensitivity was so I'm not sure I wouldn't trade some extra thickness to get 3d touch back and I don't think I'm alone there and then face ID we're all super used to what face ID is by now but it was supposed to get improvements and be better with this new iPhone it's still really good but I think it would feel magical it would feel amazing if they could do just a couple little things namely shrinking the notch and making it work from more angles like from this this sideways angle doesn't work when it's this far off and when it's sideways and upside down and other angles it's not quite as good so actually it doesn't work at all when it's upside down so face ID could be more magical Tim if you're listening but actually Tim I hope you're not listening because let's use that as a way to segue into looking forward a bit at the iPhone 12 when you think about it this phone can look a little bit dated can feel a bit dated it's got those rounded corners it's got the biggest notch in any phone it's still got the proprietary port at the bottom still got a 60 Hertz screen it is one of the fastest feeling phones with a 60 Hertz screen thanks to the hundred twenty Hertz touch refresh rate but it is still 60 Hertz and of course no 5g now iPhone 12 rumors floating around right now point to the boxier shape similar to the iPad pro super looking forward to that 5g should be added as well and adding that lidar scanner from the iPad pro a classic case of the customer paying for a feature they may not ever use just because it comes built into the phone but now there's a whole new lineup of iPhones planned at various price points which are really interesting to me all of which should have 5g so I'm curious which one of these do you think you would get look today iPhone 11 Pro as a flagship it's kind of in this weird place because Apple never updates their prices this phone launched at $1000 upgraded for 1100 and it still costs $1,100 and till the day the next phone comes out in September or October it will still cost 1100 bucks this phone was a pretty good buy when it came out but if you can wait if you waited this long and you haven't bought a new iPhone yet if you can keep waiting to the iPhone 12 I think that's the move I think that's the one to wait for that's the one I'm excited about that's the one I can't wait to upgrade to with that new shape but until then this has been a pretty damn good phone for the months that's been out till then thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
