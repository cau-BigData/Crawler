[Music] it what's up guys not to be here all right couple things number one yes I'm out here in California yet again and yes I'm vlogging number two yes I am wearing glasses and that's because I am getting LASIK eye correction surgery on December 10th which involves not wearing my contacts or we I really gotta learn how to light for reflections here but that's gonna be a thing you'll see temporarily then three yes I am wearing some of the newest merch it is available now it's back in the store for the entire holiday season and if you get it it will ship by the holiday so that's really exciting so if you want that link below and for as I switch hands here I'm out here for the Tesla pickup truck event this is one of the few pieces of tech that didn't leak in 2019 which is actually really impressive but Tesla's been pretty good at that same thing happened with the Roadster so I'm here to see it so if you want my first impressions of a pickup truck from someone who doesn't really use pickup trucks but I'm still curious about an electric one I'm here for that I'm doing my best [Music] all right so this event was pretty wild in a lot of ways I feel like it was the most showy Tesla event in a while you know they had props they had lasers they had a just a lot of excited people and they had an unveiling of a product that they had kept a secret for awhile a pickup truck so leave on he gets on stage he does his intro and pretty quickly it rolls right out and holy mother of Batman what the hell is that that that is not the shape or the look or any of what I was expecting it looks like a like a low poly count render of what the pickup truck is supposed to look like in a video game like it looks like one of those fan made renders that people were making for a month that you'd say oh it totally doesn't look like that but here it is I'd say this reaction from some fellow tech youtubers I was watching with sums it up pretty well it was wild okay so there's really not a whole lot of anything else like it out on the road so there's some stuff you can pick up about it from the livestream and from watching the event and on the site and there's more to learn from actually being here so on stage Elon went over the cyber trucks stainless steel exoskeleton which on one hand sounds really impressive I did a demo of Franz literally hitting it with a sledgehammer and not denting it so that demo went great but also seems very tricky to work with when the entire body is this one piece of metal bodywork must be a nightmare I think but I guess that's not new for Tesla so the body is essentially bulletproof but then there's the windows which they also had some demos for and they had some bold claims about how tough it was and they dropped a heavy metal ball from great heights onto a sheet of it and it didn't shatter cool but then they tossed that same ball lightly at the one actual pickup truck prototype they have working and both times the glass broke didn't completely make it through to be fair but yeah either this prototype didn't actually have the super tough glass or they've got some work to do on that one but then of course there was this specs which were really impressive maybe the most impressive part of the truck so starting at 40 and dollars for a single motor rear-wheel drive with a six and a half second zero to sixty and adaptive suspension all the way up to a triple motor all-wheel drive option that goes zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds and will have a 500 plus mile range and a 14,000 pound towing capacity for reference the 2024 f150 can tow about half of that and that's about all you get from the presentation you get your numbers it rolls onstage you see it so it was up to us to find the pickup truck outside and learn about as much as we can in person so I can tell you exactly what I found from that and basically it is a really striking truck and it's huge it really is massive so your boy was first on line to get a test ride so literally Franz and his family got out of the truck as it pulled up with brand new fixed glass to give us test rides and I hopped in the front seat for a quick little one-minute hot lap and yeah you can tell right away it's very bare prototype feeling on the interior there's another yolk steering wheel similar to the 20/20 roadster prototype it is basically the same touchscreen as a model 3 but with new graphics on it for the cyber truck not sure how final that is but it looked cool and yeah tons of glass tons of space lots of headroom and foot room and you are really high off the ground you really hiking up to get into this thing the rear view mirror if you caught that is a display showing the rear facing camera and the space in the middle between the driver and the passenger is actually a third seat folded down so it's a six seater three seats in the front row three seats in the back and they're both benches so yeah and you kind of get this like marble countertop like blank surface area in the front very strange to me but yeah that's about all I could tell we also did a bit of an acceleration test apparently this is a dual motor variant and I didn't point the camera at the speedometer the whole time I'd say we got up to 60 here's a video I took later from the outside so yeah this thing clearly hauls and it sounds crazy with those tires and all that weight but yeah it's gonna be really fast for a pickup truck of course but yeah I feel like there's just so much to take in and it's also unconventional michael fisher said something to me at the event and he'll probably have a video about it too with his thoughts and I'll link that below when it goes up but one along the lines of well hey at least we're not bored and it's kind of funny the more you think about it the more that is super true about this truck Tesla could have gone with a super cookie cutter design and made it exactly what you'd expect you know just take an existing Tesla design and morph it into a pickup truck take a modern why just cut the back off in fact I love that that's exactly what Simone Geerts did with her model 3 in her incredible video I will link that below and she had her truck 'la here at the event but the cyber truck nah yeah that that cyber truck shares as far as I can tell pretty much no DNA from any other Tesla model outside of I guess just the door handles you know instead of curves it has angles it looks like the cabin is a damn triangle the bar headlights are kind of cool there's also a roof bar headlight the the tail light is a bar the wheels are crazy everything is rethought hopefully for the better and also I did feel like there's a lot we still don't know like when does this come out we didn't get a date but people can already pre order them and reserve them and get online where are the windshield wipers where is the sideview mirrors what's the bed made of that ATV that they brought out at the end and is sort of a one more thing move that they pulled up and fit in the back of the cyber truck and charged it in the back are they selling that to like how much is that going to be is that an option with the cyber truck it kind of looks like a spoiler like the truck looks better with the ATV in the back you know there's just a lot to think about with something where Tesla is attacking this new market but the way things go for Tesla you know kind of like the model why I think we'll start to see the details creep out a little bit as they get finalized and closer to production and as of right now we just have this massive hype unveiling to get people talking about it thinking about it and it's worked and now we have a big wait but yeah it's it's one of the most polarizing automotive designs I have ever seen to me not a truck person it seems super badass like the Mars rover type of stuff I couldn't see myself driving it but it looks crazy but if you ask around seems like people either really like it or really hate it so I'm curious where do you fall on that spectrum what do you think about the cyber truck you can't stay in the middle you got to pick one either way thanks for watching this initial first impressions from the cyber truck event from Tesla more to come catch you guys in the next one bass
