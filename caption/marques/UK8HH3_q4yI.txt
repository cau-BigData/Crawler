[Music] it was up guys I'm Kip EFC here and as you may or may not have heard a new iPhone went on sale today if the new second-generation iPhone se it costs $399 so in 2020 a brand new iPhone for 399 now originally I wasn't going to talk about this until I had it in hand but hey quarantine content right why not talk Tech for a little bit and there are just so many interesting conversations to be had because of this phone at this price fun fact I already did talk about it in depth on the wave form podcast so if you want the long-form discussion version of this it's the link below you can listen to it anywhere but uh yeah there's a lot to talk about the first of all Apple's having themselves a little hit year with minor refreshes so far in 2020 right we had the MacBook Air which is basically a new keyboard and internal speck bump same design and now it's everyone's favorite laptop we got the new iPad pro which is basically the same iPad pro with a lidar camera and an ultra-wide and a new GPU core BAM that's just extending their lead as the best tablet and so now we have the new iPhone se so just so we're all on the same page what is this iPhone se well if you picture the body of an iPhone 8 literally like iPhone 8 cases will work with this new se so imagine an iPhone 8 touch ID fingerprint reader and bezels the whole thing the 4.7 inch retina HD LCD display on the front ip67 wireless charging aluminum rails little thing you've seen an iPhone 8 but then on the inside it has new internals so it's speck bump against oh you got the new a 13 Bionic which is the same chip in a thousand dollar iPhone 11 Pro and three gigs of ram and some other little things if you're paying attention they moved the Apple logo down to the middle of the back of the phone now to match all the newer iPhones so that's how you be able to tell what's an S II and what's an iPhone 8 and are dropping it in three colors it is red black or white and all three colorways will have the black front bezels even the white one so the white iPhone eight had white bezels the white iPhone se has black bezels so that's nice but really it's a pretty simple formula some people have called this a parts bin phone just because Apple's recycling some things they have you know take the a13 over here take the iphone a body they've done this with the iPad in the past but hey they slapped the iconic much-loved SC name on it now it's everywhere well actually it's the price that's making it a crowd favorite that's why it's everywhere but the SC name was smart too so I have a couple thoughts on what make this so crazy and so interesting and I'm curious what your guys thoughts are but number one will this be the best camera in a budget phone and I think it's very possible at least top two like right now if you've watched any other smartphone videos of mine you know the obvious recommendation for a budget phone with a great camera has been pixel 3a by a mile because there really isn't any competition in this price range for a great camera this new iPhone se coming along will have basically the same hardware as the iPhone 8's camera a single 12 megapixel shooter back there plus the benefit of new image processing from the iPhone 11 thanks to the a 13 Bionic so I suspect it's reasonable to assume this camera will be at least as good as the iPhone 8 if not a little bit better thanks to software and I think that puts it right up there against pixel three a it might not be pixel for a when that comes out as far as camera quality but video quality I'm gonna say this one's a safe bet for best video quality and a budget phone then number two Apple joining the spec for low budget race makes it really tough for a lot of the Android manufacturers that have been absolutely feasting down their C for the longest time there has never been an option to buy an iPhone a new iPhone at that low of a price we've seen you know every year new iPhone comes out it's eight nine hundred a thousand dollars even up from that and so they'll maybe bump down the price of older iPhones down to six hundred maybe five hundred dollars but as soon as you wanted to go lower than that there was no new iPhone and so that's where one plus and Xiaomi and Samsung would all be waiting for you but now now there's a new iPhone with an a 13 Bionic for $399 and that's an easy choice for a lot of people that's that's gonna sweep up the rest of the sales that they were missing underneath the price of the low five phone they had before so that is scary if you're one of those Android manufacturers that's been basically thriving at that lower price because of the lower price like it just became a really easy choice for a lot of people I'm super curious actually to see the day one week one sales for this iPhone se then number three is this more likely to be the best budget phone of the year or the best compact phone of the year we actually talked about this exact question on the wave form podcast and the answer we sort of landed on was probably best compact phone 4.7 inch display in the iPhone 8 body size is compact by today's standards it's not the it's not the good ol precious truly se days that we I definitely miss but we're really not expecting too many other flagship quality phones at a smaller size so maybe it's a lock already for compact phone of the year but I think we are likely to see more options to come out and compete at this price so we already know pixel for a is probably coming up soon Samsung's always dropping stuff at this price point we always see all the other competitors very active from 300 to 600 bucks so we're expecting more competition there but yeah as far as small phones it's really easy to talk about how this is not a new design obviously touch ID is old and big bezels on the front are old but I'll get back to that in a second that's not exactly what people are paying attention to add a $399 price but anyway my bottom line right now you know we've been exchanging thoughts about this on Twitter but I think this is Apple's best deal ever which maybe isn't the highest bar ever from a company that's also selling wheels to their computer for $700 so you know it's a great deal from Apple but it is also one of the best deals in all of tech but you really have to think about what most people want what ninety-five percent of people want I think we kind of sometimes catch ourselves in this tech bubble where we're always looking at the bleeding edge high-tech stuff but really it's a small percentage of us maybe maybe 5% of us that care about you know the design and being bezel lists and having a hole-punch versus a notch camera refresh rates all the sort of stuff it's a small percentage so on the face of it this looks like a phone with pretty much no downsides at this price for like 90% of people go ask your your mom or dad or your grandparents or your honour uncle if they care about the screen to body ratio or the spec sheet of your phone the answer is probably no and if you told them they could get a brand new iPhone for 400 bucks and it has the new a 13 Bionic and it's a pretty great camera you can get it in red black or white which is kind of what I'm into it seems like a no-brainer I think we still should reserve judgment for the full review and we actually get to use this thing but I'm thinking okay what do people care about a lot in a new phone screen and you know this happens to be a 4.7 inch screen but it's the same pixel density same color accuracy as the iPhone 11 so that's fine they care about camera and this is an iPhone camera this is ideally iPhone eight quality or better it seems pretty good they care about battery life and honestly an a 13 Bionic in a screen this small probably gonna do fine with battery and then price and this is a $399 phone and it's an iPhone so it's familiar people know touch ID people know iOS and something that's underrated with Apple stuff we don't talk about this that much but software updates the software updates support for this $399 phone because it's an iPhone and it'll get iOS updates for probably four to five years is probably the best for any $399 phone so there you have it a lot of interesting stuff coming from this iPhone se announcement you know usually when we're talking about new tech we're talking about the highest end the bleeding edge of stuff and that's what I like to focus on but I guess the benefit of the world we live in is now that all this stuff is getting so good you can bring down almost the bleeding edge tech way down in price and get stuff like a $399 iPhone that undercuts every single phone one plus has come out with for the past two years it's crazy time to be alive either way that's been it thanks for watching this quick first impression and catch you guys very soon in the next one pace
