hey what's up guys mkbhd here alright story time so it's 2020 folding smartphones are all the rage and there's a bunch of different options now almost none of which you should probably actually buy but I mean we have the galaxy Z flip from Samsung we have the Galaxy fold the Moto razor and then sort of the rest you know everything from the TCL trifold concept phone to the Royal flexpa and you may have seen another story floating around of another folding phone by Escobar yeah that Escobar just a little filler in on the Escobar name if you're not familiar so Pablo Escobar was the Colombian drug lord ended up being known as basically the wealthiest criminal in history for monopolizing cocaine trade into the United States before fun fact he died of a gunshot wound to the head the day before I was born so you know this isn't exactly a positive sentiment around this name like being known for the killings of police officers and politicians and making Colombia the murder capital of the world not the best way to have your name known but it is a known name like y'all have heard of Escobar so now suddenly on every tech website there's this new folding phone with the Escobar name on it curiously and it's getting a lot of eyeballs turning a lot of heads very interesting and it's 3 to 50 bucks and looking at the actual phone it is a curious one it's a gold accent which is a nice touch but if you study the specs or the design long enough at all you literally realize it's just a royal flux pie with a gold accent taped to it so naturally I ordered one so on December 5th 2019 I spent my 350 bucks free shipping and placed my Escobar fold order something a lot of people think about this channel is that like I get everything for free and while it's true that I get review units and I will make first impressions videos with those I end up buying pretty much everything that I review on this channel I got so I haven't reviewed the motor razor folding phone yet for example because I sent the review unit back that's what I did the first impressions with and now the one that I bought spend allayed by several weeks so anyway I didn't reach out to Escobar Inc I didn't even think to ask if they had a review program I just quietly bought one so that was in December and yeah I never got it I mean I guess I shouldn't be surprised it was a little suspicious to begin with I mean you look around their website and it is it's a little suspect there's some pretty wild pictures and statements trying to sell you this phone some some pretty bold claims and it's just overall not the most professional looking website I've ever bought a phone from but I think we knew from the beginning I wasn't I've really ever gonna get this phone like I put down the money in the off chance I was surprised and then hey that would be kind of funny but when I put my order into the tracker they never updated from pending pending it just sort of said it was in production for months so that was it you know we never made a video on it we were sharing some other pretty cool stuff at the time it's sort of went under the radar it was just lost money that's sort of where I thought it would end but then we saw headlines of another new Escobar fold phone it was who's the Escobar fold - and once again there were articles there were headlines there were even some videos of this new thing a $400 Escobar folding phone that looks like this it's a it's looking kind of familiar again oh that's that's just a samsung galaxy fold and then on February 2nd I got an email from Escobar Inc just asking mailing address like what's your mailing address at that point I was again like sort of genuinely interested but after a few back-and-forth so basically declined because I wanted they wanted to guarantee a video by sending it to us and I I wasn't willing to commit to guaranteeing a video just from them sending a phone that's not something we do so they ended up not sending one but but I I did buy a second one because apparently I liked giving money away to anything tech related so maybe if you guys wanna buy the merch and support we won't have to worry about this so much but I bought another Escobar fold too so I still didn't have the first one I went to their site again bought the second one under a different name so now I've given them $750 free shipping both times and I've gotten nothing in return so for a while I didn't get one and neither did many other people but then videos started popping up and this always happens I've I've had this happen before where I declined something in my inbox some opportunity and then a week later I see a bunch of videos about it on YouTube in my sub box etc so this is one of those things I was curious about because the product isn't that great but the company behind it and the the schematics behind it are so weird so I tweeted this zero out of 10 would not recommend didn't get the phone both times I ordered but then that night believe it or not when I got home from the studio to home which is the shipping address that I put in for my first order guess what was waiting for me at my door an Escobar fold box so on February 24th which is like four days after this this tweet and the box showing up I got an email saying that they upgraded my fold one order to a fold to which I guess I believe because it had my name on it from the first order I placed and it went to the shipping address of my first order I placed and other people have gotten the same upgrade happen who who also happened to be tech reviewers so like the only reason I'm talking about this is because it's based around a tech product like I talk tech but if this was happening with like a kitchen appliance product or some makeup product or something else like that I probably wouldn't have cared nearly as much but because it's tech and they really seem to be trying hard to make it seem like a great phone to buy well that's what made it so fascinating to me [Music] okay so the unboxing experience super simple and within about 30 seconds of using a phone and no I'm not putting my sim card in it but from using the phone just for a little bit it's pretty clear this appears to be a legit samsung galaxy fold and the new one at that so I have my regular galaxy fold here with the dust caps on the hinges and the new slightly stiffer hinge and everything and this Escobar fold it's the same phone with a gold sticker glued to it no actually it's it's actually a galaxy fold with gold tinfoil adhesive to it you take a bit of that gold off of the hinge on the back and right underneath is that Samsung logo right where it's supposed to be and the the gold foil comes off the back with a box cutter or a knife or really enough heat to melt the adhesive so it's not pretty but yeah it is an actual galaxy fold fully working - any of the stuff that normally comes in the box and it's a really poor rebranding job it's an actual galaxy fold so from this point if you're reviewing an Escobar fold - you're really just reviewing a samsung galaxy fold with a gold sticker on the back and some weird pre-installed muggshot wallpapers but the galaxy fold costs eighteen hundred dollars and the Escobar fold - costs four hundred dollars so how are they pulling this off well it's not just the lower quality packaging it's not just the lower quality marketing my theory is that they are going through orders finding the names of youtubers or just people in tech media or people who they think will talk about the phone if they get it and shipping those and then just not shipping the rest that's probably why they found my first order cuz I had my name attached to it and why they upgraded me and shipped mine out they were probably hoping I would speak pretty positively about it that's why I tweeted what I did but if you really want to get into it they tell everything on their site so the two main people involved are these two guys Roberto Escobar so Pablo Escobar his older brother and chief of assassinations and this other guy Olaf Gustafson who is the CEO of Escobar Inc now I don't know why both the photos look like mug shots maybe that's their cool vibe or whatever but there's a Twitter account behind this Olaf guy who honestly just looks like a younger maybe somewhat tech-savvy dude who's just convinced this older guy he can use the Escobar name and make them lots more money from it so he's tweeted all these articles and tons of photos with celebrities somehow and he seems very proud of any press he can get in including when he also cloned the boring company flamethrower and tried to get Ilan to stop selling his and when he helped mr. Escobar start a cryptocurrency that didn't exactly work out but the marketing for the Escobar fold is easily the best part so if you go to their YouTube channel which is truly incredible I'll link it below it currently has about fourteen videos on it including a one minute video panning back and forth across five fold phones maybe all that they'd made at that time there's an unboxing video that I'm pretty sure if I show more than about three more seconds of it it's gonna get this video D monetized they have a video called our IP Samsung comm where they take a bunch of non rebranded original Galaxy folds out of the box and then put safety glasses on but no other protective clothing and then just starts smashing Galaxy folds with sledgehammers until they literally catch on fire and if you look it up if you go to our IP samsung.com which is in the title and this whole videos point the Escobar guys bought that URL and they have a redirect to Escobar inc.com which is crazy because this phone wouldn't exist without Samsung's phone and then there's two other endorsement videos so I guess this is really how you make sure you sell a lot of phones from Chris Hanson and Anna unka hey guys Chris Hanson here of Hanson vs. predators and To Catch a Predator I just wanted to tell you all that I've seen this amazing new smartphone called the Escobar fold tube it appears to be the best phone out right now I've been looking at the transcripts so have a seat check it out and remember I'll be watching it's probably a good thing they disabled comments on these videos hi I'm gonna ain't get from Sweden I used to be married to the singer Paul Anka and I just wanted to tell you that they're Escobar's faulty smartphone it's a really really incredible innovation from some amazing people in Stockholm Sweden I'll hope you guys will enjoy it and use it a lot lots of love mmm I also conveniently both of these celebrities are on a site called cameo which is where you can send requests and pay 50 or 100 bucks or so and get a personalized video in return I'm pretty sure videos on this site are typically like Oh have a Arnold Schwarzenegger say happy birthday to your friend or something I doubt that these two people even know that their videos are being used to help promote a scam so look I'm a tech reviewer so I'm typically just focusing on the final product the finished thing should you buy it or not but this piece of tech we've reviewed already it's the Galaxy fold I've talked about it it just has gold tin foil on the back so the interesting part now becomes the behind-the-scenes part which is the company that's trying to maybe sell some of them and also not ship most of them they're trying to scam you it's one of those situations where you know you have to take any preferential treatment you might get with a gigantic grain of salt so I guess the lesson we've learned is there are way way way too many cases of people not getting there Escobar fold for me to ever recommend you ever buy anything from this company so don't don't buy an Escobar fold too if you want a galaxy fold that is very pricey but I also typically don't recommend you buy one either and and just for your own safety of money don't buy anything that any of these guys are associated with at all I took the hit so you don't have to there you have it if you want an Escobar fold review watch my galaxy folder view I've already done it link below the like button if you want to check it out that's pretty much it that's the truth thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
