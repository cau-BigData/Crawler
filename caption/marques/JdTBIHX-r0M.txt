[Music] [Music] hey what's up guys I'm Kim PhD here and these are the power beats Pro that's right I'm reviewing beats so you may have seen or heard about these in various ads like the one you just watched and I do got to say even though everyone in that actual commercial was technically a professional athlete I still think the word Pro is overused in products like why are these the power beats Pro but that's a rant for another day at the end of the day these are just headphones so when I started using these I just want to know how good of headphones are they and are they worth the money because they are two hundred and fifty dollars so they better be good then again they are beats now it turns out spoiler they are pretty great I still think they're overpriced but as wireless earbuds they're pretty great so you can think of these as air pods but if Apple actually cared about them staying in people's ears so easily my favorite part about these power beats Pro is how they're built like I've never been a huge earbuds kind of guy but for working out and for moving around and things like that you have to have something lightweight so that's why I prefer earbuds and I just got to stay in my ears and be comfortable ear pods never really fit in my ears I wasn't as lucky as a lot of you guys but there are two main differences with these versus air pods that actually keep it in my ear so number one similar to Jaybirds i've had in the past these have a soft touch replaceable ear tip that you can put different sizes on so instead of having just hard plastic one size fits all these are soft touch and they fit pretty well and the number two this piece that goes basically over and around your ear and then holds it snugly to hold the earbuds in and these I mean you can either get the kind that go into the ear up here or over and around I actually really like these the first pair of earbuds I ever really used a lot in high school also had these and they're they're not coming off so just generally I like the design I got the black ones so they're all matte black plastic sweat proof of course and the clamp force wallet is snug it isn't too tight and the sign of any good pair of headphones is that you can wear them for a long time and after a while you just kind of forget you're wearing them that good okay they also differ from air pods in a couple of not-so-great ways the first one being this case it maybe looks like a small case which is me holding it in my hand but this is a huge case I mean I guess I do love that they include a matte black protective hardshell case with them with built in battery and charging there's a little light on the outside of the case and there's a pair of button on the inside that's all great but this actually makes me really appreciate the air pods and they're super small wireless charging case of course air pods are smaller but the air pods case is actually pocketable easily the beats case just is not so that's kind of a big deal sometimes if you're you know walking around and you just don't have a bag if you have a gym bag you can toss it in there but if you don't this is not great in the pocket and then the case only charges via lightning so no USB type-c and no wireless charging so even with all this space and even putting them actually in the case was this motion that for some reason I never quite got used to obviously air pods you just drop it in there and there's magnets and it's super easy these have magnets too and you can see the pins but it's not quite as smooth you have to get the angle just right I don't know maybe that's just me but then the best difference with these versus air pods is the actual but so number one they actually do sound better yeah you know they're a little bit bass heavy but I mean come on would you expect their beats I'm not looking for a flat sound signature here they're fun good sounding headphones this seal that you can create with the rubber tip in your ear plus the clamp force on the side and them not coming out they're a rich good sounding pair of headphone but then number two the actual physical buttons on them there's no touch points there's real buttons so on the right year the beats logo is a button and that can be your play pause of course double tap for the next song triple tap for the previous and on top of each earbud is a volume rocker so this is better than voice control better than the swiping across panels of the sides of headphones it's just simple and easy regular volume rocker and not over-engineered love it of course if you still want to use voice control you can they have the h1 chip so you can do a little hasty reaction if you have an iPhone and they'll still respond to that sorry for triggering anyone's home pod if anyone still has home pods out there but anyway that brings us to a couple of ways that these are similar to air pods by the way I'm comparing these two air pods because well Apple bought beats so beats are Apple headphones now but also because they're just the most popular headphones everyone has so if there's that so the power beats Pro have the h1 chip in them which means they do that sweet instant pairing with an iPhone or just regular bluetooth pairing with any Android phone just like air pods and there's also auto play pause when you take them out your ears and put them back in they'll also do the Siri voice command if you're into that or if you're on an Android phone you can long press the beats logo to trigger Google assistant or whatever assisting you use and then the battery life is just as good so thankfully eight plus hours of playback easily has automatic standby if you put them down when they're not in the case they can go for me like a week without charging if I start with a full battery and a full case and on top of that there is fast charging so if they're dead you can drop them in the case for like five minutes and it gets you over an hour of listen time so that's pretty clutch so air pods to are already pretty expensive at 160 bucks but like I said these are two hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of power beats Pro so while they are better than air pods yes especially for someone like me I still don't know if I can say they're worth two hundred fifty dollars I guess if you absolutely must have the completely wireless you know no wire between the buds then you know I guess that makes sense these are some of the best ones especially if you're an athlete if you need them to be sweat proof you need them to stay in your ears while you move around a lot you need workout headphones I wouldn't blame you if you got these you probably be very happy with them but just because these are so expensive I feel like you can easily recommend something I've used in the past and jaybird X fours they do have a wire between them but they're super lightweight great battery life sweat proof they stay in my ears just fine and there's somewhere around like a hundred 110 bucks so I'll leave links to the alternative stuff that I'm talking about right below the like button as well as links to the beats but I think the price is the only thing holding these back over all the stamp of Apple is very evident on the power beats Pro from the h1 ship to they're very high price tag but overall there's not much negative there's not much bad to say about these so credit for that they actually made a good pair of headphones and I live up to the ads so that's that's good to know regrets I think I just recommend that a pair of Beats on video thanks for watching get you guys in the next one peace
