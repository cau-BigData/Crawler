you know a gold iPhone is already kind of a flex but have you ever wanted to flex so hard it doesn't even make financial sense anymore all right here's a new phone this is the iPhone 11 Pro Sol Arius zenith buy caviar [Music] all right what's up guys I'm kid Bhd here shout to everyone else on family tech support duty during holidays I feel you so this there's literally nothing I can say about this one that's useful to a normal person this is purely just a showcase of a fun and ridiculous iPhone 11 Pro Mod because you really just don't get to see something like this every day so this boutique this small company out of Russia called caviar they've reached out and they wanted to know if I wanted to check this thing out it said would you like to check it out I said okay and then they flew someone here to hand-deliver it so what exactly is this this is a Space Gray iPhone 11 pro with the glass back replaced by a massive mechanical clock structure plated and covered in 24 karat gold and exactly a hundred and thirty seven diamonds it's ridiculous and actually the ridiculousness starts from the unboxing experience so after you get past the included pair of microfiber gloves and a cloth sleeve you get to the phone box and the phone itself is in this custom black and gold box [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] okay so the peel was just as satisfying as any normal iPhone and then for all the accessories we'll blow it there's another section of this custom box with some paperwork including a certificate and a serial number and a one-of-one certification and then you have three black boxes with your caviar accessories first box is a USBC charger in the box of an iPhone with a fast charger in the box so you could its I guess you have to spend a hundred thousand bucks on an iPhone to finally get a fast charger in the box and a second box is a lightning cable and a couple of smaller things including a custom gold-plated shark shaped SIM card removal tool this golden rod thing that we'll get into in a second and then this third box is a completely custom pair of matte black air pods pro and a painted case with painted logo and painted air pods complete with the gold caviar logo that took me off-guard that's actually pretty impressive Wow okay so the accessory bundle is really legit I was impressed with that but that's not what we're here for the main attraction is clearly the phone first thing you'll notice and this is not a joke this is super serious this phone is incredibly heavy as soon as you pick it up you'll notice this I put it on a scale against a normal gold iPhone 11 pro the caviar phone weighs more than twice as much 434 grams that's more than two Galaxy Note 10.1 at the weight of the one gold caviar phone so yeah it's heavy in the hand it's thick too which you can obviously see and then of course there are tons and tons of details to admire the lines the concentric circles the engravings that diamonds all over it it is absolutely nuts but it's all still connected to a regular iPhone 11 Pro it does have a pre-installed pretty low res cavy our wallpaper and the region is set to Russia but other than that the functionality is exactly the same the great camera the great battery life the whole thing I mean you know what an iPhone is although I guess you don't have wireless charging anymore you're gonna lose that and then you might have also noticed the text on both sides on one side is the name-brand and you're limited edition number one of one which is so sick and then on the other side you get a little more info it's an iPhone 11 Pro it's 24 karat gold it's got diamonds and it's a caviar phone so what was that rod thing from before the thing in the unboxing well the clock on the back of this phone did you even notice that the clock the clock on the back of this phone is a fully functional mechanical watch instrument thing because of course it is so you get this gold-plated rod in the box with the logos printed on the caps and you can unscrew it to reveal a hex tool and it turns out this hex tool is what you use to wind up the watch at the beginning of each week on the corner here you can use that to wind up the spring mechanism and that gets it going and it just keeps running all right actually looked it up it's called a terbium apparently I'm probably saying that wrong who will be you but if you want to learn more about them yourself you can just read the Wikipedia page for that word I'll link that down below if you want to have your mind blown a bit but now you have a working mechanical watch complication on the back of your hundred thousand dollar phone it clicks and ticks constantly and you can hear it all the time especially if you have your phone up to your ear to make a phone call now I don't actually want to put my SIM card in this Russian phone to test it here if you can hear the audible ticking through a phone call but yet trust me you can hear it okay I also noticed there's a glass screen protector pre-installed to really protect your investment I personally almost never use these but there you go it's on the phone and yeah if you go spec one of these out on their site right now you can have a similar one made this one as SPECT is a hundred and one thousand five hundred ninety dollars and if you go up to the iPhone 11 pro max since it's bigger it's much more expensive because there's more gold and just for the hell of it spec it up to half a terabyte that's one hundred twenty one thousand two hundred eighty dollars but also limited edition one of one so that's kind of sick I couldn't eat that I was gonna drop it so what why why does this exist why does anything like this exist because you've seen like those other random insert luxury item here plated in gold costs ten times what it should you've seen that right the answer is again kind of like the others just because they can and and there's a small group of people who will appreciate the customized mastery of the mechanical engineering that goes into a watch face like this I mean think of the whole watch world matter of fact luckily on the last episode of the waveform podcast shout out to it if you want to check out our new podcast it is also linked below we spoke to kevin o'leary aka mr. wonderful on Shark Tank and I was just chatting with him for a bit and at a certain point we noticed I was wearing an Apple watch Series 5 and he was wearing an $80,000 collector's item one of one watch with a special red band and we talked about it you know the other day I looked I was looking at this watch and a woman beside me who I didn't know said what time is it I said I have no idea she said you just looked at your watch I said that is nothing - at the time I'm appreciating the art the mastery of making this piece which is one of ten in the world and it just brings a tear to my eye and I love to look at it yeah I have no idea what time it is I don't care yeah so for that person with a penchant for collecting stuff and appreciation for the mechanical engineering going on here I could totally see that incredibly wealthy person getting this phone reaching in their pocket to pull it out and just staring at it I mean sure there's technically a clock on the back but are you really reading that maybe just turn the phone over and see the time with the digital clock on the front but go right back to enjoying the crazy design on the back and that's it to be clear I don't think this is a great idea for most people it's a pizza of text still it's kind of like how that Apple watch edition gold version never really took off and Apple eventually discontinued because there's a new one next year but hey if you gotta flex this hard just start a conversation I guess that's a hell of a conversation man so that's pretty much it this is the opposite of the tech that I normally play with where we're like hey should you buy this should you not but I figure this is an opportunity I probably we will never get again to hold $100,000 phone like this so I figured I'd share that with you guys right back to the stuff we typically talk about in the upcoming videos and again shout out to the waveform podcast down below we're on Episode twelve already coming out on Friday I think it's been pretty fun either way thanks for watching donate to team trees if you haven't already by the end of the year talk to you guys the next one peace okay so that was clearly a video about something extremely expensive that you should probably never buy but you know it's not extremely expensive that you probably should buy this sponsor to this video which is Nord VPN so just having a VPN in general is great and it's useful and I've explained it before in previous videos but protecting your data online is very important but also just selfishly the ability to be able to check to see if a website looks differently to people in Russia for example than it does in your home country using a VPN and the site will never know that that's what you're doing another useful feature so Nord VPN is having a holiday sale right now and you can see that at Nord VPN comm /mk VPN or if you want to just use promo code MK VPN that would get you a three-year plan at 81% off plus two amazing gifts for these holidays which are four additional months for free and the Nord Pass
