[Music] read me k20 Pro depending on who you are you've either heard a ton of hype around this for a while now or this is literally the first time you're ever hearing about it right now I feel like this phone picks up right where the polka phone left off it's very similar to the polka phone in more ways than one but instead of just nailing a few key specs for a super low price this red-meat k20 pro feels like a super complete all-around basically flagship level phone it has essentially everything for 400 bucks and that's why it's blowing up it's definitely more expensive than the 300 dollar polka phone which is absolutely crazy but this in this package is definitely a better more all-around phone you'll see what I mean but first I want to address the whole naming scheme so when I was first put onto this phone you guys put it on my radar a lot of tweets at me a lot of emails asking me to review red-meat k20 Pro so I look it up and it looks like this so I looked out on my desk and I already have this phone right here so I'm like oh I already have a k20 Pro except it's not it says says me on the back and it came in a box from Xiaomi that said Xiaomi me 90 there's a couple other slightly different things about it but they look nearly identical so I look up the specs of this mean 90 to see how similar they are it's essentially exactly the same as the k20 Pro but with a snapdragon 730 but then I unbox it and I log in to my Google account on it and it says welcome to your read me K 20 which is making me even more confused but then I finally do get the read me K 20 Pro turns out the K 20 Pro is just an upgraded version of the K 20 this has the Snapdragon 855 the K 20 has a Snapdragon 730 which has a global version called the Xiaomi me 90 which is an upgraded version of the Xiaomi me 9 if you follow all of that but none of that really matters what matters is the K 20 Pro deserves the attention is getting because it legitimately tries to include literally everything you could possibly expect out of a flagship but out of lower price now it's not all the highest-quality it definitely has a quantity it has almost everything but it's still a 400 ollar phone so aesthetically first of all it's pretty unique looking with the colors sort of dancing down the sides and then depending on how the light hits it this shimmery pattern changes it's pretty cool but it's actually also still glass and still a fingerprint magnet but this thing is already starting off with a leg up you typically expect budget phones to have plastic and cheap materials this one is legit metal and glass USB type-c you got it a slight curve to the bag glass you got it headphone jack you got that a full-screen display from top to bottom thin bezels you got it pop-up selfie camera you got it a built-in LED light fingerprint reader underneath the glass you got that too four thousand milliamp power battery you got that Snapdragon 855 it's all here pretty much the only hardware thing this guy is missing if you're comparing it to flagships is water resistance and wireless charging so you know it is a glass back with no wireless charging I've said before if you're gonna do that just go with a high quality plastic so you avoid being breakable but oh well so like I've said the list of things that this phone has as you've heard is kind of amazing but the actual quality of all these different things varies not all specs are created equal the natural place to start as a display and it's pretty nice to be honest it's a six point four inch 1080p AMOLED no notch thin bezels and it's pretty bright its visible outdoors with fairly decent colors maybe a little big if anything but we're so used to seeing so many budget phones with either big chins and big bezels or smaller screens or notches this one's just clean and it's flat so I'm reminded again of how much I liked this versus the displays that sort of spill over the sides so I really like this screen to me this is the best display in any mid-range phone and then underneath that display glass there is a fingerprint reader which again that's pretty impressive for a mid-range er at the fact that it's there in the first place but this reader itself it's not that fast so you can kind of get used to it it's a little bit of a delay when you press it but it's in this weird place where it's slower than most other in glass fingerprint readers on great phones but also slower than the capacitive ones are used to but at least it's cooler it's under the screen and then like we've also seen lately to achieve the full screen design pop-up selfie camera and this one has a light on it I don't know if that achieves anything other than looking kind of cool but the mechanism is decently fast it's rated for 300,000 opens and closes you can't use it for RGB face unlock but I don't recommend that and it even has automatic freefall detection so if you're taking a selfie and you drop the phone and it has a freefall it actually closes the camera app and shuts it to avoid damage if it lands on it but a low-key pretty important part of it is that light in the selfie camera actually shines through the top of it so it can act as a sort of a notification LED so you can see if you're plugged in and charging it lights up to tell you and when you're finished charging that changes really the only thing I don't like about this selfie camera is the photos it takes which are straight garbage like this is possibly the worst selfie camera I can remember using since I started to review phones there's absolutely no dynamic range colours are pretty terrible at a very very soft detail yes beauty mode is off like I just don't know why it's this bad but you know what makes it even more crazy how good the back cameras are this k20 Pro again has yet another flagship looking spec an array of triple cameras on the back a 48 megapixel main camera an 8 megapixel telephoto and a 13 megapixel ultra wide so that main sensor is a Sony it's an amx 586 so it's the same sensor that we've seen in a couple other honor and vivo phones that have performed pretty well it'll shoot 4k 60fps video with any of the camera lenses so yes you can shoot video with the ultra wide camera unlike the 1 plus 7 Pro it'll even shoot 960 FPS slow-motion now it's not high resolution at all but you know definitely more of a gimmick but that's still pretty cool and then for photos I was of course expecting maybe some average photos some that maybe look better if they're in great light and I was very impressed obviously if you give it a ton of light you're going to get the best out of the sensor and this stayed true HDR was working pretty great but even the ultra wide camera was giving me some nice shots the every production wasn't too oversaturated or overdone with the processing sometimes you see too much sharpening in these phones that wasn't here I was more impressed often than I thought I would be it's not the fastest camera in the world but overall the image quality not bad and even at night like in in dark environments where you expect it to fall apart yeah it totally does the noise reduction goes super overboard and everything is super soft and it looks terrible but if you happen to have a subject that will sit still for you and you turn on night mode you get some of your sharpness back and the dynamic range actually improves like that's that's that's pretty good that's not bad so really the only thing left is using the phone every day and again like I said technically on paper it has all those things you'd expect from a flagship snapdragon a 55 six or eight gigs of ram and up to 256 gigs of storage so it's running MIUI 10 on top of Android Pi and this is not my first choice but it's growing on me so aesthetically this is why it's not my favorite but functionally it's not lacking at all the app drawer with the search bar at the bottom is nice for each ability it actually has a nice clean brightness slider that I've liked for a while it's like always available but the glassiness of it all and the the icons just certain things are a little too much for me and that's kind of their aesthetic right now but overall performance I'd say it was about a B and this is something I actually expect it to be better when you have these high-end specs but the animations weren't really smooth all the time I got occasional hiccups with the keyboard and with opening stuff minor things but stuff you don't really expect to see from a phone with a 1080p display and a high-end chip so it's still fast but not really that smooth if that makes sense but that battery though that four thousand milliamp hour battery they put in this phone gives it a battery life that is right up to par with the other flagship sometimes better than the 1 + 7 / I've been using and not only does it have a really large battery and support fast charging but it also comes with a fast charger in the box and it has this sweet charging animation so the battery life situation is pretty great on this phone look I'm going to tell you right now for the price red-meat K 20 pro is a great phone it I think it gets you the closest to forgetting that you spent half what you could have spent on a high-end phone it gets you the closest to that but a lot of this is easy to just point out on paper when you actually use it there are certain things that keep reminding you that it is a cheaper phone the vibration motor for example pretty cheap pretty loose not very good and when you feel that all the time you're reminded also the single mono speaker at the bottom is super easy to block and that's pretty bad so if you do audio all the time you're reminded the selfie camera like I talked about is just absolutely comically awful and even little things like the slower fingerprint reader you might not know it's slow if you haven't used a more expensive phone but I definitely did notice it but for the most part the important stuff the big stuff your specs your overall solid build quality your solid performance the headphone jack is a nice touch and the display being better than I expected sort of fits this where the polka phone left off which is a really really great value and kind of like that polka phone even if you never buy this redmi k20 pro or even the xiaomi me 90 this is still a testament to how good these mid-range and budget phones have gotten lately so maybe I can't say good phones are getting cheap anymore maybe we'll put a little strikeout through that one but I definitely can say cheap phones are getting good and I'm glad this one exists to be a part of that movement that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
