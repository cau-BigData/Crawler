[Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and welcome to the dream phone 2019 so this is something i thought a lot about there is no perfect phone there never has been and even with tech getting better and better and amazing phones out now it kind of feels like there never will be but it's always been sort of fun to speculate what if you could Frankenstein together the best possible version of a phone with all the available parts and bleeding edge tech what would that look like last time I made a video about my dream phone was 2014 so five years ago baby marques speculating about the best tech available and what the most amazing phone would look like and it looked like this you know I was asking for a Snapdragon 805 3 gigabytes of RAM 128 gigs of storage and a 3500 milliamp hour battery in my dream phone so clearly times have changed I don't know about then you know the doubling of every two years as Moore's law suggests but things have clearly taken major strides since those lofty goals so this is my new look at a concept for a dream phone 2019 plus some renders to go with it knowin all honestly I'm not too picky like I already really like some of the phones we already have that I've talked about during the year I already tweeted like my simplified version of the dream phone would be something like one plus seven pro basically with all the specs and the 90 Hertz display and the OS and everything with the p30 pros battery and the pixels camera like that would already be amazing but this is the dream phone so we can really dream big and we can be more specific since we already know the possibility of it happening is near zero so that's exactly what I'm gonna do so the specs now specs are less important than they used to be but for the sake of getting them at the bleeding edge I'll start off by taking the chip from the iPhone 10 SB 812 Bionic is incredible and as great as the snapdragon 55 is obviously the a12 ionic is the champ as far as power so I'll take that but then I will take the rest of the specs from the fastest phone I've ever used which is the 1 plus 7 Pro which means 12 gigs of superfast RAM and the ufs 3.0 flash storage and sent this the dream phone it'll all just magically work together and then the amount of storage is actually less important than it's ever been because of all this cloud stuff like I feel like I could actually be fine today with 128 gig phone I actually download fun fact my entire Spotify library offline in the highest quality possible-- every time I get a new phone just for flights and that's less than a hundred gigs so I could be fine with 128 but for the hell of it since it's the dream phone and we got that ufs 3.0 just give me a terabyte of flash storage so that's the internals then let's get to the looks the design the hardware so I'd have a very clean minimal aesthetic for the hard work and the overarching theme would be as you guessed matte black and then you know with just a little bit of red accents and some carbon fiber so up front I would take the display from the oneplus 7 pro but modified a little bit taking it to the next level like that's clearly already a great panel but give me 120 Hertz OLED this time still 1440p and also give me the brightness of Samsung's panels and make it a little bit smaller so I love the 1 + 7 pros full screen already of course but if I had my way it would be that little bit brighter outdoors like the Samsung screens it would have a little bit less rounded corners as well and it would be a little bit smaller so I'd say a 6-inch 1440p 120 Hertz OLED now a display like that needs a battery champion as we know so this is a phone that's fully allowed to be a couple extra millimetres thicker all the better to get rid of a camera bump I'm cool with this phone having a little bit extra space to fit the dream 4500 milliamp hour battery so give me the give me the battery from the red hydrogen but also with the warp charging of the 1 + 7 Pro that'll be crazy and you can see in this design it's all matte black with a slot of carbon fiber down the side just for kicks give me a colored power button of course in red thin bezels as you can see oh and yes I'm keeping front-facing speakers and then also since I think glass backs are kind of a bit overrated and since I've also been really impressed recently with plastics the the matte black on this phone can be polycarbonate so when you drop it won't shatter it's all matte black and it can also now enable wireless charging now I could go for the fully all screen bezel with dream phone that the world seems to be moving towards but I don't think that's my dream phone right now specifically because I still like a good pair of front-facing speakers and the the piezoelectric front facing behind the glass speaker is there okay for an earpiece but they're just not cutting it for the big sound that I want so my dream phone would still have a little top slot little bottom slot front-facing stereo speakers and also yes I'd keep that headphone jack because yes while I have moved on to not really needing it anymore every once in a while it's convenient just to have one so throw quality DAC behind that and of course USB type-c and then also that speaker slot up top gives me room for real front-facing cameras so no no not needed no hole punch no crazy mechanisms no pop-ups that don't make it water-resistant this can be a water-resistant phone with real front facing cameras and I have two of them I would take both the front-facing cameras from the pixel three than normal and the wide-angle they're incredible quality of course and I love having quality front-facing camera so those your speakers and your cameras and speaking of cameras you may have noticed the dual rear facing cameras on the back of the phone and I've spoken on this before but I would take the pixel threes photo quality from the cameras and the iPhones video quality is the best of both worlds pixel three does an incredible job with just a single lens for images but I would actually love to see a second lens with the same quality hardware for amazing wide-angle shots and since again it's my impossible dream phone both of these are optically stabilized and they can both do iPhone quality video and then to top it all off my one bleeding-edge which is an under display fingerprint reader that is the entire bottom half of the display so no more like fidgety having to get it just right and lifting up your finger too fast you just put your finger anywhere on the bottom half and it unlocks super fast and then toss in oxygen OS or stock Android honestly either way would be fine with me I think there's a couple pixel specific features that I'd want like the now playing song ID that's pretty sweet and call screening so it would definitely have those things and just for kicks iMessage for Android cuz why not but generally I've been really happy with the high refresh rate clean Android experience and wrap it all up in a nice poke a phone type of price and I I think that's my Frankenstein of a dream phone for 2019 am I missing anything again I know a phone like this doesn't exist couldn't exist but I also know that you know making my voice heard about a dream like this can possibly push the dream just a little bit closer to reality so there you have it all so this video was a collab with concept creator super-skilled with the sick renders to help visualize the phone that we were talking about in this video so I'll go subscribe to his channel if you want to see more stuff like that but that's been it that's my dream phone what would your dream phone be let me know in the comments below either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one Tacey
