[Music] what's up guys I'm PHP here you know there used to be entire YouTube channels dedicated big ones to just reviewing cases you know laptop cases I phone cases I never really got super into that because I was like you know how interesting could a case really be I'm not a big case guy but this is got to be the most interesting case we've seen in a long time this is the new Apple magic keyboard case for the new iPad pro 300 bucks for the small one and 350 bucks for this bigger one and there was a lot of hype for this case right it was announced alongside this new iPad which was barely actually different from the previous iPad pro but along with the new mouse and cursor support on the iPad it Reese toked this whole fire of can the iPad pro be a full time computer so I've been using this new iPad and this magic case as my primary computer for the past couple days and all weekend and the conclusion I've gotten to is this is the best version of the iPad as a computer for sure but I would still rather have a laptop let me explain so for your money this is actually a pretty substantial like nice case there's a lot going on here it's a top part full of magnets that locks on the iPad and does not let go like it's a strong magnet pattern matching up to the iPad then there's a hinge which is like this long metal tube through the middle with a USB type-c pass-through port on the side for charging then a base which is the silicon rubberized material we've seen in Apple cases before with a full-size backlit keyboard and trackpad and it's a lot of material it's a bit thicker and heavier also than you might be imagining you ready for this iPad pro weighs this big one 640 grams and then without the iPad the case by itself weighs another 702 grams so it weighs more than the iPad so combined they are thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air and so while it's not nearly as elegant to open and close like a laptop would be the one thing you can say about this case is it is well built to get this in place basically you open this up and quickly you find that the hinge has this locking point where it gets to the locking point and it snaps into place and that's nice and on the top part continues opening like a hinge so you've opened it like this you take the ipad you lock it with the magnets into the top half everything lights up the pins are all connected and now it's floating above the keyboard as advertised now we've already seen iPad cases with keyboards before there's plenty people already using them but there's a couple things that make this one so impressive number one is that hinge it's pretty stiff like a laptop and it is limited in how far back it goes but actually find it goes just far back enough for any of my normal use it just kind of pops off the back and hovers the iPad there then the keyboard is really nice I think it's the nicest part it's scissor switches so it has a nice travel and it actually feels clicky like the new MacBook Air and 16 inch MacBook Pros keys and since the board is stiff and well built there's actually no flex at all unlike some laptops and then it's backlit which no doubt sucks a little bit of extra power from the iPads battery but I like the back light it's a nice touch it fades on and off and just generally yeah it's it's the best keyboard I've ever seen in an iPad case that's fax and then of course there's the trackpad too it's not the biggest trackpad in the world like you might find on a full-size laptop but it is nice and it definitely completes the laptop computer feel with the new iOS cursor and it clicks it really physically clicks so everywhere from corner to corner which is nice so now you have the iPad hovering above the keyboard here with just enough room to type and not really ever touch the iPad usually for me that's good and so now it feels like a computer the USB type C charging pass-through is at the bottom like where a normal computer port would be and I seem to be getting almost a hundred percent efficiency through those pins which definitely impressed me so it's like a real 13 inch laptop ish computer with a hundred twenty Hertz screen and iPad OS and all of its quartz so let me tell you there are still a lot of quirks to this the your main computer first of all weight management is something we often think about with these iPad cases in a laptop you open this by the hinge and all the weight all the guts in the computer are at the bottom and the top is just a light weight screen so opening and closing it pretty elegant not a whole lot of problems there but with the iPad in this case or any case like this the iPad is the computer and so most of that weight is up top and so it can feel a little bit top-heavy this is part of why they made this case so heavy is to try to combat this a little bit to try to make it feel a little bit less top-heavy but still it's not perfect this whole thing here it's still a pible in some positions that's a new word right laughable most of the classic laptop positions are still fine I know some people were wondering about this it's better than you might expect but from experience it's still not as flexible as a truly bottom weighted laptop where the hinge is just moving the screen weight and then if you get down to the keyboard great keyboard like I said physically speaking but there's no escape key so if I want to exit a full screen video or use anything you typically escape you have to touch the screen and you've probably noticed by now there's no function buttons at all on this keyboard meaning there's no brightness volume or even keyboard backlight brightness shortcuts here for all that you got to touch the screen in fact just to change the keyboard brightness you have to go into the Settings app into general into keyboard settings and then into keyboard hardware settings and then that's where you can manually turn up or down the keyboard backlight brightness luckily auto brightness is typically still pretty good it's using the iPads sensors by the way so that's hopefully not something you have to do very often but still you get the point here and then also I on a Mac I'm a I'm a command Q person as a lot of Mac people are whenever I want to quit an app command Q to close it it doesn't quite work the same way here if you're in an app and you hit command Q nothing happens you have to touch the screen or command H to go home but if you actually do want to close an app in your multitasking without touching the screen shout out to Peter McKinnon actually for teaching me this you go to the command tab menu and then find the app you to close in there and then command queue to close that and then you know like normal with an iPad there's a bunch of gestures from the trackpad and keyboard shortcuts to learn in fact if you hold down command at any point in anything it'll show you a list of all the keyboard shortcuts available to you at that time in that app so that's a pretty cool pro tip but that represents a little bit of a learning curve if you've come from something else with a keyboard so at the end of the day let me let me wrap it all up with this my MacBook Air spec is twelve hundred bucks this iPad pro the 13-inch the same size screen is a thousand bucks plus the $350 case that makes it 1350 now if I could only have one if I could only have a laptop with no iPad or this iPad keyboard case which is a bit more expensive but no laptop I really want to say I would rather have this I'd rather have like the ability to pop off and have an iPad at any time and then when I want to type I got the keyboard and I can go back and forth and it's much more fun it's a hundred twenty Hertz it's got way more apps there's cameras if I need them this is just more fun but I still need that laptop sometimes and for me that's especially when multitasking like if I'm writing the review on the keyboard and I have Spotify playing in the background and I just want to skip to the next song there's no button for it I have to go over into Spotify and then swipe and then come like have you ever tried to be on a zoom call and take notes at the same time in an iPad good luck it's not it doesn't work but all that being said in iPad land there are two types of people in this world those who get a case or a folio or a keyboard for their iPad and they keep it in it all the time they never take it out that's just the way the iPad is now or those who get a keyboard or case and pop it out and use it mostly like an iPad all the time and then sometimes they need to type so they'll pop it in here type away it becomes a typing machine then when they're done pop it back out use it as an iPad again for that second type of person this set up this accessory is the best possible version of the iPad this is a go this is awesome go for it spring the 300 bucks but for me I'm not getting rid of my laptop that's been it thanks for watching catchy has the next one peace
