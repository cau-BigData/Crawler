hey what's up guys I'm Kip EFT here and welcome back to dope tech I'm super into doing more of these especially for 2020 but while we're wrapping up 2019 let's just get right into it so dope Tech is for some of the most awesome incredible or just fun or interesting pieces of tech that I've discovered or bought or had an experience with that I think you're worth sharing and the first one that I'm going to share with you guys is this guy you might have seen it it's the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 it's the Star Wars Edition Note 10 might think I'm just into it because it's red and black and I not gonna lie this that's a part of why I'm into it but this is really a super legitimate Star Wars themed phone like we've seen a lot of special edition phones over the years and in fact I have a video coming up of a pretty wild special edition phone that's unlike anything I've ever seen before but this one really fully leans into the dark side of the Star Wars universe right from the unboxing experience so all leaves actually lose unboxing video linked in the description because he did a really good one and then when you get to the phone itself they really went next level there's a red ring around the camera and the buttons as you can see that's pretty basic but then you've got the logo of the first-order around the back and then in the software itself there's a dark theme it comes with a wallpaper of the red and black helmet and even the sounds the phone makes are all very Star Wars II now I typically mute my phone like as soon as I take it out the box I don't use the sounds but if you want to be this guy on the subway you can be this guy but really the cherry on top is the stylus the stylus is red like kylo Ren's lightsaber I think it looks pretty sick and now you can feel like some type of Jedi when you're using the air commands with the red lightsaber stylus and when you pull it out the phone every single time it's gonna make you feel like you're pulling out a lightsaber and putting it back so they really thought a lot about this I think a lot of people are going to see the movie right about now so this is something they've gotten really into but I'm just really excited for next year's potentially high refresh rate galaxy note 11 but that's beside the point the point is this is a special edition phone and I think they've done a really good job with it star wars edition note 10 all right next up color wear is finally shipping they're painted air pods pros so if you've watched the channel for a while you've known about color wear I've talked about them by how they precisely take apart repaint customize and put back together various electronics and new stuff as it comes out so as soon as the air pods pros got announced I immediately turn to them and I was like are you guys gonna do the thing where you paint the air pods pros and they said yep so now here they are and of course they'll do any color they have a bunch of colors on our site but I have to go with matte black everything here because I mean Who am I really matte black case here matte black earbuds and you know I'm just into making them really hard to find if I lose them so the things that aren't painted are the inside of the case which I don't think is that big of a deal and then the rubber tips on the earbuds of course which means you're gonna have this sort of contrast now between whatever color you paint the air pods and the actual rubber tips making them look that much more like a Pokemon now I'm gonna share a video in the description of someone who sort of did this themselves with air pods and plated them gold and surprisingly put them all back together and got them to be fully functional that is more of a super-fun artistic video that I think is worth checking out but it's just sort of impressive to admire that these still work the squeeze function and the tip still works the air channel passed through the impressive noise cancellation everything is just about how you'd expect just a new color I think really the main reason you have them painted is so that they look different in your ears the case is sort of a nice bonus so you can also get this painted so if you have more than one on a table you know which one's ear is immediately but yeah the look in your ears what you're doing it for so my ear pods pros are matte black now no regrets I'll make sure to link these and and everything else I talked about in this video in the description right below that like button okay next up is this guy so big shout out to Rene Richie for cluing me into this this was his favorite piece of tech in that big end-of-the-year collab we did for favorite tech of the year this is the oculus quest so this is a standalone VR headset so you might have seen something like the oculus rift which requires a PC to plug into or you might have seen something along of like slotting your phone into one where the phone does all the powering all the display this is sort of a happy medium in between those so this is the headset and you might have seen some others that look somewhat like it oh my god I'm in the world already but there's a couple different sensors built into the outside of it so there's no trackers that have to be placed around the room or the space you're in and the headset itself it's got the adjustable headband and everything about it gets you nice and snug as you'd expect and thankfully it charges via USB type-c it also has speakers built in and they're pretty close to your ears so you don't need headphones but what they've done is they tossed in some headphone jacks I want to say Jax I'm being plural it has two one on each side and so you can use your own headphones and get really immersed so I was playing these with noise cancelling headphones on top of the headset so that's like that next extra step to get really immersed in this world but the difference maker for this quest is since there's no trackers you can just get to an open area whatever room you want to be in set this thing up and you're just sort of free to move around in this world with this battery-powered headset on and the setup is actually really sick you put it on in an area that you're not configured in yet and the sensors on the outside light up and essentially give you this pass-through so now I can see the camera hi and lets you draw the space that you're in literally around you as like a safe zone they call it a guardian so once you've drawn that outline then you have that room to move around and it keeps track of it puts up the virtual walls calibrates the floor and you're set and then once you're into the gaming it is still really impressive to my eye well it's not perfect latency is still pretty low frame rates are high it does a pretty good job of filling my field of view and I was impressed with basically how well it stayed tracked and I'd never really noticed it losing positioning at all and I really like the controller's too so the ring around the the buttons they help you stay positioned and based on what buttons you're holding and what your fingers are doing the hands in the game will mimic like exactly what your hands are doing in real life down to the finger position so of course I had a great time playing some of my favorite VR games beat Sabre and super hot right at the top I would like the first ones I recommend for anyone trying to play these I'm gonna go ahead and try a bunch of new ones now that I have this since there's like 50 more titles in the oculus store but yeah you can just download the oculus app on your phone and then add them one by one to your library and try them out so that's what I'm gonna do but I got really into this I think this would be an incredible last-second gift for someone that you really really like so if you're still in that gift shopping mode I'll have a link below so of course big shout out to Rene for recommending this and a huge thanks to oculus for sponsoring this portion of the video ok last but certainly not least is this monster this is an 88 inch 8k OLED TV made by LG so as you can tell it's brand new we just got it in the studio and holy crap is it impressive so a couple quick facts number one it is the largest OLED display currently in production that you can actually buy right now at 88 inches diagonally and number two it's 8k which means it's 7680 across by 43 20 down which makes this total 33 million pixels that means this is a 33 mega pixel screen so there's already a lot of good-looking 4k displays in 4k OLED everywhere no doubt this is clearly next level but it's also not going to be maximized by pretty much anyone the current version of HDMI doesn't support 8k through a single cable there's almost no 8k content on TVs or on YouTube or Netflix or anything like that so getting something like this today for the 30 thousand dollars that it costs definitely makes it more of a high-end statement piece but also like clearly bleeding edge but even knowing all that it's still really impressive to look at because number one it's huge I think even an 88 inch 4k OLED will look incredible but it's just a massive panel but then also number two while we're sort of waiting for all this 8k stuff this thing is gonna do its best to upscale and make sub 8k content look better if you go on LG's website to see how this works it's not super scientific or explanatory you know there's some obvious processing involved they have two diagrams with two levels of enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance but what matters at the end is the results and these speak for themselves and obviously you're watching this through my camera and then through youtube processing and then through your screen so there's almost no way you can fully appreciate what we're looking at here but even through all that I feel like you can get the idea that the brightness and the contrast and the colors and just the sheer size and resolution of this TV are on another level it costs as much as a car you know but for people who are into tech they might just want this more than a car and that's what makes it dope tech this is only the second 8k display that's ever been in the studio the first one was that Dell 8k monitor from a while back which was the first one that I could ever see the 8k footage we shoot on an a case screen and that was incredible but I mean an 88 inch screen is just different a lot of the same funny quirks happened here too if you plug in the 8k display into a computer and try to game at 8k scaling can be weird with some games and most graphics cards will refuse to cooperate but it's still gonna look great upscale high-resolution thanks to LG's tech and I am very impressed that I can actually tell the difference so there you have it all I know is this is gonna make an incredible first piece of tech to move into the new studio space that we're planning for early 2020 and that is really exciting but I think every dope tech piece on this list earns its spot here for its own reason so that's been it thanks for watching this episode on word with tech cember catch you guys in the next one peace
