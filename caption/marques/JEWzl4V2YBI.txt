[Music] hey what's up guys and kid Bhd here back with the one plus seven pro arguably the phone of the year so far and i'm not the only one who thinks that so usually when a phone first comes out i get to do an impressions video of what i first think about it when it gets released and we talk about it in the comments for a little bit and we figure out what people are mostly curious about for the full review and then i do a review but of course with the 1 plus 7 pro that wasn't the case i had just a couple weeks to use it and then went straight into a full review so now after that there's been a couple things have bubbled up and there's some interesting tidbits that were left out that weren't in the full review or updates to it that i still think are pretty interesting so this video is all the little things you might still not know about the 1 plus 7 pro even after the review and some clarification on things that were in it so first about being waterproof so the 1 plus 7 pro isn't technically IP certified but they have also made this point to pretty much tell everyone their phones are safe being splashed on dave CD did his entire review video with the phone totally under water in a bowl next to him and took it out at the end and it was fine basically getting a phone officially IP certified means adding all the rubber and the seals internally and then going through independent testing that cost extra money so oneplus has made it a point to still go through the same diligence to add all the rubber and the seals but not pay for the independent testing and just pass along those savings to us i could only assume that they've done some sort of internal testing on their own which gives them this confidence that they can tell people you can splash water on it or go out on the rain i don't know how much per unit this actually saved us buyers i've heard numbers ranging from 10 bucks to 30 bucks per unit which sounds like a lot to me but bottom line is I'm ok with it as long as the third-party testing we're now seeing by people like Dave seems to show this will hold up fine and then for those wondering about RAM since there are a couple different specs you can get of the 7 Pro with either 6 8 or 12 gigs of ram so you can check out this page in oxygen OS where it shows my average ram usage with my medium to heavy use I'm averaging around 5 gigs of memory used so technically I'd be fine with 6 a ram but I think I'd go ahead and upgrade to eight just to be safe one plus only charges thirty extra dollars to do that so $6.99 and you give yourself a little Headroom the twelve gigs of ram is a bit more about future proofing and taking advantage of one pluses ram boost feature where it preloads some parts of apps into the ram so it can open them even faster but that's you know bordering on overkill I love it but you'll only really notice it at the crazy high end of using the phone and then there's still no G cam app or Google cam report for the one plus seven Pro yet still cross my fingers for it side note I don't know how exactly it's gonna work with multiple cameras since all of Google's phones only have one camera could be interesting to see what that ends up looking like anyway the stock camera app also has some things to note number one in the settings you can turn on or off ultra wide-angle correction by default it's on and I think most people will like it this way it minimizes distortion around the edges but if you turn it off this Nets you a bit of a more distorted GoPro like look that you might be into so if you want to turn that off the choice is yours then too you can actually choose which photo modes show up in the slider along the bottom and in what order so if you take a lot of nightscape shots or if you use Pro Mode a lot you can just move those up to be a slide away all the time or remove the ones you don't use so that's a nice customization that actually wish stock Android had or iPhones head and then you cannot record video from the ultra wide camera you can from the regular camera or even the telephoto but not from the ultra wide like LG and Huawei let you that is disappointing to me I asked oneplus about it they told me officially they do not have plans to support video from the wide-angle camera that's what they said okay another note people were asking a lot about the speed of the retracting selfie camera so what's cool is if this little pop-up selfie camera is out and the phone detects some sort of freefall it automatically retracts into the phone so in case it lands somewhere around there it'll prevent damage that's smart so i roughly timed how long it takes the motor to open and close since it's not instant and it seems to take somewhere around half a second to actually go from fully out to retracted a freefall in that time is somewhere around 1.2 meters or 4 feet for any object including this phone so that means if you're at like selfie normal height and you drop it from 5 feet it will be fully retracted by the time it hits the ground but if you're just dropping it on a counter or just like from pocket height and it's not quite four feet there's a chance it will still actually not be done retracting by the time it hits the ground but honestly I still think half way retracted is still better than fully exposed if it happens to land on it so I still think this feature is useful and a lot of cool videos came out of it too alright so there's some other feature is an oxygen OS that I'd want to see in some other skins so this applies to more than just the 1 plus 7 Pro but a bunch of one-plus phones that includes the ability to change the accent color of the entire OS to literally any color you want that's pretty dope being able to hide any of the icons up in the top and the status bar if you don't want them to be there I mentioned that in the full review I still love that I can do that and then also this little animation for stuff in the quick settings like turning on and off airplane mode it's a really nice subtle touch a couple other roms also do this and then since it's such a big phone the ability to swipe down anywhere and get notifications or swipe up anywhere in the launcher to get the app drawer you can do this with third-party launchers but of course being in a stock launcher that's convenient too I've seen this before and I'm happy to have it here on such a big phone and then I've got some clarifications from the full review so first on refresh rate I think I mentioned in the full review that it was locked at 90 Hertz technically technically this is actually already variable refresh rate so the 1 plus 7 Pro display is always locked at 90 Hertz unless you are watching a video in the camera app or on a phone call in which case it'll go down to 60 Hertz so that's what I heard from one plus officially those are the times it goes down so that makes sense you don't need 90 Hertz on a phone call or even when you're watching a 30fps video or in the camera app where you're not doing 90 fps those are the good times for it to throttle down but even still if you're just on the home screen or if you're just sitting reading an article and not moving the screen too much it's still refresh rate locked at 90 Hertz so that's still gonna be eating through some battery life so it says sort of a middle-level compromise and there's still a possibility of a software update coming to improve those times where it can be refreshed variably more often and then speaking of battery a lot of people didn't like my assessment of the four to four and a half hours of screen on time I was getting on the oneplus 7 pro you know some other reviewers are getting 6-7 hours but that screen on time metric that I used it's extremely relative and specific to your usage style you can't really just directly compare one person's screen on time to another person's screen on time because these people don't use the same apps or the same accessories or the same brightness even I haven't or ously had a very taxing way of using my phones you know high brightness all the time bluetooth always on NFC oh is on a lot of GPS navigation multitasking often so you can compare my four and a half hours of screen on time on this phone with my screen on time across other devices that used the same way which will range between like three hours on the worst ones to the six to seven hours of the chimp the p30 pro so that being said the battery life on my one plus seven pro it's actually slowly slowly gotten more consistent and slightly better over the weeks I've used it but it's still not amazing since I leave ninety Hertz on and it's a 1440p display max brightness but I haven't gotten past five hours of screen on time on a day just quite yet it's not terrible by any means but you know fast charging usually saves the day for me most of the time and then lastly there is a one plus seven coming it's just not coming to the US so there's a one plus seven pro we all know this starts at six sixty nine the one plus seven will be you know essentially a revised version of the one plus sixty the teardrop notch a 1080p AMOLED 60 Hertz but just with internal specs bumped up snapdragon a 55 that type of thing I kind of still wish that was coming to the u.s. at a lower price that would have been pretty exciting but I also pulley understand oneplus is pricing strategy here maybe I'll try to get my hands on the standard one plus seven anyway maybe let me know in the comments if that's something you'd be into honestly though the price of the oneplus 7 pro is still kind of amazing though like if you imagine this from any other company imagine for a second Samsung comes out with a special edition Galaxy S 10 plus right now some new colorway or something and they give it a no hole punch at 90 Hertz display and 12 gigs of ram like you could easily see that phone being a thousand plus dollars right but because it's one plus we had a certain set of expectations for it and I still would say it delivered anyway I hope this video clears many questions people had about the 1 plus 7 Pro or gives you some extra information I'll leave the link to the full review below again if you're interested in watching that but this has been distracting me so much from pixel 3a and this new zenfone that came out with the swiveling screen and everything so videos on those are now upcoming thanks to this one being done alright thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
