[Music] hey what's up guys MP PhD here and it's 2019 and obviously everything leaks so of course it's never too early for a little bit of pixel hype and boys today a good day for some of that so if you've been following pixel 3 for the past couple months you know I'm comparing it to other phones we've been asking Google for so long now to step up their hardware game to match their incredible software that's always been like a slightly weaker point with the pixels and it looks like they finally done it for 2019 so this is your exclusive first look at the Google pixel for for 2019 there it is that's the phone okay so there's a lot to take in here of course things like why does it look so different why does it have that wedge looking thing why is it like it's in a case but luckily not only do I have this leak but I also have a bunch of information I have some sources some exclusives so I can explain it all so my sources are close to the situation but they wish to remain anonymous but I'd trust him with my life they're a hundred percent on this kind of stuff and I have the answers first of all these leaked images come as a picture of the phone with a clear case on it so that's why it might look kind of weird with that sort of an outline but that's what's happening you can clearly see the outline of a cleared case around the pixel for and they're really going bezel lists like the rest of the competition the chin is of course tiny side bezels minimal and there's a fingerprint reader now underneath the display glass on the front and as you can see the screen goes right all the way up to the top and then there's a motorized selfie camera shelf that looks like a shark fin and as a matter of fact that is the device's internal code name so it's pretty common before a phone comes out for it to have an internal name that everyone the employees refer to it as an internal code name and Google's for the past couple years with pixels and Nexus devices have notoriously been fish related so the Nexus 7 tablet before came out was internally referred to as grouper and then the Nexus 10 the bigger tablet before that came out that was called Manta like a manta ray the Nexus 4 was called Mako as in mako shark Nexus 5 was hammerhead and then Nexus 6 was infamously Shamu so the whale and then the first pixel was called sailfish so Google's clue is sticking to those roots with pixel for internal codename shark-fin because of the shark fin selfie camera obviously it also looks like Google's doing a dual camera on the back which is nice I'm thinking that's an ultra wide camera because you can't really fake ultra wide with software like Google's done a whole bunch of great stuff with one camera in the past but you can't do ultra wide if you don't have an old tried lens so a second camera super ultra wide lens that's great and then my source says that should have the latest specs snapdragon 855 eight gigs of ram great and then the power button and volume rocker are in the same traditional place the squeeze functionality is also still intact so why was Google able to suddenly step up their hardware game so fast for this pixel for and why does this remind me of that leak I just saw last week of that Oppo Reno phone while my source says Google recently completed a silent acquisition of the mobile hardware team at Oppo this is totally exclusive never-before-seen information so that's why the pixel 4 looks exactly like that Oppo Reno leaked that we saw last week and actually believe this is an intentional leak take another closer look at this Apple image so at first it looks like a random collection of colorful art see images nothing to see here but why else will they have a magnifying glass and a microscope clearly they want us to look closer here so if you look even closer so there's a whale over there and that's an obvious hint at the sea life in all their previous code names and there's a camera over there all the way over to the side that's clearly a signal at how proud Google is of the cameras and it's a DSLR with a wide-angle lens on it meaning it'll have the ultra wide camera as that second lens confirm and then what is this like around the plants like some sort of plant like a like a beanstalk like Jack and the Beanstalk okay okay so that's how okay that's how you tell us we're getting a pixel for it with a jack a headphone jack well played Google well played and then there's some sort of monkey or lemur which I wasn't sure what species it was supposed to be until I saw it the elephant which is clearly an African elephant which if it wasn't obvious by the globe hanging down that shows Africa I mean come on guys so of course I looked up the species of lemurs that are native to Africa turns out this one most closely resembles a red-tailed sportive lemur native to Madagascar fun fact and red-tailed clearly means that they want the letter under the tail to be read so we can turn that e red and then above the letter n is clearly a magnifying glass on the color yellow so they want the letter under that magnifying glass to be yellow duh so you turn that yellow which gives you the four colors of the letters now blue red yellow blue are you getting it you reminds you of anything blue red yellow blue okay so last bit I think they just do this in for fun for the people who didn't get all of that they just called it the Oppo Reno pretty obvious Reno backwards is owner as in owner as in first project under a new owner Google so easy so clearly this is the pixel for confirmed in every which way but that's not all we've also been waiting for well over a year for an additional device and we're finally getting it there is also a pixel for ultra so this is a clip of the pixel for ultra launching alongside this phone courtesy of our guide Dave 2d [Music] it's just beautiful it's so beautiful so yeah clearly leaks are getting pretty serious in the tech world mean you gotta look you got to look a little deeper than just the surface level when you see a leak this is how you get to the next level I even tossed it in an OCR program and I saw those characters in between oppo and Reno and of course we know oppo is or was a Chinese company so I translated the OCR image into characters in English and I got April Fool nice so this is your annual reminder not to take any announcements or any new products too seriously for the next 24 hours but I hope you enjoyed this one anyway but what isn't a joke is the new drop in the mkbhd merge store including this and a bunch of all favorites are coming back including this new thing a matte black microfiber I was kind of getting tired of those like thin ones they just kind of toss in everything the microfiber is you see everywhere so this is a high-quality one you can actually use on everything laptop phone tablet just want to kill them all thanks Bigsby so I'll link to everything below also shout out to Dave to D for helping out with this video and his glorious beautiful pixel 3 or pixel 4 mock-up appreciate that Dave anyway until the next one happy April Fool's Day thanks for watching catch you guys next one bass
