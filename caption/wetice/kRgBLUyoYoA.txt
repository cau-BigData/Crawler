different place right now right we are like a different background than me because basically I've changed it uploaded right so this is going to be where i'm going to show you a little more of my setup because i just my some my stuff came and it's super great stuff I can tell you maybe you see it maybe you don't maybe something new on my set up right you see that I have LED lights so I am basically an LED light strip all over like on me you know just on the wall even behind my set up and everything so it's beautiful right that's that's what I enjoy the most now as you can see it moving my laptop you see now hold on let me take you with me ok so I've been talking about this over here as you can see i move the laptop from in here up here because I ordered a docking station was going to make my life easier not have being you know annoying but plugging all of these cables those cables are just plain annoying so I've been speaking about these LED strips down here you can see it's going all the way there right all the way goes over there right now these LED strips are just amazing i love them love them there are just the best so i just want to show you a little bit ok let me just shut down the stupid light here now he's gonna get a little darker but yes this is what I've been talking about now you can see that are you my main screen you know because I don't need it right now but you know the room looks a lot kind of roomier right now when I don't have the big screen over here a lot nicer I believe and yeah let me just show you so L it is one number two is I've been just so lazy on turning the lights on right look I have these three remotes here right 120 oh my god this is the remote for we just turn the lights on soon this is the remote for my colors this is the remote for what I'm going to show you now my lights so I've been so lazy i push on oh god damn it there's so much light so let me just show you okay I have this remote what turns on my lights right this is like a simple remote on and off very good remote and then we have this color remote right so I can you know on my my lights that can just make them lower and all that so this is this remote that works all of that perfect okay and then this remote now look at this okay genius like the brand and just just you know think a little bit about it you know think a tiny weeny bit about about that and pause the video and now i'm going to tell you what it is so i've ordered something a long time ago it's this genius set up of speakers of stereo in my room it's amazing you know you want to hear something yeah of course you want so let me just explain it has three channels okay it has look at that it has which is the DVD no fortunately it is TV aux1 and aux too so essentially i can plug for devices into it so obviously remember how well speaking about my setup that I at the cable like dangling down here you know remember that and those cables where knowing me so I removed them and now I have all of them plugged into the main system so that's pretty much very very good and I enjoy that so then i have this computer plug and laptop plug and you can see that on top here there is a cable where i can plug my phone to put music so that's what I view that oh my god should phone you know so that's only he's got a big y hi oh no no okay shut down phone so let me just continue so I have all these plug and I can plug my phone and i have it set up like that my phone basically is the TV one and this is computer my laptop and the editing computer and all of this i can do via the remote right so as you can see i have many buttons here like the reset button then the volume button then what i have the woofer button oh oh my god the woofer button or basically can change the bass and all the settings for different speakers right and then over here I can change the channel so that remote essentially have has everything that this main thing has right so I don't even have to I have a remote my life is easier now let me just show you the sound so yeah first I want speaker here right this speaker here then I have one speaker behind over there can you can see it no it wants to collect there is one speaker right over here right and there's the middle speaker there and one more speaker here now there's a bunch of junk over there but there are the speakers now let me just sit on my chair and I have my list of the music it used for editing right so let me just you know turn the volume down a little bit I probably not going to hear the best effect of it but let's just put like a song and
