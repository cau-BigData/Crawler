[Music] because we arrived to a nice spot here where there's a restaurant right across the street so it's very nice actually looks quite interesting as a restaurant it's overlooking this view with the bridge over here the sea here or whatever yes I think that's it and yeah let's just have lunch out of the restaurant good actually it's a bar sabab it was a kind of good food we had anyway like a sandwich so that's a good place for that it took days what I'll show you the sign in the next clip but good food [Music] oh nothing to my bones Phil knock at door dogs buddy more I don't understand myself Oh to meet with everybody now see there's something going on I don't understand why so cold enough just to my bones Phil's ICAP don't talk anymore to meet with every girl you paid off eh ah understand why you so all well we put away point somewhere on the GPS and it's taking us through some kind of forest road that our 40 is barely the kind of capable of following but we're following the GPS like GPS normally have to take us a good way it shortest way or something but we're kind of in the forest with not a 4x4 car so that's that's kind of fun right it's shaking but hopefully this is not the only way to go to our our hotel because that's an interesting video tell me how did you guess [Music] are you so close chose not hold it off for you only to see you wanna off anymore well the GPS probably took us through a shortcut or something because that was funny going through the forest yeah I would avoid that kind of route because little it was crazy to go that way but we uh we arrived through the galley of Lorne in that's some kind of hotel whatever thing so this is where we're going to be now we're going to go look like there's Wi-Fi because that's quite important since there was no Wi-Fi in hope two of our hotels so x1 here we go we went to the room we looked at it very nice room perfect size the Wi-Fi works perfectly so I'll probably be even able to upload my video that's the good thing now let's go to give you a little bit further and get some more [Music] understand lives we just pretty much found the end of the world because behind us there's nothing else this is completed a tip and and there's nothing no more it's just beautiful it's so quiet around here there's just the sound of the sea and the sound of birds here we go arrived at the room beautiful room nice place no problem except I'm having problems with the Wi-Fi I just hate I just want to go home because of the Wi-Fi I just want to I just want to be here but have the Wi-Fi have home it's it's horrible did you get [Music]
