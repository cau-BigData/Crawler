hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at these these are the air pods Pro I just got them here I have the air pods one the original air pause I skipped the whole to the second version one but these are really going to be way more interesting than these over here so first of all they're already thicker and they seem to be a lot bigger than these so unboxings with Apple are pretty straightforward we're just gonna peel this off right here that's a different way of opening up something okay and then it just breaks so then we just apparently twelve you just take off everything and then we've got the box so there's this really nice thing on the back which really tells you like how they actually look so it's a really longer case for them than in the past that's really really cool and different anyway let's put them down turn them so that you can see them and let's take the cover off okay it's need some little help okay here we go so of course designed by Apple in California some paper work so that's nothing really important to your airports Pro paper work and stuff well and this is what it is so here they are this is the whole case I expected it to be a little bit bigger to be honest but it's quite cool alright let's move this to the side and let's just open them up right there we go okay so here they are this is the whole air pods Pro box so if we compare them to the previous like the first generation as you can see they're quite different so air pods pro here and air pods one here there's quite a difference right so now let me just look inside so as you can see they're just sitting inside and they're sitting inside differently than these so if you look at these they are just sitting like this and if you look at these they're just sitting in a different way which is kind of interesting as well so I've got one out as you can see this is the hole all air pod nothing really really special it's a little different it's more curved and of course it has this earpiece which is gonna make it so that it's it's way better in your ears now this is kind of weird how it goes back in but I guess that's kind of like what you didn't use to but it's kind of weird how it goes back in so they give you some extra ear pieces this just plops off like this pretty much and here it contains like two different types so like the ones that are already on it plus the two extra that are here and then you've got your USB c2 lightning cable which is right here which I think they're starting to give with everything which is really really weird what they're doing anyway so that's the whole unboxing here of these cool cool air pods so of course you can charge them on the bottom or you can use any wireless charger that you buy somewhere else so that's really cool so this is already the wireless charging case built in so now let's try to pair it with my phone normally it should be pretty straightforward you just pretty much open them up and normally this should recognize oh I have to update let's set up with limited functionality so what it does is you can now select announce messages with Siri that's a new thing that we have in iOS 13 so you say announced messages with Siri air Potts pro Don normally should be connected now and then once they're connected you can just easily see that if you go here long press this press this right over here and you can see that you have the airport's Pro here and once you take him out it should connect automatically or you can just select that and now it should be playing on the air pods Pro and you can now also share the audio but beware for example for me it gave me a message that I have to update my phone because there's limited functionality so just go ahead update your phone and then they should work better well then this concludes this video of opening up these cool air pod let's try them out so this is the left one oh my god it fits so much better and now I just want to try the noise cancellation how that works Oh my god this is like normally you hold or something like that no the noise-canceling is like whoa like I barely hear myself now so let me just play up just play a song I cannot hear what I'm saying the noise cancellation is so good I hope the audio is not loud okay so the noise cancellation is amazing these things are so so so cool Wow all right well this concludes this unboxing and a little bit of a setup it's super easy to setup if you have the correct software of course you can use this with some different versions of iOS but the functionality will be limited so if you want to get everything out of them you should update to the latest software updates so 13.2 and then just be great with it it's gonna be awesome they're super cool I am really excited to have gotten them and then the the default size fits me quite well but if you have bigger ears or smaller ears you can take advantage of these two things here and you can just change them out for bigger or smaller ones which is great okay NORs cancellation the transparency mode works really well I am super happy with these this is amazing Wow alright guys so thank you
