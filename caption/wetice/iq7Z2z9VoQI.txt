what's up guys here I have the new iPhone se in the shell of an iPhone 8 with the processing power of an iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro and all this for $399 there are really many aspects that you will love and that will make this iPhone sell really really fast so yes basically it is an iPhone 8 but with so many improvements that make it so much better especially if you look that not many people are wanting to spend over $1,000 for a new phone but rather the $400 further paying half for a good size phone with excellent performance which will last for a few years this iPhone already has so much going for it so let's dive right in the shell is an iPhone 8 with the all glass back that supports wireless charging stereo speakers and it is ip67 watch or resistant so you can literally drop it into 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes it also features a single lens camera that is said to be the best single lens camera in and iPhone up to date and you can choose from white red and black colors as well as storage options from 64 gigabytes all the way to 256 so of course with the iPhone you are getting more screen real estate going from the original se touch ID remains and you still have the thick bezels which in comparison to the iPhone 11 look a little bit oldish but it has the original iPhone design of course many people will miss the headphone jack that is now officially gone so on the outside it is almost identical to the iPhone 8 with a few changes here and there but it is on the inside where there are the most changes you are getting the a 13 Bionic chip which is the same one you get in the iPhone 11 lineup which already can cost you up to three times more when using the iPhone it feels almost the same as when using my daily device the iPhone 11 Pro because of its same 60 Hertz refresh rate and of course the a 13 another great thing you get the latest software version which is Iowa's 13.4 also it is great going back to a device that you can hold with just one hand and reach all the way to the top but I think that the price isn't the only thing making this device worth it it's also the camera the pictures compare to die for 11pro aren't that different but the colors are in the same either and you are also able to shoot videos up to 4k 60 frames per second and surprisingly enough there isn't that much difference between the two phones both cameras use smart HDR and you're able to use the portrait mode which is something you didn't have on the original s II however what is expected the detail in the pictures is not as high you also miss out on the ultra wide and telephoto lens but to be honest if you are just using the camera to make memories then it's perfectly fine you also don't get night mode which is something that I thought would be here in comparison to the iPhone 11 Pro both of these can do 4k 60 frames per second except the iPhone 11 Pro seems to be handling the light better but as you can see the audio this is how it sounds on the SE and this is how it sounds over on the iPhone 11 Pro max now on the flip end the iPhone se 2 can only do 1080p with the front camera while this one can do 4k on the front so as you can see there's a little bit of a difference but both seem to be doing quite good in video and the sound is about the same so audio wise about the same but picture wise I really prefer the iPhone 11 Pro but of course the SE has only 1080p the battery life will probably be a little lower than on the iPhone 11 pro max for example but it will be quite good nonetheless so of course it has a small battery size but the screen size the lower resolution and the maximum brightness will all make the battery life good enough while very likely lasting the whole day of course depending on your usage this iPhone is probably the for the price you can find out there but of course you are able to find cheaper Android phones as well however when looking for an iPhone this is probably the best way to go for this value you are getting the a13 processor a better camera the latest updates for a few years to come better battery life and all this for $400 many people I know still have the original SE so this iPhone will definitely be the way to go for so many people out there now let's take the bad side in 2020 not many people still have huge bezels because all screen displays are really becoming the norm nowadays so if you really want an iPhone for a good value then I have to strongly recommend this one it has everything you really need with so many upgrades coming from anything below the iPhone 8 now what do you
