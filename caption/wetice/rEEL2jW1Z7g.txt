hello everyone and welcome back to another video nine-to-five mag just post the report by Ming Chico highlighting all the products we should be seeing in 2020 some of them were reported dead a couple months back and now they are back air power was cancelled due to some issues but now Ming Chico is saying that it will be back but in a smaller size we could be seeing air power in the first half of 2020 alongside the 13-inch MacBook Pro new pro headphones Apple style trackers the iPhone se 2 and a new iPad pro well that's a lot in one day now let's break down all of these Apple will be entering into three new branches of the market that they never have before they will come with new headphones marketed as Apple headphones with no cooperation with Beats they'll come with Bluetooth trackers to track things you want and an Apple branded wireless charging mat let's start with the headphones bloomberg reported in I think June or July of 2018 that high-end over ear headphones would be coming later these headphones would be high quality with incredible sound for studio work of course their price tag would be around three hundred to five hundred dollars similar to the highest end beats they would be Wireless of course and would be coming in the first half of 2020 we don't know much about what the specs could be but we could guess that they would work via bluetooth they would have noise cancellation and features similar to the air plants pro but who knows maybe we'll be in for a surprise what about air power well no one is calling it air power yet but it just makes me so happy to have it back for those that don't know air power was originally designed to charge your iPhone your watch and your air pods all at the same time it was canceled because Apple run into some issues with overheating that could potentially damage your devices and therefore they stopped it entirely of course we don't have the technology for the idea that Apple had but we might be seeing something similar to this it could charge your phone and your airports or your phone and your watch the technology today allows for that so it would be no surprise if Apple couldn't make this was the original design of air power what is even more surprising is the potential release date it could be coming in the first half of this year which is actually really soon Apple tau tracking devices have been rumored to be released for quite some time now you'll be able to play a sound to locate it but you also might be able to use augmented reality to use your camera to find it when it'll be found it would show a red balloon over it and you would be able to find them if it won't be in your close proximity then it will most likely use the worldwide Apple ecosystem to anonymously ping your device now that's really incredible the 13-inch MacBook Pro is also in the works and as some sources say it might become a 14 inch if Apple makes the bezels thinner the key feature here will be the upgraded keyboard that we have already seen on the 16 inch macbook pro that came out this year you might have heard that the keyboard was horrendous on the past MacBooks so Apple is trying to fix this across all of their mac books of course the next device for the first half of 2020 is the iPhone se also referred to as the iPhone 9 it will have a 4.7 inch LCD screen and will look similar to the iPhone 8 it will have the new a 13 processor and have a low price as well but of course we have seen a ton of leaks about this phone so it's just a matter of time when we will see it finally the iPad pro it was originally supposed to be released in 2019 but Apple decided to delay it to early 2020 it will have upgraded specs in a triple camera setup and the design will remain the same of the previous iPad pros and it is also rumored to be similar to the design of the coming iPhone 12 still I don't understand the usefulness of a triple camera but oh well it should also have the time of flight camera that is rumored to come on the iPhone 12 but let's see about that word of course 5g is on the way but we don't know if it will come for the iPad Pro this year or next year all these devices should be coming in the next five months which just adds to my excitement out of all this I can really just guess that we will see an incredible March event filled with all the products well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed then please do leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously you really can't imagine how much also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here and watch it thank you take care and I'll see you in my next video
