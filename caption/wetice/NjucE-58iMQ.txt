hey guys and welcome back to a new video today so I've had this phone for a week now and I thought that like why not do kind of like one week with or something along those lines to say something about it so the first thing that was a big change for me from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone X series is face ID so face ID has been a change because it's just a whole different way but it's it's like working it's super fast it's super great I have no complaints about it but it's just something to adjust and then also in the ik c Riis you have this gestures mode whatever there's no home button so everything is with gestures and it's not like you press the button you swipe up so that's another big change that I saw here is face ID first of all which I'm impressed that it even works at night second is the gestures which I mean I like them but it took me about a week to kind of get used to them and and to just be happy with how it works I mean everything else is just kind of the same it's just a lot faster the camera is super like it's great even in the portrait mode that can be now even selfie which is super good like I really enjoy it so like the portrait mode even I enjoyed so much it's super great super cool I really enjoy how it works the camera makes beautiful pictures I'm just in love with the phone actually I'm just happy that it's new and and it's great and also I really got used to the the knotch which many people were complaining about like the notch that's up here but it's not so bothering I guess because when you're in full screen it doesn't even really it's not really noticeable for me I guess and and it's just I like it honestly I don't really mind the knotch which was very annoying for some people but I like it and well that's pretty much I think everything from here oh yeah the animal jeez that's kind of cool I don't use it really often but I guess it's it's kind of cool and well honestly I just had a very good experience with the phone over the first week I'll probably update you a little bit later to see if I found something else or if something else is just going terrible so also also by the way yeah the speakers are really cool loud and and the microphone is also quite good so it's just a really cool good phone and even since it's a little bit smaller than the iPhone eight but it's like the size of the display - the kind of the edges where the home button was it's really a pleasurable experience to have such a good sized phone like I really enjoy the 5.8 inch it's like a really a good sized phone compared to the huge iPhone 8 but like before either you had the iPhone 8 which was like small and then you had the iPhone ik+ which I had which was like six point one inches or something like that so it's just nice to have a little bit of a smaller phone I really enjoy it and the max would be for sure too big for me and the 6.1 inch XR I don't know I just this one I find it to be the perfect middle middle man let's say so it's it's cool anyway but this is gonna wrap it up so the verdict is I enjoy it I recommend this phone if you want to buy an X I mean if you have an X just keep the X but like if you're upgrading from an 8 or 7 or 6 go to the iPhone XS like you have a really cool processor you have a really cool camera you have a really cool new features so that's pretty much it so I enjoy all of it I hope I will continue enjoying all of it and I hope this kind of variety video like I just talked about something if you did leave a like subscribe and ring the little bell there that's really important as well you're gonna get notifications when I post the video okay take care I'll see you next time bye
