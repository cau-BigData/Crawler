hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at the p30 pro by huawei incredible phone by the way hope you enjoyed many of the videos that we're coming but today I'd like to touch on the topic of night photography now previously I made a mistake of not going into night mode but this time all the pictures I take in night mode on the May 20 X on the P 30 Pro except iPhone XS doesn't have a night mode but we're comparing these three phones I'm really excited so now we're gonna take a look I took pictures from sunset darker and super night dark right now let's take a look at the first three pictures as you can see on the iPhone they're quite dark white on the May 20x they are kind of good really good and compared to the p30 there's not much of a difference there's a little bit more light on the p30 but they seem quite well and they work quite well together and they seem to be the same now if we go a little bit lower right so we are already going towards the end of sunset we can see that the iPhone access is already really kind of trying to suffer right and then the May 20 X is already darker than the P 30 Pro the P 30 Pro is still light like really light and now finally we're gonna take a look at full dark it was super super super dark like I could not even see what the phones are right so iPhone X s dark you can only see light from the window nothing else the May 20x you can still see stuff but it's all kind of dark and then the P 30 Pro incredible image it's like daytime image during the night of course the quality suffers a little bit but overall I find that the quality is not bad at all for what it is it's incredible so looking at that picture it's super light it's super light I am impressed how it captured so much detail in such darkness so also if you go into night mode that's where you have to be to take these pictures if you just go into the regular mode then it's not gonna take such an amazing picture it's gonna be kind of similar to the iPhone XS which is the mistake I made previously because I shot it in normal mode and not in night mode so beware of that you really have to switch to night mode to see the full capacity of the night camera anyway a resolution wise the iPhone dead the iPhone extending the May 20x kind of getting grainy right but then the p30 Pro it's in sane I'd love to know what you think about these three images which one you like most maybe the p30 pros image is too bright and it kind of doesn't look natural at night maybe you prefer the may 20x or maybe you prefer the completely dark picture which maybe you do so leave that in the comments down below I'd love to hear about that if you have any more tips on how to take better pictures maybe like other things like that please post them in the comments down below also if you have any questions whatsoever about taking pictures in nighttime with the p30 pro or the May 20x I'll be more than happy to answer well this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed this super cool phone review night photography type of thing if you did please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this on this phone a comprehensive review is coming very very soon also if you missed out in my previous video then please click the card shown in the right corner up here can check out the previous video to the Huawei okay take care and I'll see in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
