hello guys welcome back to another video today iOS 12.1 point 3 beta 4 has been released and I would like to answer the question of should you upgrade is something new should you not upgrade let's see let's talk about all that now just a few days after I was 12 point 1 point 3 beta 3 beta 4 came which is super interesting because now we can see that Apple is actually getting back into the game of publishing all these new updates very regularly so it seems to be a big update for some people for me it's about a 1.8 gigabytes which is like ok but for some it can be just like a hundred megabyte update so nothing really big now we should be seeing the final release of iOS 204 1.3 next week ish or so but more about that at the end of the video so what's new well the modem firmware was updated which should solve many of the people's issues of cellular connectivity which many people were reporting in I was to open 1 2 1 2 3 and all the way till now well this is updated now so you should for sure update if you have connectivity issues and it'll be a lot better for you because probably your issues will be fixed now scrolling seems to be different that has been reported by some people but that may be due to the lawsuit with Qualcomm which probably happened and now the scrolling is a little bit different but I cannot really see anything but let me know if you can really notice some difference when you're scrolling down the page settings don't freeze so usually in the past if you deleted a default app it would kind of like freeze your settings but that is reported to not happen anymore which is great please you don't have bugs like that that just make everything miserable and your life miserable as well but that great performance and battery life are pretty much the same for the past two updates meaning that since Iowa stuff put 1.2 battery life was kind of crap ish and now it's not really different or anything so we are still with the same performance same battery life which is not very good but hopefully we're going to see some more things happening in the final release of this or in 12.1 12.2 but anyway expect the final release to be in about a week or two weeks or so but in a very short period of time not too long from now and hopefully we're gonna get to a point to afterwards and some releases of 12.2 which will hopefully bring some more features than we've been seeing in the 12.1 series now do I think you should update yes for sure update if you have any issues if you have crashing settings freezing settings and if your modem firmware and like your cellular activity is just like crap then you should for sure update but anyway stay tuned until I always talk 11.2 and further on and just let's wait until that for more amazing features and hopefully some more fixes anyway this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it's greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time okay bye [Music] [Music]
