hey guys and welcome back for a brand new video so today is another beautiful day summer is coming soon and it's coming closer and closer while I'm recording another video today we're going to look at some hilarious DIY fails this is going to be funny I just roughly looked through them and I laugh a little bit so we're gonna look at those and you should tell me what you think in the comment section down below y'all need to use for watch your ball so when it's empty just stick it on a hose in your shower place and make holes on the bottom of the bottle and then you have a shower head pretty much so it works like that it's a very simple design you can shower easily that way and you'll be fine if you need some real surround sound just do how this guy did because he just put two speakers on his ears takes it around his head with scotch tape probably and now he has used a round sound how about that that's very very smart idea you can do that normally the four speakers just put two speakers runnn exterior hop-step hole ha you keep everything with a wooden stick so there's a table on the bottom chair then there's some breaks on the chair and then there's a wooden stick keeping your conditioner in place so yeah that's really unnecessary you could just put this bowl or something but I guess you had to move all your furniture out there something this was not a very smart idea from you because uh now you don't have your chair and your table ah oh so your fall set breaks so you just put a straw and as long it were and the as long as it works it's fine just put a shop it pours water wherever you need it do you can like even bend it so you can put the water wherever you want and you're fine you have a makeshift hoppin thing yeah I really want to know how that works this is especially for girls where basically they will decide their ponytail if they don't have like a rubber band or something so just take this big block no this locks this plastic I don't remember the name this thing and the just tied around your hair but that's like yeah it's going to be you're gonna have a hard time picking it up that's for sure don't get the fun just get the fat from Tesco or somewhere and tie it around with some blue tape around the computer and turn the fan on and then it's going to be funny like actually this may not be such a stupid idea because that handles a lot of air so it keeps your computer quite cool I think and but it looks kind of stupid in at the same time so yeah I would not do let it bias on or something but like a fan that you can put you know on top or somewhere oh yeah so you brake your car seat or something and you have no more car seats so you just put the wooden chair I think it's a - somehow and you tie yourself to a wooden chair no need of the normal chair of the seat no need car seats are perceivers useless oh so your car headlight breaks so no I'm not going to go repair it I'm just going to install like three or four three three flashlights and I'll just turn the flashlights on and it should do the trick right no need of go into a repair shop and go repair your flies and everything no need flashlights through the trees always oh so you use the role of state you stick it on your dashboard and you can put your cup in the tape roll and it holds that's quite a smart invention until the state pairs off and then you're gonna have coffee all over the place but I mean it's worth the risk right now technologists don't do that you're just going to have coffee all over your car and then if you can have the fan base the doorbell is missing please shake bottle of rocks no doorbell no doorbell just put the bottle with rocks and just shake it on their bubble and you're gonna have it you're gonna wring this straw makes absolutely no sense to shake the rock and then you're gonna wring yeah that's smart but this will do it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe it will be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in tomorrow's video so as you tomorrow stay here and I'll see you in the next why do I keep saying that just stupid see you tomorrow bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] you Oh [Music]
