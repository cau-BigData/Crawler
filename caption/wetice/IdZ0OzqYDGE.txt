hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you I am back again today we are going to do something different than usually this room is different I'll show you later as I said previously I'm now at a different place of the room with the same wall and sitting down this is where I'll do some other things some reviews and some some talkative videos that I don't want to do at my desk so today we're going to do something that I'm really excited about because it's involving my salt iOS 11 came out to base a couple weeks ago now I was at that time in France and I could not record video so I'm here and I downloaded and installed our West eleven now I'm super excited for this as I said because it's a complete change and so far what I saw on it it's different it's it's a lot different it's a lot Bank I mean in some ways it's better in some ways it's more annoying I find so you are normally on your iPhone screen everything's great now the first thing that I saw it's completely different is the control panel so if you just swipe up this control panel comes up and it's completely different and the thing I love about it is that before and I was 10 you had to swipe like three times uh you know you have to swipe you had to swipe three times just to find whatever you wanted to do with your control time control panel control settings it was kind of annoying so this time it's all on one screen you can control everything from the brightness to the sound and it's all just an amazing thing for it to be now you can select your boot two of your cellular your your Wi-Fi here and it's just really really really great and I love it now you can select your your rotation for the screen to be blocked and so on then one really super thing that I find that super amazing the bailout is whatever you need to do like go to battery saver mode you just press on it and your battery saving mode you don't have to go all the way to the settings or wait until your battery the 20% that it tells you that you can go to battery saver you just have to click on one button and then remove it it's just so easy so easy now what other thing if you have the Apple TV it's an awesome way because you can just pop up the remote really quickly now we're going to find my Apple TV and select it and you can turn it on and it's just amazing so basically you have your Apple TV remote on access and you can just choose it then you can have also your calculator your flashlights your camera normal of course the bender the new thing that for you drive do not disturb while joining so it tells me you will not receive applications while you are driving so that's perfect is ideal for anyone who's driving and doesn't want to be your dated by text or by calls or by anything so that's an awesome thing that's here now you can have your home kit so I my room is not really plugged yet but as you can see I have one one lap going on so you can control that you can select you can click hold on it you can set the brightness of your lab the color of course and so on so it's it's quite a really good thing that I enjoy so this is like the first hello something just happened that's not normal something just really happened and I have no idea what happened my screen just went like this that's good question what just happen I'm restarting my phone let's see what really happened okay so it's restarting super now we just have to wait for a while until it's restarted so hold on so apparently all of my photos are gone alright so we're back with the phone that's something that just happened it prob'ly bug there's some things I have what does that I have no idea what just happened but this is where we can lead us to screen recording so the new thing as you can see this thing that's flashing all right and I'm going to stop it otherwise you won't see anything but basically you can screen report what's awesome if I want to show you something on my phone but of course saved to your phone so I don't have all the storage that may become a problem but overall it's great that you can screen record something like if you want to send them part of the movie you don't have to extend the whole movie just said like a small portion of whatever you want now I'm talking too much but that's an awesome awesome feature now as I was browsing on now we're in the I can I was I was right browsing on if you go to the App Store it's like completely different it's just like like like news this for I believe where you just scroll down you have the app of the day what's the update they want Journal but I mean everything is just like a swiping thing now I I don't know it's like a today thing what you have today what's made today or maybe something like that it's interesting it's different now different sometimes it's better sometimes not but in this case I find it's different it's a change in the app store then you have your games or you have one thing only for games so that's pretty good because for the people who want just game they can have just games what's fun applications there's one and then you have the updates so and then they were just overall changes in like all the applications they looked a little highlighted and a lot nicer I mean it sista just a new design and that's what I like about it and also the numbers changed and it's a really nice nice feature to change all the fonts and just to keep it fresh looking now I found a few bugs in it it's not released it's going to be released the I think in like October exact fall I think it's it's in fall and it's going to be it's going to be an interesting update and for sure just a lot of things that have to be done on it but if you want to try it out for yourself you just have to go to the Apple website and you can sure find iOS 11 basis download it to your phone it's going to just kind of like verify you and then you're going to just go to your general settings your software update is going to give you that that you can install it so that's awesome awesome I'm excited for iOS 11 release I'm super excited super super super excited as you can see so anyway guys into it for this video if you
