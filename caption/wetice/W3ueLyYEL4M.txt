hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released Iowa's 13.2 developer beta for to the registered developers just a week after beta 3 we are going to take a look at the changes and take a look at beta 3 and compare it to beta 4 let's get into this video so the first thing we're gonna go take a look at is Settings General about and software version as you can see we're running 13.2 and we're running 17 b 5 0 8 4 a so the a at the end means that this could be the GM bill or that we are very close to the release the final release of 13.2 we might be seeing the final release of 13.2 within a week or so but i'm gonna talk about that in more detail at the end of the video another thing if we just scroll down a little lower we're gonna notice that we're running a new bottom firm where we're going from 1.0 2.13 to 1.0 2.0 14 so that's a little update but it should help with any issues with connectivity if you've been having any however I didn't have any so far now what's new well so far into a beta it's really difficult to say what's new nothing really changed here now we should be mostly seeing bug fixes and security enhancements and that's pretty much what we have been seeing in this beta let's go take a look at what exactly we're seeing so one buck that was fixed was with RAM management so this bug has been in iOS thirteen point two since beta 1 and sometimes it would occur with the YouTube app that for example it would crash or it'll just keep relaunching every time so let's say you went into the YouTube app you got out to go look at a text message or something like that and then when you went back it would just reload and it would have to do that all over again but this seems to be fixed in beta 4 as you can see and it's it's working really well now Safari have the same issue if you left you would go back it would reload the page or even crash or even give you an error code but that seems to be completely fixed now also the volume HUD would sometimes get stuck on the side meaning that it would be this big thing just stuck on the side and you cannot without just manually pushing it away that's way you could however this was not very apparent on beta 3 anymore and now it seems like it's completely gone and we're not seeing it anymore now there were some issues with wireless charging on the iPhone 11 pro max because it has wireless charging capabilities but sometimes it wouldn't work or sometimes didn't work at all so that's an issue that was in beta 1 & 2 I wireless charged in beta 3 so it seems to be working there however in beta 4 I think it's completely fixed so you shouldn't have any issues with that but you should go test it out by yourself announce messages with Siri is back so it came back and it's working very well and some people report some issues but I so far didn't have any now in the music app I don't have the music app on my phone because that you Spotify but the music app has issues as well I mean had in the past there would be some animation delays when you would want to add a song to a playlist or if you would just want to download a song normally it would give you the whole UI however it would be lagged out and it would come out way after you already added the song however that issue seems to be fixed already sometimes you wouldn't get alerts for text messages so you'd get the banner and then you would get the badge down here however you wouldn't get the ding or whatever sound you have set up so that'll be really annoying and I experienced that at some times I got an important text message that I was waiting for and I just didn't hear the ding so I just couldn't get back to that person I didn't have time to test that out but I will test it out but it seems to be fixed for now now one issue that many people reported was that you would have the GPS symbol showing up up here but for me I don't see it I have location services on but some people reported that even when they had location services off it would still show the GPS icon on top and even when it was on I don't have anything like that it seems to be working perfectly for me but that might vary person to person now for the performance the performance seems great for now I mean I have no issues and I've had no issues during the whole beta series so there are no app crashes so far there's no lag or stutter however that depends on the person and depends on what apps you use so for me my apps don't crash the animations are smooth and everything really works well and I have nothing to complain about except some of the issues of reloading in Safari and YouTube now battery life battery life is a really good topic and since I got the iPhone 11 Pro max battery life has been amazing the reported battery life is 18 hours if you use your phone pretty much all day however I have not been using my phone all day I use it quite little recently as you can see about three hours on screen so nothing really brutal however if I use it a lot then I would go pretty much more than a day and right now I go about two days with the battery life on this phone so I really recommend the iPhone 11 Pro max if you don't use your phone way too much then you can have back to you life for a really long period of time and even if you use your battery life a lot then you will be really happy to have this battery life so battery life and I was 13.2 generally was very good I didn't have any issues whatsoever it seemed really good but of course my battery health I'm at 100% because it's a new phone so there might have been some bias before because like your battery health was lower so you shouldn't expect any battery drain or any issues whatsoever here but then again that can depend on many devices and many different factors so for me battery life is great for some people and older devices especially it might not be so great now when should we see the public release of iOS 13.2 so if we go look into the calendar we know that the solo beats Pro are going to come out on the 30th so I would expect that the public release of 13.2 will be next week probably early next week so 28 or 29 already discussed about that in my previous video but we should be seeing that soon the public beta should also be coming today unless it already has as of the time of this recording well this is the end of
