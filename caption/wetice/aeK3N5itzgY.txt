hello guys welcome back to another video today we have some interesting news from Apple finally the long-awaited iOS 12 point 1.4 has been released for everyone it's another stable update so if you're excited for all the news and changes then drop like down below and consider subscribing to stay informed with all the latest Apple news the update is pretty small it's about a hundred megabytes there's a few bug fixes and Apple doesn't write too much about it it just says that it just says that it provides important security updates and is recommended for all users yes it is because it fixes the most important issues we've been having the FaceTime bug so the FaceTime bug what it allowed you to do is when you call someone the other person would not even pick up yet and you'd already hear him talking so to pick up before you actually picked up and even if he muted the call you would see that person so that's fixed now in iOS 12.1 point for now to protect all the users from FaceTime and all of this they disabled group FaceTime on all software updates except iOS 12 point one point four so that's pretty much the main focus of this update however there are a few more changes on the Apple website which shows a bunch more changes that fix some other bugs while they were fixing the FaceTime bug they noticed that there was kind of an issue in the live photos so that has been improved as well it is quite a crucial update which provides small and important security updates and otherwise no other changes performance is good I have had it on my iPhone 7 plus for a while now it's cool it's doable it's not slower or faster or anything so performance wise good as you know iOS slope point to beta 2 has been released to the public beta which brings new changes and it is currently in the beta testing so if you want to have the FaceTime bug fixed and get group FaceTime back you have to downgrade to iOS 12.1 point four which is kind of I don't understand yeah but anyway I was talking to beta two brings neon emojis and minor UI changes which is super fun to see always anyway should you update yes you should go update if you're in iOS twelve point to beta two then while you're stuck with it unless you want to downgrade but just it fixes a massive privacy breach that isn't a must for everyone anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Music] [Music] you
