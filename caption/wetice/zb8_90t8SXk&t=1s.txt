what's up guys recently there have been many issues regarding the air pods where some people we're losing functionality many people also said that their noise cancellation was not as good as before and there were some weird sounds starting to appear so let's go through these issues and look at how you can update to the new firmware as well as solve some of these issues so starting off there is a new firmware version which is called 2d 1 5 but it isn't as simple as that to update as it is on your iPhone so let's take a look at that so you're going to take your air pods put them in the case plug it into a power source or put it on a wireless charger and put them close to your phone this should make them update by themselves however if you don't want to bother and just update them when they'll update they will update over the next few days by themselves as you're using them so what are the problems with the air pots about a week back Apple released this new update for the air pods Pro and air pods - but what happened in this update well we have no idea because there is no clear description but if you are wondering if you should update then it is a definite yes the new update doesn't seem to have any issues because the noise cancellation is pretty much the same at least to my testing but for those that have been having issues with noise cancellation you can go directly to Apple for help now there is a new support page which shows you all how to troubleshoot this issue if you have been having it so there are a few steps firstly check if you are on the latest firmware which is to d15 on your iphone by going into general About section and then your air pods you can see it there and then put them in your ears and check if the noise cancellation is turned on and if it's working and to my surprise they say that you should try cleaning the mesh on top which is right here on both sides to see if there is some debris and if there is then like remove it so if it is not clean you will lack bass and there will be an increase in background noises which is why you might have lost noise cancellation so if you have these issues then try to clean it off and see if that fixes anything for you but what if it still doesn't solve these issues for you then you can contact Apple directly and they might just send you a replacement if your device is faulty further if you are having issues with crackling noises or static sounds there is a new support page for that as well they are saying that it might not have anything to do with the software itself but how you use them these kinds of issues might be caused by cement walls or any interference or many devices between you and the air pods further if you want to make your Bluetooth connection stronger they recommend you download music instead of streaming it so try to download the music and check if you don't have too many devices around you and then try them out if they don't however then forget the device restart your phone and pair them again to see if that will solve the issue for you but if that doesn't help either then reach out to Apple support and they will help you out hopefully this video helped you out and if it did then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you [Music]
