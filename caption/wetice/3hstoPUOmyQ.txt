alright hello guys and welcome back to another video how are you today today I'm going to be doing something similar to the previous videos I think May is going to be like a purely camera month but today I'm going to be talking about two of the best vlogging cameras out there right now both are from Canon one is the ATD and the other one is the g7 X mark - so the g7 x mark - is one of the best vlogging cameras in the world and the ATV is one of the best DSLRs for vlogging in the world so it's going to be interesting to compare these two now it's going to be a little bit difficult because the of course the ATD is a DSLR so it's a lot bigger where as logistics is a lot smaller which is really cool for traveling now that's what I'm going to start with first is the compactness of the g7 X the g7 X I've been recording it for a long time even before I got the ATD so and the 60 so it's been a great camera to travel it's good to in the pocket a great quality for what it is in the pocket whereas the ATD that I just got recently is a lot bigger is heavier of course but the quality compared to the g7 X is just massive so in the side-by-side comparison here where it's written on the bottom which one is the g7 X mark - and which one's the ATD you can see the difference so we are the same place you see the same mountain so both the same thing now both of them are not full-frame remember that as well so we're not dealing with a full frame and not full frame camera so the 36.8 gives you a zoom whenever you need to zoom in to something but since it's so compact you can just you know do whatever you want go close to anything but my lowest lens is a 10 to 18 or I have a 16 to 35 so both these lenses are not full frame as well so it's difficult to compare but now we have a big difference and it's the aperture of both let the aperture on the g7x is 1.8 to 2.8 so it is excellent in low-light environments so whenever I go somewhere in dark g7x is the first camera I take in the pocket now the 8 10 to 18 on the ATD is a 4.5 to 5.6 so as you can see it's a big jump between them so the light levels the aperture is a lot better on the g7x now one kind of sad thing that is about the g7x it doesn't have a microphone port which means you cannot put an external microphone on it whereas on the ATD you can put an external microphone on top which makes your audio quality ten times better I'm not complaining about the audio quality on the g7x but it could be better since it has just a small microphone on top now also be careful when using the g7x I always put like the muffler on top because I'm scared of also touching the microphone and blocking the microphone which happens to me sometimes and that's really annoying whereas it can all happen to you on the ATD but that's kind of a stupid comparison now whenever you put your finger on top of the microphone of course it doesn't work so then you have crappy videos with no sound and that happened to me and it's really annoying so be careful about that and one more thing to say is the g7x performs really well in windy weather with the mic with the muffler on top way better than the microphone on top with the big muffler fix it's more exposed whereas the one in the g7x is inside so that's like a big difference but isn't like the main kind of things I would say to these two cameras so the quality difference still side by side there's a big difference I prefer the ATD some prefer this canon g7x you know just choose which one you like the most so if you have any more suggestions or questions ask them down below or give the suggestions down below in the comment section otherwise leave a like and subscribe and I'll see you next time alright bye [Music] you
