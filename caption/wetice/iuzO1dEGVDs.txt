hello everybody welcome back to another video so today's topic is I'm just gonna review these air pods so it's been like two years now probably that I've had these so I use them all the time and I just want to review it properly finally Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhones like two years ago and then introduced the Apple earpods for $159 starting price so you may think well apples kind of just mean to you because he makes you spend an extra dollar for having air pots but of course they provide dongles that can work with other headphones but that's not about this so all the phones followed afterwards so everyone just follow that bull with the phones and like no headphone jack so it's kind of more common than ever now so what is it being like for me to use these ear plugs pretty much on a daily basis and whenever I travel and whatever they're just really useful there are three major points in this review and that's convenience price and sound quality so let's start with the sound quality because that's an important part of buying headphones and honestly $159 for air pods that don't have a very good sound quality it's kind of it's expensive so the air pots don't have a very good sound quality but they work and they're convenient so I listen to podcasts and music on them all the time and music it's not the best but podcasts like listening to someone's voice it's okay it's it's really good actually it's like it's fine it's functioning but with music there's not a very big difference compared to the standard wired ear pod like ear pods that you get with your phone so to pay $159 to have a very similar thing like your wired headphones just a little bit of more bass it's not really worth it unless you want the convenience which leads me to the second point which is the convenience so to carry this around in your pocket it literally fits everywhere where you want to fit you don't spend time untangling all the cables and like taking care of all that just take your ear pods you open up the box take out your ear pods I can't take them out now take out the ear pods for them in your ear and you're good to go so really really useful as a feature like this you're not stuck with wires and just spending a lot of time doing that now one thing they look kind of weird in your ears but it's something you'll deal with and it's something that you get used to and at the beginning they were like falling out but I would say like my ears adapted to that now so that the ear pods hold in my ears which is kind of crazy but that's what it is let's say this could be an inconvenience compared to wired headphones or the air pods is that you have to charge this so it would be great to have like the Apple watch wireless charging just place it on the mat and it charges that would be really ideal but hopefully you were going to see something like that in the future now the connectivity is really great since I expected it to be more of a hustle all the time like plugging your earphones so I mean you open the box you take your ear plugs out put them in your ears connect it to your phone your watch whatever so switching between iOS devices is really easy so like between iPad iPhone watch very easy and easy peasy quick however to connect to the Mac it's a gamble so it works one out of two times so I mean the connectivity could be better but I always had problems with the connectivity on the Mac so it's not something new what surprised me a lot as well was the battery life that this little thing has and that it lasts about a week for me with about three hours a day of you which is impressive or even more if I don't use them so it's really impressive how much battery life this small box can have but that's really important because with wired headphones you don't have battery you don't worry about charging your earphones so that's something that's can be inconvenient for some people but it's usually lasting a long time at the end so the verdict well they're not perfect the airports are not perfect but nothing's perfect but you could have better value for this for example buying Marshall headphones which I own but again then you lose the convenience which is something really nice to have so I really hope that airports 2 will come out soon I was hoping that they would come out during the Apple event in September but nope maybe towards the end of the year that's what I'm hoping for so good anyway if you enjoyed this video leave a like and subscribe if you want more videos like this reviews tech videos I love doing this so let me know and I'll do more okay take care I'll see you next time bye
