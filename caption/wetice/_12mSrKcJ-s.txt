200 that's the number we're talking about today so this is a big jump by yes from Zanzibar we're gonna go back to Zanzibar name on Monday this video is just kind of a video I did not expect to make before I kind of stopped the Zanzibar videos even though we're home from Zanzibar now just ignore that today we reached 200 subscribers actually on Monday but today is the day I address it I'm very thankful very happy obviously as you can see and grateful for every single one of you who subscribe and click the subscribe button and it's part of the team and part of the White House blog ID I have no name yet but it's been a hard road from 1 to 200 and and I learned a lot during the path to 200 subscribers so this is really impressive and I'm speechless you may ask why I'm posting this video so like why not on Monday because actually I was waiting to have a little bit more than 20 subscribers 201 so that if someone unsubscribe does not be a video that's kind of off topic when I'm not at 200 subscribers so I wanted to prevent that so I actually make the video now and you yeah so I did you see I'm just speechless then and it wasn't Monday and I don't know it's just something to really think about and it feels like a lot even though you know you have thousands of subscribers but 200 for me 200 for me is big surreal I never expected to be at 200 subscribers so it really surprised me in a positive way and I'm very happy but we're gonna be Nora back to the normal schedule on Monday with Zanzibar video so just ignore this video just imagine I'm still in Zanzibar and just yeah I kind of oiled it but it may I made so many videos that I make extra in Zanzibar just not to come home and just make home videos so that you don't get confused and now I just screwed it up I'm not saying it's a bad thing to have 200 subscribers just not the right time I should say yeah that's kind of bad to say it's always the right time for 200 subscribers except it kind of like which is whatever I'm very grateful thank you very much I'll see you next time and I'm sorry for the people who wanted to watch a normal video today and they get this but yeah I thank you the one who clicked this video and the one who was expecting the video I thank you personally very much for staying here and sticking with me yeah alright so take care and I'll see you next time don't forget to leave a like and subscribe and we get to 300 subscribers alright take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music]
