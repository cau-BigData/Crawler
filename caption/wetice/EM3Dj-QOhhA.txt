hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video when I'm in a great mood to it that split that was a fast intro actually I'm sorry about that but sorry about the fast SuperDuper fast intro but I'm super excited to get into today's review video because today couldn't be a review now really video and put it all together okay I'm super excited as you can see today but we're going to make a review today we're going to review something that I love the most this this no this is this for y'all is called the philips hue light bulb so let me just talk about it a little bit so these levels are quite expensive but what's behind them without show later in the video is that they can change into whatever color their I think 16 million color you can choose from like you know the scale or you can go with your finger and choose whatever color and you can also have whites and you know the normal standard light and so on there are just many many things you can do with them now you have to install the Philips hue app so if you look over here I have my remove over here as you can see so if I click on that it's going to show me my ceiling lamp and my small lamp now if you want me to make like a review for because I have two light bulbs one is silat and wanted an original but it doesn't work as well but if you want I'll make I'll talk about those but anyway back to the video as you can see here this is the ceiling lamp as to what I have sort of with the Philips hue you can turn it on with the switch here so then you have scenes where you can select themes of whatever type you want I just set up a few you have Arctic aura sunset and so on you can set them by yourself but that's that's not important about this so with the Philips you app you can literally control your life in the whole house if you really want to but these light bulbs they're pretty expensive so you should be careful about spending them and spend your money wisely so if you can see it looks like a normal white light bulbs all right you can put it up and they sudden different size this I don't know how this is called this is the e 27 I think and then you have the e 14 and so on I don't really know but that's like the diameter of the light bulb or something I don't know but they can choose that on on Amazon that's the best place to get them and that works well so you can just set the color of your room and be like a nice nice room not with like this white light that is yellow eyes what I cannot stand anymore persisting for an extended long time when I'm editing I rather edit in like colors and then you know it goes little faster and it's easy and it's fun and it's nice but that's great about that now let me just show you how it actually works so now as you can see you have next thing this is just for testing purposes this is where you would have put your light bulb in right so you're going to want to put the light bulb here so if I take the light bulb as you can see over here I'm just going to screw it on top here there we go so once it's created it's going to be like this so if we turn the switch on normally what happens when you set the light bulb at we just need to plug it in that's it - you have to do it once it turns I need to pair your view bridge but I'm not going to talk about that unless you want so this is just purely the light bulb if you want I can talk about the whole so lets you set up and how to do it that's a good idea but let me just talk about the light bulb so for the light bulb connectivity is pretty easy to connect to the hue bridge and then to your phone so there's no problem with that now when I turn the switch on as you can see it's going to go through yellow as an original light so you can use this level even to switch it on and off for no reason but then it will be only yellow now this is kind of creepy how it look now but this is an excellent way to test it so I have my phone here and I have a few of the kind of things where you can choose from the colors now I'm just going to play with it a little bit so watch if I go to lies you see the ceiling lamp but now it's on so what I can do I can switch it off as you can see no more light and I can switch it on there we go in life that's perfect right and I can also adjust the brightness here so more like less light perfect so now if I show you this is less light I mean more like let's let more light less light so you can adjust the brightness however you want now if we click on the light we just have to we can change colors as you can see it's going to look kind of weird but I can just go from red to blue to green to whatever color in between and it's just an awesome thing as I mentioned you can just wheel around on this and choose whatever color you want and select it so it's not that hard and it's very easy if you don't want to select stuff what you can do is you have some scenes there preset or you can make your own scenes what you just have to do is click on seals there we go and just select a scene so I okay this is blue octy Goro now the great thing with this is we have multiple light bulbs around your place because then you can set different colors on each light bulb it makes the room a lot nicer gloomier and just a happy place so you can see now is blue and if I just you know I can adjust the brightness of the blue I can put it to highest prices so I can do literally whatever I want so the easy connectivity is a great plus for this I have no issues with that whatsoever it's just so clever there's nothing to do and you reach the Pew bridge quickly so big plus for the Phillips you light bulb they also a Phillips you strips which is excellent what I don't have yet but I plan to use some of them later but this light bulb I really recommend if you have the money and if you want to have like a nice place with some lights that are colorful I really recommend this lifeboat I love it I've been using it for two months now I believe yes for two months and I just had positivity with it and you just select whatever you want whatever theme you want one more thing it works with Siri but you have to have the official view light bulb otherwise it won't work so you can just tell Siri to turn the light bulb on and off it's going to do it what's perfect so you can literally say whatever color you want and it's going to work just try it for yourself now if you want me to show you like the whole setup as I mentioned and with the room with multiple eyeballs of LEDs I'll make like a whole you thing whole you review and whole you showcase and room tour of that but I'm going to do this later when I'm going to move to another room and I'm going to you know redo it and put some other stuff how about that so this was it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future really hope you enjoyed this review I enjoy making reviews I hope you enjoy watching them and you learn something new but anyway guys they care and I'll see you in tomorrow's video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
