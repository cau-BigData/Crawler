hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some exciting news we have some changes we have a design confirmed for the iPhone 11 or X I so anyway leave a like down below if you're excited let's get into this video as you remember in my previous video compared Raja brought some prototypes there were two prototypes and now one of those prototypes is confirmed to be in the iPhone 11 in 2019 we also have some information about the camera and a bunch of other things for the new iPhone let's get into it so Kabir Raja brought us two different prototypes to look at we have one confirmed prototype and that is this one iPhone 11 one of them will look like this so the iPhone is completely different looking we are not used to this kind of iPhone but I don't know how to feel about it but let me know your thoughts down in the comments and I just want to see your reaction because honestly I feel like it's a complete different change to have a horizontal camera compared to the vertical cameras that we have been seen for a long time now now let's get into the details and we may be seeing also a new color option so we're going to be seeing the standard space grey silver and gold next to that compare Raja has put a blue design so I am super excited about the blue one even though it kind of looks a lot like the blue that we see in the iPhone X are but they could make a little bit darker and it would be a lot better but a fourth color and the iPhone excess or excess Max would have been great now we may be seeing it in the iPhone 11 the screen size will be pretty much the same at five point eight inches but the bezel is going to get smaller which means there's gonna be more screen space if you want so that's gonna be really interesting to see and also the not should get a little bit smaller if not even disappear in the final product we will still be keeping ip68 watcher and dusters stens because we've been seeing that now in the new iPhones and I think it should stay there or it may even go up so that the phone can even be completely water resistant forever not only for a couple minutes under water now the exciting part we may be seeing a four thousand milliamp battery which is something we never saw in an iPhone and that's a crazy amount of power so to compare the iPhone access right now has two thousand six hundred fifty eight milliamps of battery so it's almost a 1500 milliamp increase of battery which means you could potentially even go one and a half day or two days where your iPhone depends on the usage let's talk about USBC and the port's we may be seeing on the new iPhone so as you know Apple has been talking about the new USBC to put it on their iPhones they did that on the iPad so it's really kind of looking like they may even put it on their iPhones but I want to be great about that that we may be seeing that and you could have one charger for your macbook for your iPhone and for your iPad that would be really really cool not to have a lightning port and then a USB see it would also introduce a bunch of other options like you could connect the screen maybe or you could just connect a driver whatever that'll be a really cool to see one thing that Apple talked about is 5g but unfortunately we won't be seeing it in the new iPhone in 2019 but that's gonna be pushed all the way to 2020 which is not so far away but anyway 5g is not really here to much for geez all over the place but five g's not so broad yet so we have to wait till 2020 and hopefully by then we're gonna have 5g everywhere let's talk about the camera specs now so we'll finally be seeing a megapixel upgrade and what we may be seeing is the camera on the front we'll go from 8 megapixels all the way to 10 which will noticeable on your selfies and all of that unfortunately I don't have any images to show you but we will be seeing that soon the main camera on the back will probably have three cameras now one will be ten megapixel which will be a downgrade one will be 14 megapixels which will be an upgrade and the third one is not sure yet so we don't know anything about the third one yet but one 10 megapixel 114 we may be seeing even better megapixels on these cameras but this is what we have right now so the iPhones have been at 12 megapixels for a long time now and 14 megapixels is gonna be really good and noticeable on your pictures with all of this this iPhone is shaping to be a really good phone and it's really going to be probably a comeback year for Apple with a bunch of new features and a bunch of new things like that and it's probably going to be even bigger and upgrade compared to 2017 to 2018 iPhones but anyway leave a like down below if you learn something new and if you're excited for the new iPhones and let me know in the comments down below if you would buy this iPhone and what are your feelings on all of this information also don't forget to subscribe to not miss out on anything new and all the Apple news
