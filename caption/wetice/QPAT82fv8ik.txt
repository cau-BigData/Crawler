[Music] good morning guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so I'm super energized right now because I slept like a good night of 10 hours or something like that after yesterday sleeping almost nothing I was dead yesterday and well we're gonna start a new day today yesterday I had some problems with the GoPro time-lapse so I could not put it into the video so we bought an SD card and I'm gonna try to fix it hopefully to wreck and get some time-lapse shots and and it will be nice so it's gonna be kind of weird because I'm making a new vlog while this vlog is just being is uploading here it's great since the Wi-Fi in the hotel it takes me to up all about 25 minutes which is amazing because in some hotels it can take up like 8 hours so so that's great I was gonna go at 12 p.m. every day for the next 2-3 days ok so let's go to breakfast and we're gonna go explore alright guys so we are going up right now back doom after a great breakfast except and I wish floor here I think it should be up here to 5 yes 2 5 8 hello good morning you're cleaning Oh how long did I go [Music] okay so we just arrived we just came to out I mean out of the hotel we are walking in a narrow street again a small narrow street that's empty there are many kitchens here but you cannot even see the street how it curves around it it's bad dark but we although tell we're going to explore Venice again we are going to a place where they make on those [Music] see to be hell [Music] okay so we just finished a small session in the cafe again and we're walking around Venice and what we notice which is quite interesting that all the buildings are in like very bad shape and they are being repaired and and you're some of them but some of them are really dead and closed and people don't live here anymore what is it's sad that people don't live here anymore but there are many tourists and many many people still come visit this place and what is also found in the gondoliers they are waiting in the middle with their gondolas and and just calling for people [Music] okay next stop sunny Venice is really sunny all day we came the perfect week on is the sunniest that's what I really like and well I'm getting some shots from different different angles so I hope you enjoy them and now we came to some kind of part since we are normally in like the very touristy area anymore because we left all the shopping and all this like expensive shops so we are in middle of like more living venice type of place where there's not so many things since it's only mostly locals here but we can explore and we should be soon where they make all I got because basically we knocked on the guys door maybe you could have let us in but no of course not it was like paste or something they did not want to let us in because it'll all the work or something so that's kind of sad because that was what I want to show you guys but we're going to do now is go for lunch because it's like 12:00 12:30 now and we're gonna go eat some pasta again but we came to this kind of porty area now what is after the gondolas and we're gonna see what we can find this afternoon okay so we just finished in the restaurant I ate a pasta again I love pasta and since we're in Italy it's pasta and pizza time and now it's kind of noisy here because boats are coming and also it's kind of crazy but then I'll tell you guys that there was a DHL boat just going just casually going you know you normally you have trucks but then you have these DHL boats what are quite strange and weird to see in Venice so now we are just going going on to our next place we're going to return to the rialto bridge and from there probably going to take gondola or a boat but that's quite a walk from here [Music] [Music] got lost again we're looking at the map for like half an hour because we got so lost again we have to use our phone as a GPS know where we are because the map is so stupidly made now what you're going to do is make our way to the rialto bridge a little bit and then we are going to go back to walk a little bit and back to the hole okay so we got unlost now and we're just kind of starting to follow the map a little bit because you would get lost too much and now we're just going to go find back away and we're going to see some shops and go back to the hotel it's me I was like okay so we just finished off in the city a little bit where there were no shops now what we're going to do is go to grab a taxi both backseat and go ahead to go till I'm gonna edit this vlog later earlier today because my friend wants to go shopping so I'm gonna edit while they're doing that and then we're gonna go for dinner later on but for now let's find about to go [Music] okay we are back on the boat taxi we are almost at our hotel destination is right in front of us I think and I'm gonna start editing this video but later on we're going to go for dinner but around 7:00 since you know that they open all the restaurants around 7:00 okay well I'm at the hotel now I just want to say something real quick the hotel there's no echo in the room seriously if I would have my room like this I would be so amazed there's no echo seriously in this room now we just arrived from the boat ride as I showed you and what we're going to do now at least I am going to is sleep okey dokey guys well some some I just want to say some pass this time no some time has passed from the last clip I slept a tiny little bit like one or two hours perfect for me now what I want to do is basically from last clip of like three hours or so I slept for a while I've started editing this video because what I like to do is get ready because I never know if I'm gonna stay outside for a while or something basically what I wanted to say I just started editing woman here I just started editing the vlog and if I show you I'm here on this sitting here here last night I was editing it in the bed was not the best idea since I was tired and probably the vlog that's not the best of my effort but here it is here is the vlog today so it's I know it's starting to be really confusing to you guys but this is the vlog this is the last play but you saw I'm still waiting for my friends to come back from their shopping spree thing I'm a do occur while the oh the acoustic oh oh the sound okay it sounds a lot better in here now they're coming back shortly hopefully but in between I'm still gonna finish editing that video I'm gonna watch some YouTube videos and then we're going to head off for dinner yo yeah they just called me that I should go downstairs so I'm just gonna put my snooze and let's go downstairs I don't know what but I could not lock the door with the key need not to work so I'm going downstairs now they should be in the left bar of the hotel and do I have my battery for the camera yes I have okay so let's go down I did not lock the door because I don't know why and we are going to go have dinner okay so we are out of the hotel and we are basically we were watching my vlog we kind of we should be at 8:00 at the restaurant and it's 750 or something like that well we're kind of late again but we should be there on time because you're kind of going fast now and we're back at the San Marco Plaza so let's go okay so we just finished in we just finished in the restaurant we are walking back to San Marco Plaza and we're going back to the hotel so it was another great day full of fun and we looked through Venice thoroughly again we were on the other side perfect day and I'm just amazed with all what I did to the end we did so far in the two days but we have still one full day tomorrow and then like another day because we're leaving around for the 30th so well we have still some time [Music] to look around Venice and explore it a little bit more where people live but we are still going to look even in the places where we have not been yet tomorrow we have some trips planned to the other side completely of Venice and maybe even out to the open sea kind of area but it's going to be cool and Venice is beautiful at night what I did not expect also but let me show you some shots before we end the video sorry [Music] okay guys so we just arrived to the hotel we are about to go to the hotel room and finally go relax after the whole day even though I relaxed this afternoon I'm super energized
