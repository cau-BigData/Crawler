hey guys and welcome back to a new vlog so today is a Saturday and I decided since it's like December already that we're going to go get the Christmas tree not a fake one a real one we are on our way now to get the tree and then we're gonna decorate my room and also the Christmas tree so that's gonna be fun okay guys we have the tree yes and now let's put it inside the car sorry everything that I've done never see to be all he'll call me out as this thing [Music] as you saw GPS please ah as you saw in the previous clip I loaded the tree the Christmas tree into the car now it fits is right right next to us here it's I mean it fit into the car but now we are starting to be hungry and me and my friend want to go eat something so we're going to go to McDonald's because we have nothing else around and there we don't feel like going to the shop or anything so yeah we're let's go eat okay guys so we are home and now see the tree is here so we're gonna take it out [Music] I was wondering after all these years you like to go everything they say the time supposed to helium but I'm done much he'll come as I can see it free well I think your ass is going to go thanks tears we don't fit okay do you like oh oh you're inside hi did you push the button okay guys so we're in the elevator now with this gigantic gene I'm surprised that it's even fit into the elevator okay [Music] [Music] I already made a mess ok so we are going to I'm at least going to go get a knife now try to open it oh that you know we can see how nice it is alright so I'll be out of light back ok so I have these two things this is where we're going to put the tree in but under it we have this kind of small thing Merry Christmas by the way and that's where do you want to put it like here maybe like this go with this here look good alright so now so now as you can see the trees over here and let's try to open it and see it is nice let's go from the top I get or no we should probably go put it first in the understand that would be smarter but will it fit doesn't fit dang it doesn't feel then it's small big we need to go cut it I need to go find some kind of tool that I can cut get a little better than a fate so let me go do that okay so let's take him up all right you can see they remain a gigantic mess while cutting the bottom of the chain but it fits perfectly now and now if you just move over i'm just going to keep it here for now until I'm opening it so I'm gonna grab my scissors and you see from the top it's kind of hard to remove this plastic or whatever it is but I'm going to remove it [Music] [Music] you dang it on the bottom it's going to be hard since the trees opening up it looks nice the tree in fact Victor's do this thing this off okay all that but here you're on the bottom it's gonna be hard since its opening up open it okay let us remove it completely delay seriously just remove it Wow last year I could not even remove it so quickly well this plastic thing is out now go away so the tree looks nice let's open him up it's a nice one I like it now the only thing we need to do is take him dang it always to it okay well I could have placed it a little better there we go it looks nice it's put it's all good gonna be here in the corner and now the only thing else we need to do is to clean this mess up a little bit and then start putting decorations okay so i'm removing all this dirt here that we can start decorating the tree a little bit because otherwise who are taking this all over the place and even hurts feat the first thing of the tree is complete the first light look well it's kind of you just nothing really special yet but it's starting to look nice is going to look nicer once we finish again we're going to start we're gonna put these lights now so that's going to be fun to untangle now but that's gonna be cool so I'll be right back [Music] alright guys so as you saw in the previous shot we've put all the lights on the Christmas tree so now it's all done with the lights as you can see the tree is quite nice now now we're gonna put the gear lines we put some small figures down here just like for the decoration or something decorations sake but that's how basically it's going to look nice now we need to find the gear lines as you can see we have all our stuff here ready for the Christmas tree so that's how it is [Music] [Music] I Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music]
