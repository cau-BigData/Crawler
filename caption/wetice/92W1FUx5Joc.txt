hello guys how are you today another video today we're actually going to look at another kind of technological thing let's say today I'm going to change the case of my computer which was actually a bit quiet what's actually terrible and I'm gonna talk about it maybe later but today we're going to be actually opening well we're not gonna be unboxing we're just going to be looking at the case from Corsair the courser 540 air or air 540 it's a really great case as review say it's from Corsair so I have a lot of trust so let's get into it alright so this is the front side of the Corsair case now over here we have the two USB ports where you can just plug in whatever small device then you have the headphones and microphone port the on switch over here and the disco kind of thing and button I don't see the purpose tool then here you have where you can put your CD drive thing or as I put it's the SD card the kind of reader that I have over here in the front panel over here as you can see you have the output of your fan what it's probably going to be quite a powerful one then over here right next to it this whole that may seem completely irrelevant is actually for the motherboard where the output of all the things comes out then a right below it over here you have all of the places where like the graphics card output and every other card output will come out then over here this big hole here um this is for the power supply to give power to the computer um and then some air comes over here then these two things right here they're just kind of unscrew both thingies which basically lets you do that on the side as well and on the top and they let you unscrew them from out of panel or the side panels all right so this is when we open the case the front inside so as you can see here these two spots are for the hard drives fro from the bottom you have the dark put here then when you continue going up here you will see these two fans right over here these are the input of air fans which are quite good corsair fans are pretty sure you could have seen them from the front as well then you have the two cables for the fans right here then the fact that you cannot see but it's on this side is the outlet fan with also the the cable then here will be basically the motherboard and everything set right here and only I found also that I like this tech discs are directly connected to basically here so you're gonna have a cable running it's just plug there and the cables are back in the back and then you have these great cable management kind of thingies all over the place which like you organize all your cables in the weather it is alright so as you can see if the bundle of cables here that come up from the other side from the twists and everything and then they come out of these cable management things then up here we have this where you would have the CD thing or the SD card in my case and it will pop out from the front so this is where they'll be stored so here as you can see this is all for SSDs so actually you can put 5-4 SSDs in here which is actually great for an editing computer and then your power supply would be just kind of popped up here and the cable management is quite neat and that's probably it for this case and so this is the end of kind of the unboxing slash review of what I think of this case um basically this case looks really nice even by itself so that's a really great side it's kind of a nice cube what I really like instead of like a very tall high skyscraper so that's really nice it has a lot of air intake what I think will help a lot with the cooling of the computer and I think everything has a lot of space in it now the next video we're going to see is going to be actually taking out all the stuff from my previous computer and putting it into the new one which is going to create a great computer and I hope you'll enjoy that video as much as you enjoyed this one so if you enjoyed take care and I'll see you in my next video and don't forget to subscribe or leave a like alright see you next time bye [Music] you [Music]
