hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to talk about the whole way may 20x and pretty much talk about yesterday's video the vlog that you saw just to say that I am not really happy with the performance when vlogging when I was looking at the screen in the front I saw that it was great however I didn't hear the audio the audio when I listened to it on the phone was great but then when I put it into my editing software not so good so I'd like to take a look at all of that to tell you and kind of discuss all the footage as well as the audio so starting with the footage we can see that it has a really good low-light level really good that is a big big plus and also the camera works really well and pretty much all environments I was shooting on full auto so it does pretty much a great job however audio I don't know if it's it's that I had my hand on the microphone on either one side or the other but like I held it pretty much like this and it seems like the microphone is down here so that could have been an issue but if you want a vlog you want to really just pull out your phone and vlog so that's something I'm not really happy about and I think I'm gonna receive many comments on this like saying well you're stupid you should have held the phone differently but I never had this problem with the iPhone that's why I'm talking about this here because the audio should be captured in video from multiple places to have stereo and that's what it seems like it was because I had one side so like the right side audio was higher than the other side which means that one microphone could have been pretty much covered and the other one was not and therefore it made a weird effect of audio where one speaker would be louder than the others of one side or the other and basically to deal with that so that a vlog was actually listening bland so you could hear anything that I was saying I had to really go into my software and really really work on the audio from the phone which isn't really the best but that's I did so I'm not really happy about that pictures and videos generally are really really good I kind of want to review this phone vlogging wise I would not recommend it for vlogging because you're just gonna be so frustrated with the audio but so happy with the video that you'll be pissed that you got the phone now I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy the phone but the phone is really really good big screen great pictures great cameras it just doesn't cut it for vlogging listen to this clip here about the stabilization of the phone it works really well and listen to this one here the stabilization of the phone it works really well so the first one was unedited second one being edited so you can really hear the difference how the raw audio is and what I had to do to make the vlog to the place where it actually was something that you could hear yeah that's my frustration at the moment but overall I'm very happy with the phone just vlogging wise honestly make the phone like compensate for when you're holding it on one side or the other because obviously you have to hold it on one side to vlog like you cannot really vlog like this otherwise the video wouldn't be I don't know it'll be just like orchard not landscape will way do something about this audio thing because it's really really annoying especially if you want to have stereo audio anyway I hope you enjoyed this video I would love to know what you think about this and maybe tell me if you have some fixes for this or how to just bypass this issue cuz I'd love to use this for vlogging when I'm traveling as it just fits in your pocket you don't have to carry around a hefty camera so if you have a fix if you can give me some tips maybe or if it's just like an issue that you've been having please put it into the comments down below and don't forget to leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciate it it helps me so much and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
