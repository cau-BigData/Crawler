hello everyone and welcome back to another video it's the 23rd of October and we still have no news on the Apple October event so you know you might be thinking like yeah I mean last year it was on October 30th or so around that time but this year no invites were sent out and nothing is going on so let's just go look at some things that might be happening sometimes Apple might skip the October event and it looks like this is going to be the year they previously skipped it so it's nothing unprecedented this doesn't mean that if there is no onstage conference that there won't be any product release now let's go look at what we might be seeing within the next two weeks so this week and next week we should be seeing some things so the first thing we know is that Apple doesn't release products in November but it does sometimes in December so we might think that if products don't come now in October the last chance they will have this year is in December however Apple promised some products in fall so December would be kind of late the first thing that we can look at is the Mac Pro which was promised to be coming this fall so we should be launching very soon and it could be coming as soon as next week a couple weeks ago Bloomberg reported about the new iPhones new iPads and the 16 inch MacBook Pro and that was just before the Apple event in September now of course there were the new iPhones and a bunch of new things during that event so Bloomberg was almost 99% accurate with everything they said so they have a very good track record but if you scroll down a little lower you're gonna see that they said and talked about that we should see a 16 inch MacBook Pro this fall as well they also state that a redesigned iPad pro should be coming with the new cameras new processors and many more things and changes to add on top of that in the past week we saw a leaked image of the new 16 inch MacBook Pro design which has slimmer bezels and if you look closely you can see that the keyboard is much different as well maangchi quo also said that a keyboard be different and Ming Chico is a very very trusted source so many sources are confirming this plus there is a report from Mac rumors that was just released recently that the MacBook Pro 16 and should be coming towards the end of October so I personally think there is a very high chance that if you combine all of these rumors that these products should be coming and this might be on Monday to 28th or Tuesday to 29 but for sure not the 30th of October now you might be asking why not on the 30th of October well on the 30th of October Apple is reporting their fourth-quarter earnings and they never do anything on the day where they release those so we might not have an event but we should still be seeing a few products we should be seeing the new Mac Pro which is really exciting the new iPad pro with new cameras and a new processor and a bunch of new changes and the new MacBook Pro 16 inch which I'm personally really excited about nm planning to get another thing is the air pods Pro which might be coming soon but I wouldn't be so certain about that one because we didn't hear anything much about them there are just a few sources here and they're talking about it but nothing really clear and it's been reported so many times that it will be coming that I don't even know what to believe I remember back in March people were saying that the air pods Pro will be coming but it didn't so I just kind of am very skeptical about this and we should kind of lay back on this also the Apple tile tracking is supposed to be released and it can be released through a press release they don't need to make an actual event where they have to invite people just to talk about a product that will help you track your items like your keys or anything like that and for this there has been evidence in I was 13 supporting that it's going to be coming so we should be seeing this as well very soon now to add on top of all of that on Monday we should see the release the final release of Iowa's thirteen point two and that's because of the new beats solo Pro which need was 13.2 to function properly obviously Apple will release iOS 13.2 before the release of the headphones on the 30th of October which was already previously released now when you look at all of these factors it just starts coming together so Apple moving its earning call to Wednesday the 30th that's a sign the Bloomberg report which was 99% accurate and they reported the 16 inch MacBook Pro and the new iPad pros and I was 13 points who needs to come out for the new headphones next week so out of all of this I think it's pretty obvious that something is going to happen on Monday to 28th or on Tuesday to 29 next week well
