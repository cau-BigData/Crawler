what's up guys Apple released iOS 13 point four point one a couple weeks after the public release of thirteen point four which also comes a week after thirteen point four point five developer beta one I previously said that I was thirteen point four point one point two point three and point four already internally tested by Apple and will be released publicly over the next few weeks either way today we are looking at I was thirteen point four point one including the changes the bug fixes battery life as well as performance so the update came in at about ninety six megabytes on my iPhone X s but it will depend on what device you have and from which software version you're coming from in this case I came from a long time ago which gave me four point zero eight gigabytes let's head over into settings and go to general and about section and we can see that we are running software version 17 e26 - if we had a little lower we can see that our modem firmware is 2.05 dot thirteen which didn't change since the previous thirteen point four of course is still very dependent on which device you have but on this device it is this modem firmware what about the changes so Apple fixes an issue where devices running iOS thirteen point four could not participate in FaceTime calls with iPhones and Macs that are older so this actually is a very big bug fix that probably affected many people especially considering that not everyone has the latest device so communication was rather limited the next one is that it addresses a bug with the settings app we're choosing bluetooth from the quick actions menu on the home screen would fail so if you remember holding here and then clicking Bluetooth would not take you directly into bluetooth but rather crash or just not take you there at all so as you can see this bug was fixed and it's working further Bluetooth connectivity in general has improved massively on I was thirteen point for going from thirteen point three point one there are where many problems with your mouse connection or any Bluetooth device however this was partially fixed 13.4 but should be fully fixed in thirteen point four point one so if you had any Bluetooth connectivity issues then you should update as it could definitely fix them another bug that was specifically to the iPad where it dresses an issue on the iPad pro 12 point 9 inch fourth-generation and iPad pro 11 inch second-generation where the flashlight would not turn on every time from the lock screen so the 4th generation would be the 20/20 iPad that we took a look at last time if you missed that video then please click the card shown up there so basically this would prevent from turning on the flashlight from the lock screen I didn't test that I don't use the flashlight on the iPad but it would not turn it on every time so this bug should be fixed another major bug was with the VPNs previously so the VPN bug basically prevented the VPN from fully encrypting all your data leaving the device which would lead to some vulnerabilities however it is unclear just yet if it is fixed in thirteen point four point one but Apple didn't mention anything so I think it should be fixed here for those using the clips app you will have some updates as well this one will fully introduce the mouse and trackpad support as the main change on the iPad so you also get some new stickers and a bunch of other things if you are using the clips app so some other bugs for example the third-party Maps applications are still not showing up on the primary display and carplay however this is still the app which has to update for example ways so you just have to wait for that one the Instagram bug seems to be fully fixed and it was in 13.4 so I would not expect that to change in thirteen point four point one however the iMessage bug and text message bug in general is still here in thirteen point four but I didn't have time to test it out in thirteen point four point one just yet so this bug would basically prevent you from getting text message notifications on the lock screen or anywhere so you'd have to manually go into the messages app to check if you receive the message now what about performance and battery life well performance seems to be as good as it was in thirteen point so don't expect there to be any massive changes except if you had any of the previous bugs that I mentioned here then there should be a little bit of a speed boost but otherwise everything should run smoothly and there should be absolutely no problem now regarding battery life battery life is definitely good and I've been using it on my iPhone 11 Pro max and the battery life on 13.4 should be great now should you update to thirteen point four point one if you are having bugs or any problems then you should definitely update to thirteen point four point one especially if you use Bluetooth a lot or VPNs that might help a lot in this version however if everything is running smoothly for you and you have no issues on thirteen point four then there is really no reason to update but you can it will probably not bring any big bugs and the only thing it can do is make the software version more polished well if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up there ok take care and I'll see you my next video you
