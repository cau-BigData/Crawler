hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're looking at I was thirteen point three point one after three betas we're going to take a look at what's new some bug fixes performance and of course of the battery life and we are also going to take a look at whether or not you should update now let's look at some things at the beginning so of course here you can see that the update is at about four gigabytes however normally it's quite small at around 280 megabytes but for some reason mine is 4 gigabytes therefore it will vary depending on which device you have and which software version you are coming from even though it was a small update it's quite a major one so if you head over into settings and we go into general and about section we can see through running 17 d50 so that's the build number and just a little lower we're going to see the modem firmware which is 1.0 4.0 6 which went from 1.0 3.0 12 and I was thirteen point three so that's quite a big jump right over here if you had any connectivity issues regarding LTE Wi-Fi or anything in general then this should fix it now let's look at some of the new features so over in Settings the one big feature was in privacy location services system services and then here networking and wireless so if you click on that it's even gonna tell you turning off location for networking and Wireless may affect Bluetooth Wi-Fi and ultra wideband performance this basically what happened in the past is that it would still show the location symbol on top and what it would do it would still be tracking you even though this was off so now if you keep it on you have some additional functionality but if you keep it off it will renew some functionality but you will still be able to use airdrop and features like that but you can fully disable location tracking as of this point one issue that was previously was in screen time in communication limits you can basically select for your child if you have one with with which person she or he can communicate but before they could bypass that so this has been fixed now you need a passcode every time you want to make a change in this setting also another issue that was fixed was with the phone where basically many times if you were on speakerphone there would be an echo effect it would be quite annoying for many people especially when the other person was complaining that they heard the echo the mail application got some improve immense as well so the mail application had many issues starting in Iowa's 13 since the beginning but now there has been a result issue where remote images would still load when load remote images was off another fix was that it could cause multiple undos dialogues to appear in the mail app but I've had I didn't have any issues like this over the past beta and I was 13.3 so I believe that it was fixed but if you've had any of these issues than Apple fixed all of them now there's also an issue which i early noticed which was particularly annoying and it was in the FaceTime app so when you were FaceTime you know someone and you switched the camera to the back camera of the iPhone it would use the ultra wide lens instead of using just the wide one and this would be very annoying many times they'll be making FaceTime calls it would distort the person and it would not really work out also for some people push notifications failed to be delivered when on Wi-Fi of course I didn't have this issue otherwise I would have noticed it but many people had this issue also there was an issue fixed with carplay where some calls were distorted in certain vehicles I didn't notice this but it depends on what car you have and I've heard that it was mostly in Nissan's and Honda's now what about the performance and battery life so performance has been very good for me throughout this entire beta process and it's very similar to the one of 13.3 so you will definitely not have any big difference regarding performance in thirteen point three point one but many of the bugs that you had 13.3 will be now addressed and fixed what about battery life so battery life has been quite good for me ever since I was 13 there have been no problems whatsoever and if you look at the past strenght of course it depends how you use your phone and what battery life and capacity you have as you can see the battery life here is still at a hundred percent where some phones might have it at around ninety eighty or so so here the battery life is very good and I believe that it's about the same as in 13.3 so if you have any issues on older devices then this update might help with your battery life now should you update definitely you should update it's really worth it if you've had many of the bugs and if you expand especially if you care about your privacy then this update will really allow you to disable many of the features that track you however don't get your hopes up for better battery life and performances that is not the case it seems to be about the same as in 13.3 well this is the end of the video if you enjoyed then please leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this and also
