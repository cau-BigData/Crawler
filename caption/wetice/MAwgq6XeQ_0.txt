hello guys welcome back to another video today we have some exciting news more rumors on the air pods - so the airports - we're announcing 2018 which we've kind of supposed to come in 2018 but it's already January 2019 almost February and we did not see anything yet but finally they have been ich announce ich but they're supposed to come in the first half of 2019 so sorry they almost the second months so we should see them really shortly probably around before Julie's before June 30 that would be ideal but I'm not promising anything it's just pure speculation that some sources say but it also may come alongside the air power which may get pushed back to the beginning of June with WWDC where they will maybe announce air power the air pods and something like that so both of these things we're announced they're not dead so air power had not dead I talked about that in my previous video and now airports who are coming as you know many smart devices are on the rise and airports are kind of starting to be more and more but as well as the Apple watch and all of this it's starting to be more apparent around here and also health features are starting to be all over the place kind of trying to measure your heartbeats ECG and all that that's all good stuff so let's see what will be coming in airports sewage is really unclear but there is a lot of speculation around this there are many rumors about this but none of them are for certain but Apple may just start doing something with health in your air pots as they did something in your Apple watch this year I mean last year and just probably gonna focus a lot on health now health there may be just health monitoring features in airports - maybe heartbeat ECG but like I don't know how that would work but it would be really cool what may come is like a temperature measurement since you can measure your temperature from your ears you can probably use your air pods if you're sick to see how you're doing temperature-wise would be really cool to see in the new airports now this is just a lot of speculation there's not a lot of details about this but we may be seeing something about health in the new airports there's one thing going on that even Apple talked about in 2018 to have some kind of Pro headphones maybe in like pure headphones which would be great like studio quality for editing and so on Siri integrated or maybe there will be just a pro version of ear buds which will be pretty cool as well but what can we see maybe in the pro ear pods well we may see a lot of noise cancellation since the air pods first generation are not really noise cancelling so that's something we may see also water and sweat resistance would be really cool to see as well sometimes they just jump in the pool or something not happen to me though but I have many people which that happened to but it would be really cool it'd be really reasonable to do this kind of things and this would maybe be the second generation or there would be two generations or like two new airports like kind of like a basic version and like a pro version it'll be really cool but as well you know that Apple is kind of crazy with their prices sometimes and if they put pro after their name of the product it usually gets the price bumped up quite high so the price is a mystery as well they may be at $149 for the basic version and maybe even over 200 for the pro version it's just unknown so if you're excited for the new airports let me know in the comments I would really like to see that I am very excited you can see that probably I really am waiting for those because it's been a couple years now probably it's gonna have or something like that since the airports came and it'll be really cool to see some new airports but anyway these are coming hopefully by June probably there in WWDC but that's really I'm sure maybe they're gonna do an event before we don't know but yeah I'm excited I hope you are but if you enjoyed this video be sure to LIKE down below it's all greatly appreciated and don't forget to sub guy let's get to a thousand subscribers would be great and I'll talk to you guys later okay bye [Music] you
