hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I am very excited to present these amazing ear buds from acoustica that aren't available yet Steven the CEO of acoustica was so nice and sent out three of these ear buds version 1 version 2 and version 3 for me to review version 1 are the entry-level ear buds and version 3 are the professional level ear buds these ear buds come in six different colors here are the three I got green black and orange for those that love Wireless then you can purchase the Bluetooth accessory which will work with any version the regular version comes with a standard cable without any buttons however you can purchase a cable that allows you to adjust volume and answer / decline calls to my surprise these ear buds can have the cable replaced if it breaks instead of buying new ones but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and stuff like this before we do any of the reviewing we have to unbox these also side note I already tested these I just want to show the unboxing experience anyway here we go in this unboxing I will be unboxing the version one of the acoustica headphones so the unboxing is pretty straightforward just open the box here we go like this and you get greeted by this protective foam over here and a small packet here with a lip with your standard user guide and then if you dig further in you're going to find the headphones here they are so pretty straightforward unboxing the box is empty now and you can see that you get this is version one remember you get some of your replacement your parts your cups and your headphones right over here things get interesting in version two so by opening up the box we get greeted by something completely different keep in mind version one is the lowest e'er version here we get greeted by this box instead of the phone then pretty much the same case with your user guide and the headphones on the bottom so here's your standard box with your headphones your user guide and a whole box of these yes you get multiple sizes here instead of just the regular bag in version one so you get this in version one and you get all of this in version two the same applies for Version three so Version three will have the same boxes this except the quality will be a little bit better so here they are you can pull them out easily there you go by pushing them out and you can replace the cups and listen to some amazing music by acoustica well this unboxing experience was interesting but that is not the main point of this video now let's take a closer look at these earbuds first let's take a look at the specifications starting with version 1 we can see that their sensitivity is a whopping 105 decibels with a frequency response of 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz the other specifications aren't that important now version 2 has a sensitivity of 110 decibels with it the same frequency response and finally the highest level out of these has a sensitivity of 112 decibels with the same frequency response now some of you might be asking what does all of this mean that's a great question to simplify a little bit I will compare with Marshall headphones Marshall headphones have been one of the best I had so far until this day when I found these the highest tier of headphones from Marshall the monitor black has a maximum sensitivity of 96 decibels and a frequency response that is the same to ours however the more disables the better the sound quality so having 105 in the entry-level earbuds is way more than 96 decibels of the highest ear and Marshall all I can say is that they sound amazing I was looking for earbuds to edit with and I think I just found them however these are a part of the first production so anything might or might not change based on what Stephen the CEO of acoustica told me you should be able to buy these in the May of 2019 if you have any questions or want to purchase earbuds of high quality then visit WWI you still see a or just comment down below and I'll be more than happy to reply you can find the website in the description well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know if you'll be getting these in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and stuff like this okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
