hello everyone two weeks after the release of I was 13 beta 1 we get iOS 13 beta 2 we are going to take a look at some of the new features and changes battery life performance bugs and much more I was 13 beta 2 came with the profile whereas in the past you had to install it with an IP SW through your Mac it is a lot easier this time with the developer profile the update size about 692 megabytes on my iPhone XS coming from beta 1 but that may vary from which version you're coming from now if we head over into the Settings General About section click here you see there are build number is 17 a 5508 m and also another change is right over here if we go into the modem firmware as you can see we updates it to one point 51 point zero seven which should help with some connectivity issues if you've been having any in beta 1 now there is a lot of features I want to add all of them in this video there will be another video with more of them later on this week so the first thing I noticed is the ringer volume so if you have the ringer volume changing with your buttons then the whole interface up here will be changed look at it it's literally changing just like this ignore the noise but like it's doing the ringer up there whereas in the past it would be on this side this little sidebar so that's a new thing right over here now one thing that I love is if you go into your folder files app browse click the three dots in the corner you can connect to a server so you type your server so if you want to share files with the server or just copy files over there you can do this now whereas in the past it'll just give you a message then you cannot do that yeah that's super cool for easier workflow now 3d touch the very controversial topic so I discussed that in my previous videos but many people say a 3d touch is not completely here anymore and it might come back or it might not but since Apple is working on haptic touch they might as well give up on 3d touch but that is really known now one thing if you go into your camera app go into the portrait mode and you can select high key lights mono so we can take a picture right now I'm gonna take a picture of myself let's take a picture I took a picture it isn't the best picture on the planet but it works well for this video so what you can do here is also go to edit it's gonna load up the photo and you can edit the light for example which is really good so you can go a little lower a little higher more light and you can also change the effects to whatever you wanna have but for this example using high key moto now if we go into the music app there is an option of actually sharing with two different air pods so if you have your air pods you have a friend that has air pods you can just select that from this menu right over here very simple another thing if we head over back to the files app is that now you can use a PFS drives from the files up especially on your iPad which is really good one thing that I noticed was if you're a person who likes to set ringtones like custom ringtones whatever you want to do well it wasn't really working that well and it would always go to the default ringtone of the iPhone however now in beta 2 it is working the way it is supposed to also one thing that I love if you go into your control panel you can now 3d touch anywhere in the platter to open up the platter so in the past you have to click in the center and not on like an icon now you can just click wherever you want and it's gonna open it up without any problems these are some of the features I noticed and found people talking about but there are more which I will talk about later this week now let's go look at some of the bugs so the music app for me when I downloaded beta 2 would crash when opening it up now it's not doing that anymore but it'll crash a couple of times also if you were in your Settings app I noticed that sometimes you would be able to crash so of your settings so some of the panels in the setting couldn't be opened for example and stuff like that which would actually restart the whole Settings app but it's not in this beta anymore now if your phone will be locked then sometimes the flashlight and the camera wouldn't be showing up anymore also if you are using a controller to play games on your iPad the battery would drain very quickly and it would get very hot also in your messages app if you'd go into your emojis and me memo in emojis they don't even show up now but it would be really laggy over here so this whole keyboard section is quite laggy literally not very very good also in the mail app if you had any emails then the thing would be that you could not delete them from the Trash folder and so on now let's look at battery life well battery life hasn't been very good for me overall even this graph shows you last 24 hours the the battery would drain quite a lot and just usage of about 3.48 hours and it would be almost at zero which isn't a lot of battery life for a phone like this so it drains very quickly but that could be because the apps are not compatible fully yet or I don't know what's the problem but it's gonna be a software problem or an application problem now performance for me is very good it has been great now excluding apps that would crash compatibility wise in beta 1 when do you wouldn't load it would just crash but now it actually loads up which is great to see well that is everything for this video let me know if you are having any problems or bugs in the comments down below also if you want to see what came out in
