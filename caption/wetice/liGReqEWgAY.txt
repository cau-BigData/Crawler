good morning guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so today is another day and we are going to go to door knock through some weight points that we found that we made our plan at home and that means we need to get going so we're gonna pack up and take all of our craft of the car and we're on on the road well we just went for an hour just straight somewhere from the hotel from the bear lodge and now we want to go see the castle yield and I don't know where it is we we found our Waypoint what we said last night what we do every day but we cannot find it and we think it's got some kind of hotel but it doesn't look like it so we're confused and we're going to try to find it but so we get lost again [Music] well we actually did not find the castle even ask ask some people but this castle was not nowhere to be found even called the roses that nowhere to be found maybe they destroyed it or something but well we could not find it if they're gonna have to get this fine I'll cut it away to get this to say ok so the castle not found as I said previously so now we just continue the road and we arrive to some kind of shoreline place it looks really really nice around here and we're going to make me stop for coffee or tea or something like that and they just look around because here we are in front of me I think the Atlantic Ocean and it's really nice in supply the ocean I couple times a year but it is nice [Music] a thing I learned is that there's a wreck that is seen during low tide but it's not those type he yet so we don't see the right foot it's a nice place over here i can tell you i really small little stop over we just looked around it's a nice spot but we learned that it's only a restaurant and a food galley so we don't want to eat yet we're going to go eat only in like maybe one or two hours so we're going back to the car and maybe look at a castle that we look sounds on the map and we're going to visit it since to the first castle did not go well [Music] so we just went to look into a distillery it was a nice history right next to me go over there and very nice again this is our second distillery of the space I don't think we're going to look at any more but now let's go to to a castle to a castle and then we should be good then we're going to go to door know what we've been recommended for many people that it's a very nice very nice kind of city village with many things to see so we're going to see [Music] here we go we found some kind of nice what's around normal we're going to look at this literally you are our hotel look we found their hotels that's perfect it sorted out online yesterday stood here long 30 for the very large and now we're going to go to the council but probably before that we're going to have a lot because like 1230 already so anyway the plan every day changes like bedtime so yeah it's going to change many more times but this fair with us we tried to get some nice shots and stuff so let's continue [Music] Maya you know here we go we arrived at the castle of whatever castle it is i don't really know the name so this is done Robin castle and its really really nice it was recommended also by someone so we're going to walk around because they're really nice castle finally here [Music] so there's basically a fee for the castle for visiting 20 rooms inside of the castle what's kind of stupid and then also going to the garden so that's not really the best idea just won't visit only the outside area but we're going to try to maybe go look at it from a different angle or something but that's not really nice for them here we go walking through the forest Mousefur we somehow went to the forest maybe for a nice shot of the castle there are many trees but we're going to get a nice shot of the series right in front of me they're going to look at [Music] ok
