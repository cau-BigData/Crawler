life for recording the whole thing okay and I'm sorry for the lights because like my other window there broke so we are going to work with this gigantic mess here they said so I'm gonna just start with making it use my sis and it's like starts by this laptop I mean it's good I continue that so laptop out of the way now that's not all right um my desk is full of junk and okay let's undo this more there a job and I'm going to Mike move it out of the way and I don't even know how I'm going to put this Wow Oh careful careful you stole my car let's continue ah what else let's start with this junk on the table Oh we have a bajillion cables there a bajillion cables there and i giganti myself this is cool I don't even know what to say so I don't even know how to take off the dock like do it is do okay cable my charger for my laptop that's out that's good I know like I'm gonna see that nice there I want to kind of get rid of that cuz I don't like that kind of mess stuff okay let's get rid of that so we're doing a bunch of crap here now you monitor don't don't even start now over up in here with all these cables I don't know where to start like okay I can I kind of know where to start you can start to this cable here candesce cable go Oh guys this is going to be so much fun to do because there's so many cables to be plugged after this I don't even know if I'll be able to plug them that's the thing like I think I will that's overreacting I will know how to plug them except there's a gigantic mess now so you have this shelf empty now we just have the extension cable here but I need to get rid of this extension cable stays with the shell let's say whoa what what I'm breaking things already okay this shelf now can be moved hallelujah hallelujah mo this shelf wind up with that mess there I'm yeah so let's start messing with this No Oh we've got this here to take care of all this down there okay that down there we have to resolve all of this it's fun right all right now what you just need to do is they have this kind of pins up here so I can just do this this and then this bad idea oh no oh no I forgot something oh no oh no unplug all this I forgot the damn computer in here oh oh and screw this please oh my god it's so heavy oh let's continue with the fun now now I want interested in how the world did he do this oh cuz i had a friend helping me here and he plugged it I could like with two remotes turn my lights on and I never saw like how he did it so now I need to remember that i can plug it back Oh take more tape no space no go away okay huh this is starting to be a mess here yes I can remove mmm Oh Oh so I can remove all this stuff up here like this two keyboards and come on okay so i can take this mouth and keyword out that's my webcam okay webcam work them out webcam is out now and ha still many cables to go like I have a bunch of stuff on my table yet to go all right bunch of stuff on the desk still this is trash goes out on the floor now I'm going to take out this all these papers here all right let's pick this out this is gone also the desk is now empty only the microphone to go right so just have to unscrew the microphone off from here okay there we go microphones out it's good now we are on a good way now only the cables down but what I wants to say I have made some progress here and now it's time to turn the desk hopefully I can turn the desk without moving that shelf there I can just slide it in here we go turn it all trips its hands so am I sitting corner here okay I mean I like it look maybe we'll they may do is turn it around or I don't know i know i like it then I can like put stop here oh yeah let's go yeah like it I really like it now it's looking good but now the only thing we have to do that's not gonna need too much fun this removing the cables is fun putting the cables back is no fun and I don't even know where I'm gonna put the metal thing construction but I like my desk more like this I have kind of like to say see anything over here that means I like it yep but problemo n√∫mero uno where will I put like the small shelf hmm what do I do give me a moment to think I found what I like I'm going to like this looking in there going to be a lot cooler now so what i think i may do is put the shell that white one over there it's like behind me yep no I here and then I will do the small shell i would put next to me somewhere or else put it there behind and there will be all the cables and all the computers I like that and then it also solves for my screen now there it can be in the back here that's the best idea I've had in a very long time except what's complicated is hold up give me out of here is how in the world will I arrange all these cables of the screen and speakers to work and that they're kind of neatly in like a arrangement row that's gonna be fun okay but let me continue doing some stuff start to set up a few things maybe move this this shelf maybe move the shelf were there to the other side and start getting some things ready and done okay I'll be right back you're busy alright guys we are back here it's six right now pm and i'm doing the setup so i want to show you what I've done off-camera ok watch so I've put that shelf over there now as i said and i plug the LED lights to an automatic like but with a switch thingy so now it turns on when i push a button what is great so this shop is gonna be there and now i'm starting to work on this shelf over here this is the computer shelf that i was talking about and i think i'm going to put even that thing the whatchamacallit thing i'm going to put it also somewhere here i need to decide they are under the desk there that's what i need to do now crazy right uh I want to finish because I want to do some editing tonight but it's like a massive mess right now so if I'm gonna like make the editing computer work I'm gonna be very happy extremely happy right let's get into it oh whoa by the way one more thing hold up one more thing you probably did not even notice it perhaps all the cables behind that thing okay and have the internet cables coming now so all the way there that's cool i was messing with the internet cables a little bit because they're coming from the server room thing and i had like the shirt cable so i was messing with it up till now and also i was in the shop and i bought some some cool stuff here so i bought this kind of cube thing well thank camera I book tables i bought these in i'm gonna put all over here so i've managed the cables I put a I'm another what you call it led thing so all in all is going to be amazing I don't know where I'm gonna put the light thing it probably behind my desk or something or somewhere in that area I don't know yet all right i'll have to like use or check something that I'm gonna do it on okay let me get some cables plugged let me sort this little bit and i'll be back with another update okay see you in just a bit alright guys I have done some more progress here a lot of progress so I've installed all of these cables so it kind of attached the year okay they're all attached and this is kind of a call is the next zone but it'll have to be always anyways and they're all attached to the screams anyway so you know it's it's good i like it that's the point i find it really good right now i'm gonna do a test I just have to plug my laptop battery stuff and then I'm gonna start working on this computer down there okay guys so it's almost done now except of the sound that's the most annoying part but this here is good except I need to still call the keywords and all that junk but all this down here it's all good I really like it since it's all nicely and organized now and now the only thing is I turned on the computer i turn on my laptop oh ok hello hey there it's working now okay cue or does North this for sure but with some good news that it's working and that's I'm very happy that it breaks honestly because I spent another like half an hour hour plugging all the junk and I think even the other computer is plugged and ready to run I mean this one now I think it's ready to run now honestly but we're not done it's seven and oh my god I'm look look the stuff for disappearing from here slowly slowly now I'm gonna probably put my microphone now or I'm gonna do the sound now because that's like the most annoying part and then then finish off the details but now I want to put some music from my laptop to enjoy and finish it off okay so I'll see you just in a bit guys I finally finished the computers this one's working no and that I'm working down there everything is plugged except of the sound now and like all the LED lies and all the fun stuff and that's at the end I also put my microphone now over here that's good um and all this is yes here it's good now i have only one problem with the other computer but that's solvable i think that's that's pretty good for us now and now
