hello everybody welcome back to another geoguessr video this week super excited to go into this one because actually since you know that I live in Europe we're gonna play the European Union map so there's 28 countries I don't know all 28 countries but I know a few and I've been to a few of them so I kind of know a little bit what to expect but I'm not sure if it's gonna go the way anticipate in the average score is 18,000 so let's try to beat that all right we're in so I have no idea where we are reading by this this looks like Finland Sweden what is this flag I don't know what this not that's not a flag you know I'm gonna go with something like that I'm gonna go probably with Finland or something like that I have no idea yeah I'm just gonna go with Finland honestly that's gonna be the same oh my in the United States it's gonna be the safest bet I think near Helsinki near Helsinki just do it make a guess 4700 points it was actually in Tallinn so I mean not so far away just uh just a ferry ride let's say that's way so that's cool start alright rode on right closed so this is I think an english-speaking country even though okay I have no idea where we are though our window you I mean UK recently is exiting the yeah it is there sexting the European Union so I'm just gonna go with the UK still yeah because I think it's the UK but I don't know where we are and I'm gonna go near London I think I'm just gonna go near London that's the safest bed and safest option we have I'm pretty sure just make a guess alright 3,700 points it was actually in Glasgow so that's in Scotland um I should kind of have known that but I was never in Glasgow though I was in Edinburgh House of beer but though I'm gonna take that as the main example because it can just be a name wherever I mean is the Ukraine in the European Union I think that was like a thing we had last time but I think because like this language tells me something it's either the Czech Republic or Ukraine or I don't think it's Hungarian even though it's possible it can be eat the Czech Republic Poland I think I'm gonna go with Poland let's go near Warsaw or no let's go to Krakow that's a better man I think make a case no it was in Slovenia yeah that's one one country I forgot but 3600 points it's fine but I something told me about the language so 3,600 points is a good one let's just play the next round so this is the fourth round we're going through it quite quick this time because I kind of know where we are except this doesn't seem like they're you European Union too much you know I would like some writing or something to kind of see where we are this looked like it's kind of closed like we're in some weird suburbs I'm gonna go with Ukraine on this one because of this freighting here I think this could potentially be Ukraine near Kiev no yeah yeah maybe yeah let's do that make a guess no it oh yeah I mean I mean yeah it's kind of Greek was that Greek I don't know 20300 puts I mean I kind of thought that it'd be Ukraine because it's kind of in the middle but I guess I'm wrong dot s II Serbia I mean or Sweden I don't know what they are though I don't know what like the website code they have it's either Serbia or Sweden but I'm gonna go with Serbia since we never put Serbia ever so let's just try to put Serbia somewhere Belgrade yeah near Belgrade Serbia I think it's good maybe yes what Sweden yeah I mean that was a doubt that I had it was either Sweden or Serbia and actually it was Sweden so s e is Sweden that's good to know we're learning something new if you are summary we have 16,000 points so we're below average so we did not beat that so we're still following the trend that I'm always below average so anyway if you enjoyed this quick video actually it seemed like a quick video I don't know how it seemed for you but I hope you enjoyed this quick video leave a like and subscribe it would be greatly appreciated every single subscriber and every single like and do I get I appreciate so much so just do that please and I'll see you next time in another video bye
