what's up guys not only did Apple released the 20/20 iPhone se but iOS 13 point four point five beta to the public beta didn't get any update just yet which is very uncommon at this point but it might be coming tomorrow or sometime in the very near future so let's start with the update sighs the update came at about 190 megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max but of course this will vary depending on which device you have and from which software version you're coming from so if we head over into settings in general and the About section we can see that we're running 17 f50 for 40 so that's the build number and the D at the end means that we should expect at least a few more betas in the coming weeks probably with the full release of thirteen point four point five sometime in May now if we had a little lower we can see that the modem firmware is 1.0 6.0 0 which didn't change from the previous beta it's unchanged which very likely means that this update will not be that big or that very important so the biggest change here was that you are able to go to music and click here and share a song to your Instagram story so it's gonna create the story and go to Instagram and you can have it right here so now once it only once it's on your story basically what happens before you could not click on it be just a picture now you can actually click play on Apple music and you can go open Apple music and it's gonna take you directly to Apple music to the song that you wanted to share so one of the big fixes we had here in 13.4 point 5 beta 1 was the introduction where you could haptic touch go to bluetooth where in the past it would crash or it'll just open the main menu so this is fixed here of course and there should be no problem however many people are still reporting problems with random disconnects with Bluetooth were you using the air pods Pro I personally listen to music all the time from my iPhone and don't have this issue so let me know if you're still having this issue in the comments down below there have also been reports with the mail app that there are some problems again so you would get a notification and OH open your mail up but nothing would be there so I've been experiencing this issue throughout beta one very annoying and hopefully it's gonna be fixed here but I didn't have time to test that one out just yet another big buck that we had here was with the VPN so the VPN bug is still here it's not fixed basically it allows from for some data to not be encrypted when leaving your device which leaves you vulnerable so there is no indication if it's fixed here in beta 2 but we know that it wasn't fixed in beta 1 or thirteen point four point one so for now don't use the VPN on your iPhone or any related devices with the bug for the time being now what about performance and battery life so performance is quite good and it's a little bit faster compared to the previous beta but for me it doesn't seem to have any significant difference in daily usage but of course that depends on what you are going to be doing and which apps you are using so you might see a boost in some apps but not in general usage now regarding battery life battery life is quite good and I had no problems over the course of 13.4 of course it depends how much you use your phone I don't use it that much during the day so I can go with about two days on a hundred percent charge which is really good battery life now should you update well nothing really major changed besides the Instagram feature but many bugs were fixed and the performance is getting a little bit better so yeah you should update if you are in the developer program if not then just wait for the public releases that'll be coming quite often during the course of the following months so what about the future so if we head over into calendar we can see that we are on the 15th when it was released I was thirteen point four point five beta two and we should be seeing either thirteen point four point two next week on the week of the 20th as well as the shipping of the iPhone SD to under twenty-fourth we should be seeing that and there's also a possibility to see thirteen point four point five beta three next week but it's more likely going to be released on the week of the twenty seven well this is the end of the video if you enjoyed and please leave a like and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also follow me on Twitter for some more frequent updates and participation in polls and some really other fun stuff the link is in the description below on another note please click the card shown up there to watch my previous video okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you [Music]
