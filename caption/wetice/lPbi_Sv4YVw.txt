hello everyone and welcome back to another video I really like to share my one-week experience living in Hong Kong so far as it's been a little bit over a week but still it's been an amazing amazing adventure now of course I am lucky in the way that I'm in a hotel so I don't have to worry about going to buy all my supplies by myself at the moment but of course within the next month we're going to move into our new house and we're gonna have to start looking for all our home things by ourselves without anyone's help now of course for those which move to Hong Kong they generally go into an apartment immediately whereas me I'm staying in a hotel Wow the house is getting ready but if you're moving to a home really quickly then it's gonna be quite a hassle to find all your things like deodorant and toothpaste and things like that it's gonna be fun to go look of course if you're in the hotel you can always request toothpaste or deodorant the hotel is gonna bring it however you still have to go and look for yourself so that in the future you are able to buy things by yourself so there are five main points that I would like to cover in this video and those are the people the culture food how we Westerners are seen by the Chinese and by the Hong Kong citizens and kind of a little bit about the current situation if you're in the loop you know there's some protests going on and it's not really pleasant to be in the middle of it and then some kind of final thoughts and basically if you should move or not so starting off with the people the people are amazing in Hong Kong you're gonna discover that when you come here and when they see a westerner they're Westerner or foreign or whatever as a matter of fact they they like the people and I feel like Chinese are the people who are very friendly at least here in Hong Kong I didn't go to China mainland yet but in Hong Kong they are friendly helpful nice but of course with the people here in Chinese as the main language here in Hong Kong is Cantonese it's sometimes a hassle to be able to talk to those people especially if you go to like markets or things where people will not necessarily speak English however most of Hong Kong I would say 80 to 90% of the people in Hong Kong speak English so there's still majority speaking English and Cantonese but still I would say that would be a good idea to start learning Cantonese and he's just a little bit so that you can understand some things and get around your basic duties during the day now anyway back to the people they're very helpful very friendly you need help they're going to help you but of course you need to keep in mind that they work on Quincy which is basically the fact where when your friend so let's say I'm friends with a westerner who's a friend with a Chinese a very good friend that means that I will be the friend of the Chinese as well so friends go through friends it's all about trust and it's all about trust and helpfulness so when that Chinese person helps you then they expect that you can help them back in return when they will need it of course it's limited to the fact where you have to be able to do it like if you are not able to do something then it's okay however if you are able to do it then you have to do it that's how Quan C works in simple terms of course I'm not an expert but that's kind of what they explained to me now what about the culture so for us Westerners it's a shock so you first come here it's a shock everything is different they they speak a different language and and their culture is a lot different from the Western world now I don't want to go into detail just anywhere inside anyone or anything except it's just very different and you will blend in quite quickly you will be able to take some habits and of course for example they here they eat with chopsticks so if you don't know how to eat with chopsticks then that's maybe a good opportunity to learn so there are many things that are different but that you have to learn and usually they're quite lenient with how Westerners are with Chinese because they know that you don't necessarily know how their culture works at the beginning one popular question that is probably going to be is how is the the food is pretty good like its Asian cuisine so here in Hong Kong of course you can find many Western restaurants you can say in America and you can find Italian French whatever there's all the restaurants possible here of course the majority of them is street food so in Hong Kong it'll be like dim sum or things like that and they're really good they're actually really good as long as you like fish seafood meat all these kind of things vegetables then then you're okay then like you're gonna like the food of course your stomach isn't gonna be very happy about it at the beginning but overall you're going to be happy with the food it's excellent there's so much flavor so much good stuff however if you're the person that doesn't necessarily like Asian food because of course you can find Thai and Japanese and all these kind of foods around here but if you don't like Asian food then you're it's gonna be quite difficult because the Western world restaurants like the Italian ones French ones American ones and dadada will be quite pricey so you are gonna have to weigh the costs of prices because for Western they import usually quite a lot of the food which bumps up the cost whereas Chinese they bring it from Asia which is closer than Europe or the US now for the Westerners so if you're a foreigner or Westerner or most likely a westerner so let's say Great Britain from Europe or US or Canada or whatever people definitely tend to discriminate a little bit so not insulting anyone is in the metro I noticed just recently that if I sit down let's say the Metro is empty I sit down most Chinese will not come sit down next to me which for me was like I was at the beginning I was like okay that's fine and no problem but then I realized that actually the Chinese don't want to sit next to like an alien person I don't know how to feel about that however generally once you know the Chinese once you know that person usually they will be friendly and we'll be nice to you without discriminating you at all so I've made some friends here already some Chinese friends I'm Hong Kong people friends and you can really get a lot of details from them and you can really know how the culture works more so definitely try to join some groups with some Chinese as they can help you along the way as you don't necessarily know how everything works at the beginning now about the current situation so you know about the protest which have been going on for probably seven months or so it's quite a long time but I think the peak was in November where it really became nasty and now after the election it seems to be kind of there's a lot less people in the streets and I think it's a lot too calmer but still if you're signed up with China mobile or whatever operator in Hong Kong you're gonna get a message from the Hong Kong police telling you there's going to be a protest and you should avoid it in Dada so as I would say that as long as you avoid those areas of protests and don't get in the middle of the police and anything don't interfere with them then you'll be perfectly fine you will have no problems whatsoever and you can live your daily life as if you were in Europe now of course if you get stuck in that area let's say most of the time it's in central so if you get stuck in central you will most likely be stuck because they usually stop the transportation so you'll either have to go to a different metro station or figure something out but for example it happened to me in Mong Kok which is in Kowloon just a little bit further up and I walked all the way back to Victoria Harbour where my hotel was so you know it's just like if you know where it is and you don't have to go there like you don't have an appointment or something then don't go but if you really have to go then then I guess you have to go and just hope for the best now generally now in Hong Kong many metro stations are destroyed many streets are destroyed like it really looks like a kind of like a post-civil war thing like not to that point but kind of like you see that it's been destroy now Hong Kong is of course rebuilding all the metro station that were burned and it's trying to get back but I think that the protests will slowly wind down even though they're still present for example this weekend now the filming of this video there's a protest going on in central so I don't know it's really here amiss but tourists really like you're not gonna attack tourists most of the time I would say probably never because they need tourism here in Hong Kong and you can see that the economy is like going down so I don't know tourists I think you're fine here as long as you vote those areas as someone who wants to move in and come live to Hong Kong I think you're fine as well as long as you avoid those areas again so just follow this simple procedure don't go there unless you really have to go there that's it and of course don't interfere with the police don't try to fight with them don't try to be against them keep your opinions to yourself and don't try to get beaten up that's just don't get in the middle of it don't I really promise you it's not worth it alright so some final thoughts now about Hong Kong and living here I find it great so shopping is super easy in : you have shops everywhere food is like the easiest thing to find in Hong Kong you have street food which is like everywhere like almost every other shop is a restaurant so you can eat many things like that and especially if you like seafood since Hong Kong and this part of the world is close to sea so they eat a lot of fish a lot of seafood and things like that so it's really delicious it's full of flavor and and I think it's worth while now for someone who's moving the best tip I would say is try to make friends with the locals try to do that so that you can get some insight and become a better citizen here I think that's gonna help you for the future and definitely don't try to stick only with the Westerners so of course it's gonna be tempting as you want to have some Westerners but I promise you that the locals are really nice and can be really good friends as well alright well I hope you enjoyed video if you did then please leave a like and that's why that will let me know that
