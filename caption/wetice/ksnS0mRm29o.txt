hello everyone and welcome back to a new video today we are looking at I was thirteen point three point one beta three I'm so happy to be back doing iOS releases so we're gonna look at some new features and changes and of course the many bugs that are here the performance and Bachelet so if we start with the update size this here is incorrect as I didn't update for quite some time but the update is about 114 megabytes if you're updating on an iPhone 11 Pro max but of course this will vary based on the device and based on which version you're coming from now if we head over into settings and we go to general and about we can see that we're running 17 d50 v 0a the a at the end means that this version is almost ready for release but since we had an a in beta 2 this version is most likely going to be the GM build now if we head over a little lower we can see that the modem firmware has been updated just a little bit it went from 1.0 4.0 5 to 1.0 4.0 6 so this should help put any connectivity issues if you've had any but this version will be different depending on which device you have this version is only for the iPhone 11s now let's go look at some of the changes so one feature that has startled everyone is if we go into privacy location services we go over into system services and we have this networking and wireless this service here basically allows you to turn off tracking location tracking for Bluetooth Wi-Fi and the ultra wideband now you can turn it off of course but then it would limit some features so just keep it on or not but it shouldn't be sending your location anywhere so don't worry about that now there was one bug in the phone app in beta 2 which basically created an echo effect if you were on speaker on the phone with someone now this was supposedly fixed in beta 2 right but I don't think so at least from what I have heard and beta3 now seems to have fixed it as i didn't experience this issue now another feature that was added in 13.3 was in the screen time which basically allowed you to set communication limits for people you can communicate with during your downtime now there is a way to bypass this which basically doesn't make sense and shouldn't be here so hopefully it will be fixed in the coming betas now one issue was with notifications on the Apple watch so when you got a notification on your phone it should normally notify you on your watch but there was a 10 second or more delay between your phone and the watch which quite annoying right but I didn't experience that in beta 3 so far another bug was with Instagram and YouTube where basically if you were playing a video then you exited out I don't lock your phone came back it would still be playing in the background even if you were not in the app which would be very annoying for many people and it doesn't seem to be fixed just yet as I've experienced the issue just after updating another major issue was with iMessage where basically if your phone was locked you would not get the notifications on the home screen you'd have to go into the app which is quite bad and I didn't experience that in beta 3 after I tested it but it still could be here so let me know how it's working out for you now many people with the o2 carrier the phone carrier had bad connectivity on their iPhone X R so this raised many questions but unfortunately I cannot test this as I don't have the Otsuki riyer here in Hong Kong so if you have the o2 carrier and an iPhone XR let me know if the connectivity has gotten any better now if you would go into the Settings app and try searching for something let's say motion whatever and if you click on motion it previously would just go to the accessibility section and you would have to then go find where you actually want to go this was everywhere in settings which is quite annoying especially when you don't know where the specific setting that you're looking for is now regarding the performance and battery life the performance is very good for me I had no problems no lag no stutter and animations are smooth there really is no problem whatsoever but let me know how it's working out for you the battery life is excellent but of course this is a new phone so can't really say but last 10 days as you can see I've had some screen time definitely but the battery life has been quite good so my phone basically lasts two days until it depletes from a hundred percent which is quite amazing but of course this has a battery life of a beast now when should we be seeing the final release of iowa's thirteen point three point one I would say that it would be most likely next week as we got this release just this week so we should probably see it 27 to 31 that week and then we could see thirteen point four beta one a day after the final release of thirteen point three point one or in the first week of February well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed then please leave a like and
