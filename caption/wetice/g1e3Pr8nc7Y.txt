hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some new reports about the upcoming March 2019 event once you hear all these news you will be like what anyway if you are excited for this video then leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more we talked a lot in the past about the air pods - now there are two sources claiming that we should see air putts - on March 29th that means this month there is a new report by Apple's Fira about the upcoming airports - they are claiming to have seen a supply chain screenshot which had the airport's lifespan ending on March 28th this led them to the conclusion that air pots - should be coming on March 29th iPhone hellas reported this exact same thing but also saying that air power will be finally coming alongside the new air pods further many sources are claiming that Apple will actually hold this event so finally the different sources are agreeing on something however as they agree they disagree they are claiming that there are two different versions of air pods - on the table one could be just a small refresh - the ones we know today with the biggest feature being a wireless charging case these should also have the charging indicator moved to the top so that they can support a wireless charger this was originally promised by Apple in the fall of 2017 with the launch of the iPhone X in addition hands-free Siri could be coming as well based on the screenshot from nine to five Mac in iOS 12.2 also not to lose hope for color options completely black might be coming so with many sources agreeing this in fact could be the reality here comes the frustration the second version of air pods - that is on the table would maybe come in the fall of 2019 as previously said by on leaks in this tweet however these would have more color options improved sound quality with a focus on the base and you guessed it a higher price tag my smart price is reporting that these air pods should come out at about $200 $200 for stupid earbuds that is insane - adds to the frustration everyone is reporting something else the full version may or may not come in March during the event after all maybe on leaks was right saying that the full version will come in the fall of 2019 so at the end nothing is known but on the bright side air power should be finally coming and I am really looking forward to the hands-free Siri and the improved sound quality let's just hope it comes sooner than later but anyway I would love to read your thoughts and all of this in the comments down below also while you're down there then consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
