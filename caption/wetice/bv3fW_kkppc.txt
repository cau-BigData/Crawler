hello everyone and welcome back to another video we've got some exciting iOS 14 leaks from 9 to 5 Mac that has been really going crazy with iOS 14 code leaks we have a first look at the wallpapers as well as details on how the new features will work after months of thinking that the update will be quite small today we will see that it might not be that small after all one of the changes will be with the wallpapers in iOS 14 we have some leaked images from a twitter user called dongle Book Pro and all these leaks are real around mid-march we already got some leaked wallpapers from 9 to 5 Mac but today it actually is in the software however the big change here is that one of them is a blurred version of the wallpaper now this might not sound really crazy because you could also do it yourself but now you will be able to do it directly from the Settings app for each wallpaper you will be getting four new options a black a regular color a blurred version which is what Apple calls the smart gradient and the original image when this Apple is going to be creating a collection for your wallpapers organized in different categories from the leaked images we can see that we will have the default wallpapers classic stripes earth and moon and flowers but this introduction is mainly because third-party wallpapers will be supported so it will make it easier for you to find the wallpapers you want further in wallpapers this year you might finally be able to set wallpapers in carplay 9 to 5 mac shared a screenshot of this change but what do you think let me know down in the comments on the topic of car play and cars 9 to 5 max shared that the iOS 14 code revealed that Apple is working closely with BMW and car key you will be able to store your car key in the wallet app and walk to the car and unlock it dongle book pro shared more about this showing how you'll be able to give specific permission to other people for example only access the trunk or the only in the car or access the car and drive it on top of all this nine to five max shared that the introduction of widgets is very likely going to happen if you own an iPad and you are on iPad a West then you will experience Apple's version of widgets but at the end of the day they aren't really that useful 9 to 5 Mac said that you'll be able to move widgets around just like you do with apps everyone has been asking for this for so many years so maybe Apple will finally listen and introduce this change this year moving on let's take a look at the find my app basically this app allows you to track your devices and Friends in iOS 14 after the release of air tags you will be able to track pretty much anything you put the tile tracker on further in iowa's 14 when you set up notifications you will be able to set when you get the notification particularly when something isn't going according to plan for example now you would receive a notification every time the person arrives and leaves a specific point but in I was 14 you will be able to only get a notification when the person leaves late or early basically you will be alerted if something is not better than usual what is even crazier is how augmented reality will work with the air tags and potentially with all other devices you will look around your home and a red balloon will pop up when you see the item you're looking for this will really change how we track our items and how much easier it will be for us to find them well this was a lot of fun and these are only a few of the things coming at the beginning of June WWDC 2020 is still planned and should be held at the beginning of June so we are about 2 months out from the iOS 14 release and that's really exciting if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music]
