hello everybody and welcome back to another video how are you today today's another great day to record some videos and today I'm going to make a video back to this this is the Google Oh many that we unboxed previously and it's been a couple weeks and I'm gonna talk about a little bit my experience and so on so it maybe even kind of compare it to the Amazon Alexa that I've been using previously for a couple months so just to kind of share the experience so first off as I said in the unboxing video I really love the design kind of like the texture on top it's really nice I really like how it looks the mute button on the bottom here it's also kind of interesting right here and everything is great so if you look at it the texture is really really nice and it's also really small and useful I mean I prefer it over the Amazon Alexa because it seems to have more of a realistic voice closer to Siri whereas Alexa has a more of a robot voice even though both of them are robots at least I think that that is I think both of them are robots maybe not but the Google home many sounds more of like a person so that's like a big plus for me since I use it a lot and I don't want kind of like a robot voice talking to me second the sound quality is a hundred times better than on the Amazon Alexa because I think the speaker is different whereas in the Amazon Alexa you just have like a big box and it's good let me let me show you the Amazon Alexa speaker is pretty much just this right around it whereas on the Google the whole thing is a speaker so that's really big positive now it seems like on a comparison that the Google hold men he is a little bit bigger but it's just sound quality and it's all about that and also I was like concerned when I got it that for example these buttons that are on the Amazon Alexa like the mute plus minus and so on will be missing but they're really not missing and on the Google how many they're just on top touching so it's I mean I guess it's just two different companies two different brands that do their own thing but the Google home money doesn't have an aux port so you cannot plug with your own speaker whereas the Amazon Alexa has one but I'm gonna compare that in more detail in a different video but as I mentioned in the worst features that when you plug this to a like external speaker it's speaking to the external speaker and you cannot switch so I mean I think I'll make a video about that about maybe like some future wishlist or something like that that would be cool but anyway back to the video I prefer this over that so in many many different ways I find the app a lot better you can find all the different brands that make the lights the whatever you have in your room that makes it smart or in your home you can just find it by scrolling or here you have to type you have to find this skill I mean it's interesting but it's not the best and I prefer the scrolling on this and the app just makes a little bit more sense than scrolling through all the skills on the Amazon Alexa kind of application so I mean it's both of them are really tied but I prefer the Google home many and maybe we'll see maybe Amazon echo dot three will come out and it will be completely different and better than Google home many but this is all I'm gonna say for now so if you enjoyed this video be should live like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll talk to you later all right take care and I'll see you next time okay bye you [Music]
