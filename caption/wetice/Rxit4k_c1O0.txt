hello guys welcome back to another video today is an exciting day we have some new iPhone exei rumors some leaked images and also yesterday Apple released the smart battery cases for iPhone XR XS and XS max so for all three iPhones you can go ahead now you can go buy your smart battery case it's on Apple all of them available in two colors white and black and there are $129 I was expecting the exert to have a lower price and then the XS little higher and the max to have the highest one but all of them cost the same amount of money and $129 so if you want to go ahead and buy yours just click the link down below that's right there so today this video we're going to take a look at the iPhone X I which we are seeing the second prototype image and it's six months ahead of schedule which is quite a lot of time and you can see that I'm really excited about this one because this one really has a lot more detail and a lot more showing for the new iPhone X I or 11 or whatever you want to call it if we look at the image here I have two images one is the first prototype the second one is the second prototype it's all written there I don't really like the first prototype it was kind of ugly with this kind of triple ish camera thing not very nice and the second design here is better but it's not the best either I don't really like it because it looks too much like an Android phone and I think that its iconic for Apple to have the camera on the side which is kind of like what they had for a very long time now so let's take a look at some of the rumors here so I'm gonna divide the list into both sides so we're gonna start with the front side of the iPhone the front side of the iPhone as you can see just from looking at the image it has a smaller notch which is really good because now the knotch is kind of big but that's supposed to change and it's supposed to be a nicer smaller knotch and therefore the speaker is little bit higher it's not in the middle anymore as you can see on the picture and the true that camera looks to be a little bit more condensed and looks to be little more hidden away and smaller that's something nice to see also one big thing that you can notice around the phone is that the bezel actually is smaller so on the iPhone XS if we do a side by side you see that the iPhone X s has actually a thicker bezel and the new leaked iPhone has a thinner vessel which is great okay let's look at the back now the back as you can see has a completely new design this is the second prototype we're seeing this can be for the XS the XR or the XS max I don't really know for which phone this is however as you can see that three cameras are in middle so there's one on the right one or the left and there's one in middle and the flash is a circular thing around third camera which is pretty cool but what I don't like is that the cameras are in middle which kind of makes it look too much like an Android phone and I think Apple should really keep their iconic design another thing we can see is that the iPhone has a glass back which is really nice I love the glass backs on the iPhone it makes it look kind of more premium ish and I don't really think that aluminium is gonna come back anytime soon because the glass just looks better and also the glass is really good there for wireless charging as I use wireless charging and Apple just wants to do their wireless charging with hopefully soon we're gonna see the air power so I think the glass back is a good idea anyway last thing on the picture the buttons are identical so there's no difference in the buttons there's two buttons on the side for your volume there's a mute button and then you have the power button on the side so nothing really changed there no big differences anyway these are all the main rumors these from on leaks and compare Raja these are the sources for this video and I really think they're trustworthy sources because I verified with different websites they all kind of talked about the same things so it's very possible that we're gonna be seeing this design or a different design in the 2019 iPhone but anyway lets me know what you think which one do you like better look at it now do you like the first prototype or the second prototype which one let me know in the comments down below but until then well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it's greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video hopefully more leaks soon yeah bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
