hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have a new very exciting report on iOS 13 we have never seen this many features confirmed at once in the past 9 to 5 Mac is bringing all this information which tells us that it is very reliable but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more the report starts off with dark mode we heard a lot about dark mode in the past and now we are hearing about it again according to nine-to-five Mac there will be a setting to toggle on and off the dark mode when you will toggle it it will change everything system-wide and not just a couple of apps let's look at the iPad we have been waiting for so long to get better iOS on the iPad and now we are hearing about some amazing things we should be getting windows on the iPad they will be pretty much like on the Mac which will make the iPad even more like a computer we should also be seeing depth indicators for the windows there also hasn't been a way to undo anything when writing something for example except for shaking the device that is kind of absurd in 2019 in I was 13 we should be seeing a way to undo and that will be by swiping left with three fingers on the keyboard to redo you will do the same thing but swipe to the right this will also make the iPad way better for writing Safari should be getting better as well we should get some new functionality and better speed while browsing the web's however there is not much detail about this just yet Safari will also automatically request desktop sites on the iPad for example instead of going to the app which can be frustrating sometimes font management is finally coming as well into iOS 13 there will be a whole panel specifically for fonts and it will be very easy to use and create funds what is really funny now is the fact that we are only halfway through the report there are so many things and so much to cover so let's get back into it the mail app will have some changes in the past we heard that there should be thread muting meaning you can mute a specific thread in the mail app on top of that today we learn that Apple is working on a sorting system for your mail your mail will be sorted into multiple categories like mail travel news tech and more there will also be a specific read later category I believe the mail app will become a lot better to use on a daily basis than it ever has been collaboration was added to pages a couple years ago and now we are hearing that Apple will add this to more apps however there is no exact information on this the iPad will have some new gestures but those are mostly unclear yet however we could be seeing one where you could drive getting drop files that will be very very cool don't worry we are almost at the end of the report we should be seeing a new volume HUD which is great and this is something that is pretty much confirmed as well hands-free series should have less noise rejection and should know when you're actually summoning her there will be better by language support and better an app printing controls this report was so detailed and gave so many examples that begs the question if this report was not released intentionally by Apple we have never seen a leak of this many features for iOS ever I was 13 looks like it's gonna be a big one but for that we'll have to wait until June of 2019 well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about the new features and if you are excited for iOS 13 in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
