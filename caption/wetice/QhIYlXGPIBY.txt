hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today we are going to look at some of the dumbest tweets ever tweeted because some of them are dumb that makes absolutely no sense since I just said they're the dumbest way okay yeah let's just look at them and see if you would tweet something like that number one I want my first daughter to be a girl what why just click please don't do this if you want your friend daughter to be a girl a doctor is a girl son is a boy so just good job on that freaky geek my shirt says what's up in Arabic this is not in Arabic that is French and it's hello no this is not kill myself I hate how Nintendo still does this with download codes now I have to put this long as code in yeah I just posted on Twitter and and now his next tweet was you guys my code doesn't work that was a $50 yup ETA Hrothgar card god damn it okay whatever Aisha whatever I don't know I don't know you don't post your called children don't do that because then someone's going to be quicker than you are and he's going to use the code ha ha ha this one made a mistake because how did the on-state up and go hashtag one in 100 countries where there are only 7 so he has mistaken his confidence and his country you should go back to school you should go play you should go back to school and learn about countries countenance that that's going to be a good idea oh so he's sick of the US government and he's moving to California yes he doesn't want to be many wet so he moved to California and he doesn't need to be bothered by the US government great job here you're so smart so so smart he is going to stop smoking for a week because he feels bad for his liver he feels sorry for his labor so it didn't stop smoking for just a week and then he's going to restart and then his livers going to be sad again that's just some logic for you this is another smart person over here on Twitter finally got my debit card love the blue so you just put your number of your credit card debit card whatever and then the back code of my car did it three eight eight why is everyone asking you you're so dumb because like someone can just literally go buy stuff from your cards when you post it on Twitter here it's so smart just go away I had to cancel my old debit card apparently someone else was using it whatever this one is cute too so she doesn't understand the thing the fact that someone else was using her credit card debit card because she gave all the information and again she posed another credit card debit why do I keep sacred debit card and yes maybe maybe she did not tell them the code on the back anymore and that way she saved hopefully well I don't know did you like no I don't think you can say something without the on the back so okay but that's just stupid some people just don't do that children but this will do it for this video if you enjoyed visually like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and until next time take care and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
