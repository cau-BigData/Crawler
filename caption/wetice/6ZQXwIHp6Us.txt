hello everybody today we're going to be talking about the very popular question that there is should I upgrade from my Apple watch Series 3 to the series 4 or should I get this series 4 if I don't have any sort of watch from Apple now the series 4 has introduced many new changes and small features that are all over the place so let me just talk about that the series 4 is completely improved it is a beautiful new watch and it will be actually the first watch they'll be purchasing from Apple so I'm really excited to talk about this one a big change here is that the Apple watch for has a seamless edge to edge display compared to the other series 3 which has which is not edge to edge and it's 30% larger in this play size compared to the series 3 now the display therefore is 40 millimeters and 44 millimeters these are your options whereas previously there were 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters so I guess you get a nice increase in this play now of course it has a better resolution and it has an LT peel OLED display which is a nice change in the display going to a Knowland the new s4 chip with improved performance so I guess it can do many new other things and and and just I mean we're called vector and smooth areas they improve the cellular section due to some kind of ceramic back and the radio waves can like pass through a lot better which is I mean as I guess it's better and the speaker is 50% louder and they moved the microphone to the other side which both of these are better for phone calls if you're doing those kind of things on your Apple watch I mean what very little change is that you have haptic feedback on the crown so when you're just turning it you feel it to browsing the other kind of windows you have open and in the applications now a big change is the health which actually the Apple watch was based on I believe is that it has the ECG electrocardiogram which has been fda-approved so you can take an electrocardiogram from your wrist which is quite impressive and then you can go to your doctor with the chart you get and you can shrug that you have a problem and it also shows if you have a low heart rate or a high heart rate or if you're in atrial fibrillation so it can really detect all those and with that it also has a fall detection so if you fall it's gonna measure up to 32 g-forces and and different kind of Falls that you can see and it will automatically call the emergency services after a minute if you don't reply to the watch so if there's no response it's just going to call the emergency services send them the location and they're going to come save you which is positive write it as well has the b2 5.0 upgrade which it previously had the 4.2 so I guess you get a better Bluetooth connectivity with your with your phone and with your air pods so I guess that's it's good the battery life is the same except there's one improvement which you can have six hours of battery in workout mode so that's an improvement so your battery's gonna last about 18 hours basically the whole day unless you're awake 24 hours but I guess you have to sleep as well so 18 hours is a good battery life they kept it the same and just a small upgrade now should you upgrade from your current Apple watch Series 3 or should you get B series 4 if you're looking for an Apple watch yes I believe so if you're gonna get the ECG the heart measuring fall detection better crown better display better resolution so I would go for it get it it's starting at 399 dollars so it can go all the way up to I believe about $600 but you don't have to get the top watch you can really get the 40 millimeters with LTE or it really depends what you want to do and the series 3 is starting at $279 so for those who don't really want to spend the extra cash can just stay with the series 3 and maybe wait till next year or maybe not buy an Apple watch this year save your money for the Apple watch series 5 anyway for me it's really worth it to upgrade it I will get this series for I did not have a series 3 so that's something I want to do and it's gonna be I mean I think it's going to be a nice experience but anyway this is it for this video if you enjoyed be she like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time okay bye
