hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at Iowa's 13.3 developer beta 3 that came out just a week after beta 2 we're going to take a look at the new changes the performance the battery life and some bugs that we have seen here alright let's get into this video so the first thing we're gonna take a look at is the update size which is about one hundred eighty eight point eight megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max now this will vary depending on which software version you're coming from and on which device you're updating so that varies but if you went from thirteen point three beta to 2 beta 3 it should be around 118 megabytes now if we head over into settings and general and the About section and tap here we're gonna see that we're running 17 C 5 0 4 6 a of course that's the build number and again we have an a at the end which means that the final release is coming very very very soon so probably within the next couple of weeks so if we head down a little lower are gonna see that a modem firmware has been updated from 1.0 3.09 to 103.7 so this should of course help with any connectivity issues if you've been having any but I personally didn't have any whatsoever in beta 2 so beta 3 will most likely remain the same but some people were reporting that Wi-Fi has been disconnecting and not working really well so if you've been having issues then hopefully this modem firmware will fix that for you so there is one change in regards to trimming video so let's head over into photos and I made this video of the table I have right over here and so if you want to go trim it we just click Edit and we want to trim or right over here so let's just keep the first three seconds no one really cares and then when you click done it's going to ask you if you want to save a video or save video as a new clip now what does this mean well save video it means that it's gonna save the video the way it is now or you can save the video as a new clip the edited clip so you can keep the original and you can keep the new one so this change was introduced in iOS 12 originally but now it came back in I was thirteen point three of course is not available in the previous versions only thirteen point three beta three and above now the rest in this update are mostly bug fixes security enhancements and much more like that now let's take a look at a few of the bugs so male app has many bugs since the beginning of all of this so there has been a ton of bugs in the mail especially when you would be in the notification center and you tap on it it will just delete all of them and you could not go back to the notification center and there are still a few bugs of course but I feel like in beta 3 I just set it out a little bit it feels like the bugs are less visible and I think most of them are fixed now also in iMessage attachments are now showing up properly which is great the effects in iMessage are now working properly as well so you see you have the balloons you have the confetti and a bunch of these these in the past we're not working properly and now they're working really well so at least that's fixed now if we head over into settings and get out of here and go to settings we are in general and then we go into airplay and handoff transferring to home pod now seems to be working I own a home pod and when I was transferring in the past I had to most of the time go into the control center and then just like select where I wanted to airplay now it works actually better so you know that with the home pod you just bring your phone close to it and normally it should transfer by itself also the location services I can that would be present here on many people's devices non-stop whether you would disable location services or leave them on or whatever it would still stay here which was quite annoying for many people now I didn't have this particular bug on my device I never noticed it but many people are reporting this even in - so now it seems to have been fixed I don't really know so if you know then please leave a comment down below to tell me if this was fixed now if we head over into battery life battery life has been amazing throughout the whole process of 13.3 I have no complaints whatsoever but of course my battery health is it a hundred percent so this phone is new as you can see I don't use my phone a ton during the day but still I run a very good battery life throughout the whole thing and now some days I can use my phone quite a lot for example here last Saturday I used my phone for about five hours and I used less than 50% of battery which is quite very good now some people report having problems with battery life on their iPhone 7 8 + X now that might be because your battery health has decreased or it's just that uh you should probably update and maybe see if it it will fix things for you now in regards to performance performance is very good it's very smooth there are not any problems the animations work really well I really have no problem whatsoever it seems to work quite well now there is a little bit of lag and some third-party apps aren't really working properly but that's on their side to fix it but otherwise I have no problems whatsoever so should you update yes I would update if you have bugs and problems with connectivity and problems all around this beta version should fix some things for you however if you have no issues whatsoever and you're very happy with beta 2 then just stick around for a little while longer and then you can update to the final release which I believe should come around next week or the week after so it should be very very soon well this is the end of the video so I hope you enjoyed if you didn't please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these and if you missed out my previous video then please click the card shown in the corner up there alright take care and I'll see you my next video bye [Music] you
