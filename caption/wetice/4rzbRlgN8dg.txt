hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at Iowa's thirteen beta seven that has just been released to the registered developers now the public beta should be receiving it very soon in the form of beta six we are also seeing that the changes and new features are slowing down we're gonna take a look at this in this video so as always at the beginning we're gonna start off going to Settings General About section clicking over here to see the software version which is seventeen a 55 65 B the letter at the end changed by going to be now one thing that I find really interesting in here is that last time we update it to modem firmware to zero zero zero one but now there is a minus two at the end I have no clue what this means absolutely no clue what does a minus to mean now this update came in at about 321 megabytes which is smaller than the previous size let's go take a look at the new changes in features that we've got in this beta the first thing that I noticed is 3d touch and haptic touch which is better and faster if you'd see how responsive it is you can understand what I'm talking about maybe video doesn't do justice but it is super fast they don't even have to do almost anything and it works that's how smooth it is now while on the topic of 3d touch you can now 3d touch and drag let me show you how that works so if we 3d touch the calculator I can swipe up to go to rearrange apps and then start moving it directly that's how you can do it you could put it in a folder immediately the folders used to be really transparent as you can see in this screenshot it really blended with the color however now now it actually doesn't look that way as you can see it has more of a blur in the back than it did before the home app wallpapers are back so if you go into so if you go into the home thingy and go to the choose from existing the basic home ones are back they were not here in the past now they are actually back which is cool to see for those that wanted those also on that if you remember dynamic wallpapers look like this in the past with nothing to see however now if we go into settings exit from all of this get into wallpaper create new wallpaper and go into dynamics we can see that it's actually working now as you can see these are back however there are no new ones in dynamics in stills and the live ones are from this year from the iPhone 6 line up another thing that I noticed is in the past you would see or right over here that it would say dark appearance off this is how it would say it in the past now if we go into the control panel we go into the brightness as against he just says on and off so this is a big difference there where I think it was a bug or something like that now in screen time if we head over to our favorite application screen time to see how much you've been using it we can go to see all activity and we're gonna see that it actually shows you the day and this is kind of the week on top and highlighting the current day and if you click on that it will show you the whole week with all the averages and all of that so it's really interesting to see what you've been using the most now in the shortcuts app the automation tab is still not here it is still not here I don't use sword shortcuts that much but for people that use these often I think that's quite annoying now what Apple promised during WWDC when they announced this software they said that smaller apps faster apps and less sized updates will be coming to the iPhone now they are actually here however to get it to work you have to actually reinstall every single application on your phone so Apple someone over at Apple's said that you can just restore your phone and that works the same way however I find that really time-consuming and really annoying for this iowa's 13 feature now iPad OS so this is iPad OS 7 and nothing really changed over here we were running iPad OS 7 and I don't really see a big difference there might be just some tweaks but nothing really special in this version we can see that there are really less and less features now as we are approaching and we are in beta seven already however we had six betas filled with features which is a really great now battery life for me is really good on the iPad pro however on the iPad it could be better there are some days where it's good and some days where it's bad but it probably depends on the usage performance wise it is extremely fast there's no lags no stutters and it's working or really well and is very reliable in animation well this is the end for beta 7 I hope you learned something new and enjoy this video and if you did then hit that like button and subscribe for more videos like this also if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
