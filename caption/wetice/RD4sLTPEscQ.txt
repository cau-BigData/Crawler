hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are talking about iOS 14 already I know it's very early but we have some exciting news to look at of course many things can still change as we are one year away but just wait for it we have mark gurmann from Bloomberg giving us some news which makes it a believable as he has an incredible track record and almost everything he claims will most likely happen so that's why I believe in all of these news now the first rumor Frey was 14 is 5g support it will be coming to the iPhone in 2020 so naturally Apple will make the software compatible and optimized for 5g 5 Z will be up to 10 times faster than 4G which will be great the second thing you should know is the codename I love these code names iOS 13's codename was UConn but iOS for teens will be Azul which is quite interesting it might be something significant or it might not mean anything at all and the third final thing is that there will be more ar features ar has been a focus for Apple for quite some time now since I was 11 ar has been getting better and it will be very interesting to see what will come in I was 14 however I find myself not using AR on a daily basis am I the only one let me know in the comments down below now some speculation that I heard going around we were hearing rumors about a homescreen redesigning I was 13 but it didn't come that's why it actually might be coming in iOS 14 but of course this is a lot of speculation no one confirmed any of this also you might have noticed that Apple is paying more attention to detail so we might be seeing new icons new widgets or redesign homescreen and much much more in iOS 14 if you remember iOS 7 brought a massive redesign to the whole phone and iOS itself and now we are six years later so 7 might mean that we will follow the same trend well let me know what you think about this do you think Apple will not do anything big or do you think they will do something massive and repeat like an Iowa 7 it all over again the 20/20 iPhones will be updated even more than the 2019 iPhones which means that Apple could be getting ready for something big but we don't know yet and as I mentioned earlier this is a lot of speculation that I heard going around well this is it let me know what you think about all of this in the comments down below also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here in this right corner but before you do please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
