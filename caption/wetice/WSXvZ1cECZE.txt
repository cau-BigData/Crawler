hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today let me know as always today is a fun day because today I'm going to talk about my favorite Canon 100d accessories now probably the accessories that I chose as my favorites will be supported by other Canon series cameras so I think these are kind of useful even for other cameras but so far I only have the 100 D so I'm going to talk about the accessory now number one accessory that I really recommend that you buy is this this is a really really great thing essentially what this does it charges two batteries at the exact same time so that way you don't have to wait for the battery to charge one by one because as you know with the camera you get a charger but it's for one night at a time so this really really helps me if I need to charge batteries really quickly in the evening or whatever I need to charge them I charged to it one instead of one so that's perfect number two as I said this is probably used on every microphone for whatever camera it's this kind of fluffy thing I like I like to call it the flush thing because it's really fluffy but what I want it does it protects the microphone from win so it's pasta so basically then you don't hear the wind sound in your microphone what's a really really good thing because that's like your rape and stuff it's horrible to listen to the sound of the wind blown into the microphone and having the headphones at the same time again something that can be used on all cameras of Canon of course of its a less so well dog you can use it on all of the cameras but this lens if every this is the 10 to 18 millimeters Canon lens which is extremely great for making love but I don't anymore anymore so much of the 100 D since I reflected with the g7 X but whenever I want to use like super ultra wide lens this is the perfect perfect thing really the only - then I would say about it it's not very well working in low light so I think it's like where I think it's written over here I'll tell you it's a as you can see it's written up there it's a four point five to five point six so that's not really good for low-light performance but whenever you have a crackdown of life then this lens you'll be very happy with it this again this can be used for all photographers for whatever cameras not only for Canon of course and you may be surprised right now but this is the perfect thing to put SD cards in this is like the best thing and I have it upside down there you go this is the best thing ever you have all of your SD cards on one spot on hand in your pocket wherever stored in like a waterproof case I think even where they cannot get wet and stuff so I think and stuff okay but that's a really big plus to carry around because you have everything on spot of course you have two SD card in your cameras if you have two cameras and then you have the rest of them in here just in case with you if you need them this is a plus you take a lot of footage you take a lot of pictures this will save your day to have this with you this will be kind of an obvious one but don't forget about them when I'm talking about them let me just make like a smaller poll our batteries now this may be overkill batteries common one two three four five six seven plus ahead and eight I think at nine whatever I have a lot of batteries and what I'm saying to charge them that's where this accessory comes in where you can charge all the batteries quickly and efficiently they charge well fast that's perfect so overkill batteries neighbor will hurt anyone of course when you shoot a lot this 100 B takes so much power I don't understand it just takes so much that whenever I shoot I like an hour for battery or something like that I don't know I were two hours for battery and whenever you shoot all day you go easily to four or five batteries so I'm not talking that that's crazy but that's why overkill batteries are always good to have on but this is not it the last thing is the microphone was a road I know what number it's on Amazon you'll find in one of the first kind of red thingy whatever I'm using it right now to record my audio so as you can see you here if it's good or not me I think it's quite good and if you don't like it then well there are different models of the rode microphone but overall it's a great microphone that's for an affordable price it's in like it's like a hundred dollars or something like that it's not in like the top tier microphone but it's a good one for for an affordable price so that's pretty much it so this is good for this video if you enjoyed visually like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future thanks for watching take care and I'll see you in my next video goodbye Jesus bye [Music]
