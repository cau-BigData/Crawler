hey guys and welcome to a brand new series as you can see we are playing cities skylines and I want you to after this video if you enjoyed it of course leave a like but for in the comments down below tell me if you want I continue or not and if you're enjoying it ok so let me know that so let's just get into it let's just start your quick um let's see what we have lagoon shore I'm like going towards which one was it two rivers oh I forgot let's just the islands no this one is sixty percent area okay for building yeah we can let's take this one okay like Valley what should we name it let's name it wet wet ville something whatever start so let this load up this game is amazing I I played like for a while on it um I really liked it so I just wanted to kind of play it with you guys and we're gonna try to make a good efficient City um we're gonna see how that goes I would not want to some do some a lot of pollution but you know we'll see how that goes okay we're in so hello okay whatever I read that so this is basically our area where we can build can I go up okay like this so this is where this is like the the square where we can build for now and of course then you can expand I think yeah once you unlock lines you can expand okay so that but that's later on okay of course build roads ok so now let's what's here is that is the train station or something okay  so let's just start with some residents of course because there's a high demand let's just pause the time okay let's just get normal to one two lane road ok let's just see and let's not make too much ok let's just make that for now and let's just make let's just connect this up k that they had way out and waiting and this is enough for now okay we don't need so many residents at the beginning so now if I kind of zoned this up a little bit here then I believe some citizens will move in but of course they need watch in fact let's wait until some moving let's just speed up the time a little bit and let's see what's going on so we are of course in the minus that's that's normal so there is one guy building here is your building no that's a tree okay there are some people starting to build here okay so that's that's cool we have few people building here not here yet but that's good but they have no electricity they have nothing okay so pause the time of course now electricity we have a wind turbine what's I don't think very smart idea where this upkeep 560 and upkeep 88 megawatts 40 I think we will have to do a coal power plant for the beginning at least so what I have to do maybe is make like a small road going a little bit further out you know and just put the coal power plant here okay it's going to cause noise pollution around here but for now we will have to deal with that because residents it's here so I think it should be ok for the beginning um so now they have electricity technically but what I will do is run a small line like so just for the moment um because you know that they have power here this one I think should have power now right okay they have power that's good and now watcher so there is some watch over here but let's put it as close as we can this is the closest let's see where's our lens this is the furthest i think we have to put it somewhere here so let's just put one like here maybe somehow okay let's just do that so we have a small power thing in here but this will need power so we're gonna take care of that shortly but let's just run a small others disgusting me let's just run that for now okay to have water electricity now just here I don't have upkeep 80 I don't know if it's like worth it or not but let's just do this for the moment okay there we go and let's run run the study a little bit faster okay of course the money is going down but now these people are starting to find water and electricity so more people move in more money we make okay now they want shops commercials stuff okay we're gaining people now now all of them have a waste problem of course right um so for now we'll have to be dumping the waste over here so I'm gonna put it here uh-huh because the water stream is going this way so all the dump that we put out it's going to go through here so that's okay now this it needs a connection to to this right know how I could connect didn't I connect him oh my god let's see just break that okay and connect that okay and now let's run it so now the waist is starting to go out right ok but so it's just that's going out now where people are moving in right so we need more people now commercials going up so we'll have to put some commercial in here shortly for all the people the money is going down or up down okay but for now that that's what it has to be now let's slow the time down a little bit and let me see because now the electricity it's all here okay so i can i can remove this remove it hello because you know now there's electricity and people don't need this in their backyard hello okay and one more ok so now this is good now there's power over here to close all that let's just put the shops hmm let's put this shop this and I guess we're just gonna have to put them let's put a few here okay here but do I have to like move these let's just move that and just put some some in here like so that's good enough and now they will move in a little bit and that should be good enough okay money is going from the minus slowly up that's good but of course you cannot expect to have it immediately so we're gonna have some business over here what's what's good and I guess Wow lightning Oh but we'll have to put industry because you don't have zones from the beginning so we'll have to put some industry somewhere away and then we're gonna remove it you know because I this city I want well it's raining so much this is something new because last time I was playing they did not have this but let's just do a roll here okay and put some industry okay some industry here and not no no not not so close to the residence because this makes some pollution and we don't want pollution near your the people right so what should they have like just II they have so that's that's good for now now let's just feed the time a little bit up and let's see our zones here so some industry is moving in we are 600 in Los but it's going up to the plus what's good because we need to make some money now no one is sick yet that's that's a good thing and 277 people it's going up that's good now industry is quite high and is this full already now I don't want to grow my city very fast okay I just want to get it to a stable position you know make some money and all of that and then we can move forward a little bit but let's go slowly all right now I need hello no more industry what oh okay huh let's just put it here okay now that's okay are our industry is okay now oh there's it's polluting here but that's not a big problem for now it's not close to the residence so I'm okay with that now watch sure we have enough for dumping all the fluid so that's that's great right now this rain oh my god okay so we have people and I think see zooms in let's just zoom in on the house it looks nice look at it's cool there there's not a lot of traffic okay just some parked over here that's good not so much traffic but residents is going up and it's going very very high so I guess we'll have congratulations little hamlet ok so we reach the population of 400 so now we have a landfill site healthcare education garbage loans taxes okay that's cool what's the next thing worth the village so 400 the way we are okay then power okay policies and and forestry specialization and agriculture specialization so we're gonna do that once we have 800 people because I don't want to have all this pollution and and it's quite good because you know it's okay now these need workers okay so that's an issue they need workers so what we're going to do we're going to put more residence inn so I guess we should just carry it on towards the watch over here okay like so now now why what's here you're not happy about roads right okay so let's just put some here now there's watcher that's good okay now residents can move in so no demands except president okay now money is going up thats that's good we need to get some kind of stable spot where we can expand and build some stuff that's that's what we need right now will this rain ever stop here is it stopping maybe okay so now these guys as you can see they're polluting the ground a little bit but here i can go and where's pollution this is what garbage um what's this pollution so as you can see the pollution is very high here well of course around the industry but you know average ground pollution five percent so we're okay on that and that's not a big problem now residence is still high even though I put some residents here but they're moving in so that should go down a little faster okay now of course industry next episode we're going to move it probably on to agriculture that we don't have so much pollution air city okay let's see they are starting to have a trash problem I knew it so now of course trash also causes pollution and now we don't have incinerators us that's at 6,500 people oh my god that's that's a lot of people so for now of course we need to put a landfill what's this that's like noise pollution must be placed on the roadside and where do you think I am let's just put it here okay 4000 let's put it there and now garbage trucks are gonna go um and they are going to pick up our trash for from our citizens okay so now the trash should be okay for now I guess see I trash is yeah all of this is that's good okay our city is now crash proof now they're gonna pick up this guy garbages balled up okay there are trash trucks coming so hold on okay many trash trucks are here this one is okay there that's good now the next thing is no one is sick yet right six citizens to but we don't need to worry about that yet right and let's make my black small screen shot here that looks really really nice here to fit through this move the mouse away oh hello f12 i believe is a screenshot yeah he's getting shot saved okay cool now are we making money or are we losing we are making a little bit of money but that's enough for our small city and it's quite a lot from a small city right now now 600 people so 200 more people to go until all we can have some agriculture now as you can see we have these power lines here blocking some backyards what's not so very nice right um I need to demolish this okay that now let me see the power how it's going ok so we still need these this small thing in here actually what i could do is put some commercial here and then I could oh yeah because the commercial is quite high also let's close that off and I think once they move in here we can remove the power line okay I think this should be okay now right if I remove that yeah now and now it's covered so we can remove all the power lines over here because we don't care about them anymore cuz now it's all connected by houses because in city skylines the house is kind of like pass electricity as they go so you don't have to have power lines to each of them of course right now where it's nice city so far we are losing money no you need to be very careful to start because once if you if you are at a minus for too long on the start then it's a problem right now so far we are making money so that's not a problem but when I was playing like when I was testing around here my head many like I had to restart the city because basically I expand it too fast and just that messed up stuff okay so be really careful now as you can see residentials again going I but I don't want to put too many because then industry will go up and you know so let's just make like a small street I guess it's going straight like this oh no no no no let's just go like from here okay a small tiny strips like that that's good and we can put some some residents in here but we're missing watching of course you run it in the road it's not even straight okay that's good now it's pretty little thing in here I'm looking for an apartment okay well I don't care about you so now these houses are moving in of course we are we lost some money because of the pipes of course new service I know that there are hospitals but I don't need them right now now these citizens are moving in that's good and all we can look at this economy so income how does this work um I think okay this is the budget for each service we have here uh-huh okay let me see because that's good income expenses so income from industries for hunt worthy village here we go okay that's cool but anyway guys we're gonna end it off here once they're there we go we reach to worth your village we're gonna end it off over here and next episode we are let's pause the time next episode we are going to continue our our small city / village so far here and we're gonna remove the industry and try to put some agriculture without losing too much money of course right because you know that's why I try today to get some some money in the stock here with 65,000 so far what'swhat's okay for now but yeah I'll next episode industry of Agriculture probably somewhere from here because agriculture doesn't you know produce all the pollution and all of that so we can have it mixed in in residential zones and all of that so that's a really cool thing and you know that's the best thing you can have in your city because when I was starting my city I basically mixed in some some pollution and I was just expanding this dirty industry what's what's disgusting over here and it causes pollution of course this watch Michael landfill will also cause pollution that's normal right but um but yeah but that's what we have so we have a school now we have a police department fire department so we're going to take care of that later on but now let's get making a thousand whatever I don't know dollars what's that sign I don't know but yeah anyway guys if you enjoyed this episode please leave a like and subscribe it really helps out
