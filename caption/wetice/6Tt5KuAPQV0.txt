hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video now okay I'm gonna say this again because I'm gonna probably say that I'm doing this intro for like the millionth time this is my face try on doing this intro I don't know why but hopefully this time not gonna mess up anyways today the topic of the video is you know I've been getting some positive feedback on my review video so I decided that I'm gonna come with another review video it's not bad right if I do another review video you guys enjoy them so I should probably continue doing them and I have many ideas for them today we're going to review the Apple TV you will see now here on the bottom that I have the small Apple TV so this is the Apple TV this is the small little thing the Apple TV so it's really nothing is so small but if I compare it but smooth is and if I compare it it's like my hand it's like my hand it's really that small like my hand it's very small very very small now so this is the whole box okay this is it this is nothing it's just a simple little box nothing really special but then you have all these outputs in the back alright and as you can see of the you know you have the power over here and then you have the HDMI like here okay and then you have the they're right over here so that's perfect you can apply whatever you want than this I think you can plug your phone or something this is something Apple device I don't really know anymore but yeah this is it so this is the Apple TV uh it's perfect small you can do whatever you want and what I'm amazed that this little box has everything that you need to it to to watch Netflix YouTube or whatever you want and also you can airplay from your phone iPad or whatever device so that's pretty cool and we're gonna get into that shortly now let's go plug the TV like these the small Apple TV to a TV and then see what's gonna happen we've got all our Apple TV stuff we need right over here so we have the ethernet cable we have the HDMI cable and the power cable so that's all we need to plug the Apple TV all right so these are all the three cables we need now if we take the Apple TV we just need to do is plug the HDMI all right plug power is on this side and the internet so now we just kind of organize the cables and there so here is the Apple TV plugged all the cables perfect now one more thing I want to mention really quickly is that if you don't have an internet cable coming to your living room or to your room or whatever you can of course use Wi-Fi because the Apple TV has Wi-Fi in it so you can connect Wi-Fi if you have Wi-Fi home now the great thing you also get with your Apple TV is this cool remote that comes with it of course but you can also buy it if you want to have 16 of them but you have this remote you have the menu button over here that's like I'll show you all these buttons this is kind of like the home button on an iPhone this one then this one's for Siri of course the volume buttons plus and minus and pause button this remote is pretty straightforward and then you have the push button here where you push whatever you want to do and select alright so now what we need to do is just press this button and it's going to turn on the TV and the Apple TV as well once it's plugged so so as you can see we are the app store now for some reason I don't know why but you control the TV by just swiping on this kind of swipe button like this swipe and to select for example if you wanna select Netflix you just push the button you open it so it's pretty straightforward here and then to go back you just have to push the Menu button like that and you're gonna go back right there you go and now this is the main screen so basically I this is new so I don't have Netflix yet but I have YouTube you have music podcast search settings computers App Store iTunes movies and all these things also photos so pretty much good things and all you control everything with this remote so it's pretty simple now yeah pretty simple now you can control with Siri by pushing that button here and you speak and that's it so that's your TV pretty straightforward nothing really special but it's it's great now let's try the airplay so many of you want once in a while just use your phone and like make it on the baby put it on a bigger screen and show people not your only your phone but maybe put it on the TV so the Apple TV is perfect for that because you can stream music or whatever you want to your Apple TV from your iPhone or iPad or whatever alright so you take your phone in my case an iPhone and you unlock your iPhone and basically you just what you do is kind of share iOS then you just go up put your finger like that you swipe so you're going to an airplay mirroring here so you click on that and you're gonna get if you have multiple devices all of them will pop up here but I have only the Apple TV so if you push the Apple TV you see it's gonna switch to Apple TV over here and now normally camera you should see that there is my screen from my phone so that's pretty perfect so now whatever I you you will see just swipe like this I get whatever I want and it's going to be there so even if you want to excuse them you think or something or whatever you can do that so that's pretty perfect right and then just disable it you just have to click on it again and then just turn off AirPlay Mirroring and now you're gonna see we are back so that's perfect right the airplay mirroring is really good because you can stream music as I said you can even watch some TV show or movie that you have in your phone so you can do many many things with that to your Apple TV now the last thing is I would want to say before I say that verdict of it is to switch it off you just take your remote the remote over here and what you do and you hold this button here for a long period of like not a little bit just a little longer than usual it's going to show you something like it's sleep now okay this will turn off any connected devices and then you just press ok and it's going to shut down the TV and the or TV with it all right so now the moment you've been waiting for is my thoughts about it I think it's really it's a really good thing to have in your house because you can just it's a smart TV instead of buying a smart TV you just add this small addition to your TV it's just perfect you can watch YouTube Netflix whatever you want and it works you can do airplay I just think for the money it is it's worth it and I mean everything I have is worth it I think but yeah so I think you should get it if you really want to watch TV like Netflix or YouTube in your bed on the TV and to transform your own TV into a smart TV but anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below
