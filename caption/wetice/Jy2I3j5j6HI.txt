oh hello and welcome back to another video how are you today it's a fine day to record videos I have this shirt again I love it but today I'm going to show you my the new vlogging setup that put together since I got the ATD before we go in the next video to test out the camera so here it is it doesn't even fit in the like the thing it doesn't even fit but lucky just look at it here so it's probably it's like bigger than me let me just and zoom yeah let me unzoom alright here it is this is it so it consists off so it consists of the Canon a TD body then it consists of this lens which is the 16 to 35 millimetres fix aperture 4 so it's like a really good light level lens even though it's not the best of course but for fakes between 16 and 35 it's amazing because I don't have to be like concerned about the changing aperture whereas some other lenses have an aperture that is for example 3.5 25.6 which is the lens you are on but this vlogging setup is really good and if you watched the previous video with the 60 volume setup it had the same microphone so this is a rode videomic not the pro nothing like that just a standard video mic and on top I have the new micro muff no micro much like microphone muffler which is really good for wind and you know that from the previous videos that you watch hopefully I'm kind of hoping that you watched the previous videos and then of this Joby Gorillapod the black one I don't know the differences between them the one told me anything yet but if you know the differences between these gorilla pods accept the price let me know because I'm like completely confused from top to bottom of which one to get because I got this one like three times more expensive than like the white one and it's the exact same thing so it's kind of crazy but I don't understand too much about guerrilla pods now as you can see this is the vlogging setup with a flip screen so imagine it's like this pretty much showing it to you so I will be vlogging like this alright so it looks like that and that's really cool with a flip screen The Cosby Anthony has won and the 60 is pretty much very similar to this camera so I mean if I should say these cameras are very similar to each other except of the 60 being full frame and a TD not being full frame being more cropped but it supports full frame lenses which this lens is full-frame which I use the same one for the 60 mark too so it's really really good I really like it on manual settings performs really well but you're gonna see that videos you're gonna see videos testing this camera after coming like after this one there re recorded every time there is your recording I'm recording this one after those so that's really cool but I really like it I'm really happy with the camera I mean that I'm making this video that I can say because I already vlog a vlog on this one so I know that the vlog is great the footage is great it works really really well on everything I needed to do and it's a little bit more lightweight even though this lens is so heavy that I don't even know the difference if it's a 60 or an 80 d so it's really cool I really like it works with everything does the map in the pictures what's good for thumbnails but that's not the most important but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this video be sure to LIKE down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if you have any more ideas that I should do photography I'm gonna say this problem you know the other videos but anyway take care bye a baby's days crash [Music]
