hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to share with you some interesting news that we got today from Apple in the WWDC on your phone you can go get it on the App Store there are many things if you go into sessions there are a few hints that Apple is planning something cool and they confirm a couple of features so I would like to talk about them this comes just after invites were sent to the press and Apple confirms the two features coming in iOS 13 one being dark mode the highly expected feature and the second one being interesting as well but before we get into the video please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously if you go into the WWDC app on your phone you go into sessions you're gonna see that and you search for this little kind of title saying this session is kind of a dark horse so this doesn't 100% confirm dark mode but everyone's saying that dark mode is coming either way so at this point no one is saying that dark mode will not be available so I think this Dark Horse phrase in the WWDC app confirms a part of it on top of that we have a tweet about dark mode saying that it will be similar to the one of the Mac color wise it is not going to be pure black as I wanted or many people were expecting but it's going to be dark gray and I just can't believe that it's confirmed it makes me so excited to see all the features coming in about a week and a half so we're just excited over here the second feature is quite important as well there will be new support for hearing health that might be coming in iOS 13 they kind of hinted with that as well talking in one of the articles I cannot find it but I saw that on internet but Apple outright said in that article that it will be coming hearing health was first talked about by Bloomberg if you remember sharing this image and now Apple confirms it that it is coming well indirectly but they still kind of confirmed it that pretty much confirms what Bloomberg was saying so everything in Bloomberg said or most of it will be probably in iOS 13 which is just so exciting but there will be much more than this these are just the two few features that are confirmed by Apple but we are getting close to June 3rd where Apple will talk about all their software versions including iOS 13 but until then we'll probably see many leaks about features that will be confirmed many phrases that want to tease you by Apple so we just have to wait for that and I'll keep you updated with all of that there are so many features that are coming and I would love to know which feature is your favorite in the comments down below also while you're down there please leave a like and subscribe as it helped me out tremendously okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you [Music]
