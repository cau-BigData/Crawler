hey guys and welcome back to another video today is a completely different video we are in the nature there's a stupid boat behind me making a lot of noise but it's gonna be gone soon today I want to talk about the topic that is very important for everyone who makes videos on regular basis and outside and in nature and where it's windy so the reason for this is wonders wind you know the videos where you hear the oldies okay you know all of that kind of wind sound it's annoying right so for this you need a sound muffler you can get these from now there are waves so you can get so you can get these everywhere on Amazon wherever so they can be small for the small for example for the g7x it's just small like this it's detachable it's very easy attachable here and it's just this kind of small thing that you get they are not the cheapest also to say they're really nothing some kind of piece of thing you can even create it at home and then you just stick it over the microphone so what the sound muffler does is basically it blocks out all of the wind so you're just gonna have this blowing like that and it's going to block the wind and not create that ugly noise in the video now it's going to create some not a lot it's it's not going to be completely quiet like peaceful like when there's no wind you will for sure he'll hear a little bit but not as much as if you not have the Sun muffler now I'm going to take off the Sun after that I have on this camera now I took off the sound muffler from that the camera big one here from the big rode microphone this is also from rode so this is a big sound muffler for those big microphones that are for all the DSLRs this basically you just put it on the microphone and that ensures that there is almost zero wind noise in the video the DSLR microphones are so sensitive because they are big and really good for recording sound different than for example the g7x microphone was very small hidden inside and it's not a big thing on top of the camera that's coming out and the wind gets catcalled easily into the microphone now I'm going to show you an example it's not very windy today maybe you can hear some wind because now it's without it so now I'm going to just show you an example it's not very windy today so it should be fine but now I'm just going to blow in it hear that that's something that would happen if there would be a lot of wind outside and it happens a lot when you're making videos outside there's the same thing with the g7x except the g7x doesn't capture it as well and the audio is not as good that's the complete reason why it's very important to have the sound mufflers on your cameras wherever you go so here is the sound muffler on a big DSLR as you can see this is the whole microphone on a DSLR so it's it covers the whole microphone and it's great for recording outside and now there's some wind so as you can see it's kind of moving but that's it alright so this is it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos in the future make sure that you get your sound mufflers and put them on your camera's because it's very important for your audio not to have like ear broken stuff anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you [Music]
