all right hello guys and welcome back to another video so today I'm going to be talking in depth about iOS 12 on your iPad and on your iPhone so both of them are running iOS 12 as you can see both of them have iOS 12 and I showed you how to get iOS 12 early in the previous video so now I'm going to start with the iPad because that's where many features came and also the iPhone but the iPad I found really interesting what changed and how it changed it first off let's start with the top as you can see you have the time up here not in the middle anymore it's more of like an iPhone 10 thing now give the date here as well and then the battery Wi-Fi and the rest here which moved sides so that's really a big change that I really like that happened and then it works same like on the iPhone X that you just lets open something okay let's just open the calendar let's open the camera and let's open notes so as you do you swipe up and you bring up all of your things and you just go through which one you want and that's similar to the iPhone 10 now but of course you can still double click and you're gonna get the same screen now another thing is the control center normally we're swiping from the bottom right now you're swiping from the bottom to get here so where's the control panel the control panel is on top similarly to the iPhone 10 so your control panel you access by just swiping from the top corner down and here you can access all the things you need on the iPhone 8 plus which is the recent one and not the 10 which is the recent one but it's not that so the control panel is still from the bottom and it's still double-clicking to access all of your stuff the next thing that we notice is how fast everything works so it's up to 70% faster to get to the camera and I even see that it actually is super super fast so watch this really quick now when you unlock your phone you're gonna get the menu a lot quicker and apps open really quickly like 50% faster or so so everything works really fine and really great and it even feels faster overall which is really really good what also was introduced our group notifications so as you can see each is not just 500 of them but it's four here and like one here if you want to see you just click you just click here all of them get opened or you can just do show less and get back to where you work so that's really really cool so here are your notifications if you want to manage them you just swipe to the side click manage and you can make them turn off so you're not gonna get notifications from that anymore or you can deliver them quietly if you can swipe again you can clear all of them at once so you have no problems with notifications anymore so the next really good feature that I love is the screen time you can access screen time just by going to widgets when you set it up or if you go to settings screen time and you access your screen time right over here so it shows you many many other things and if you click here it's gonna show you your longest session where you're spending the time it's gonna show you where you're spending the time it's gonna show you how many times you picked up your phone per hour so 14 times the last hour and 157 total pickups today and here it shows you not vacations per app so you can like see which app is taking most of your time now what you also can set up is down time which is when you will be away from your screen and absolute be just sending you all the crap so that's really good for a night for example and then you have app limits you can set limits for apps like Instagram if you have an obsession and it will remind you if your time is up which is really really cool and then you can of course block inappropriate content you can set it up with your family and for your kids so it's really really good then you do not disturb which is really really great you can set the bedtime mode that's a very new feature and it's gonna work a lot better now an app that came is the measure app which you can start measuring stuff just kind of interesting so let's say you click on a point here at a point and let's measure just a few inches here and it shows you what you measure which is really useful for when you want to measure something now another app that was reimagined is the voice memos which is right up here it's not really I mean I don't know it's not really really new or anything but it's just revamped and everything is just fine in it I guess so what also what reimagined is the stocks app which is really really amazing and it's just welcoming me so here are your stocks on and then you have the news that are with the stocks related which is really good now and you can access the news quickly while watching your stocks now a subtle change which is right here it's the books it was iBooks before now it's just Apple books or books on this page now which is just like very small feature now you also have grouped FaceTime or up to 32 people can FaceTime at once and then you have any oh geez more of them then you have me emojis more of them you can make your own an emoji which is really cool or me emoji and many many other things also Siri suggestions she can help you with more things she's more useful and all kinds of things like that but as video is getting along now this is one of my long because the videos actually when
