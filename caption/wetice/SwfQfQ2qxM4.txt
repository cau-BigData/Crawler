hello everyone welcome back to another video so today I want to talk about the iOS twelve point zero point one which is the first update after the iOS 12 for the entire public which is something interesting right now there are quite a few changes and little changes in there but it's overall a better experience for everyone with this update so as mentioned in the beta previously now it's public for everyone so there's no more problem with the church issue where basically you could wake up in the morning and your phone would not be fully charged and that's because of a charge issue when you plugged it in you have to tap the phone or unlock it so you start charging so that's fixed now you can go on with your day with a full charge and not have to worry about that there was also a issue with the iPhone XS where it would have some problems with the Wi-Fi connectivity it would connect to 2.4 gigahertz bands of Wi-Fi when reconnecting instead of like the 5 gigahertz band so it was just kind of a problem there but that's fixed as well so the iPhone should connect to the fastest Wi-Fi band possible one update for all the iPad users and that's the symbol button on your keyboard has been switched with the emoji button so it's the same as on the iPhone now which is super great deal change for me as well because when I was typing I always tapped the emoji button when I want this symbol buttons so just kind of a improvement to have a better experience with the iPad there was another issue which was with the Bluetooth connectivity with some of the devices but that is now fixed so you have no problems there and also a subtle change is that some apps the subtitles were not working properly so now that's fixed you can watch your videos and stuff in different apps with your subtitles and they work so overall there's no speed increase in your phone it's just really an update to like improve your life and it's just something to improve how we use your phone a daily basis and just small improvements like that so it's worth updating you should go immediately and update it's a really great update it fixes many issues across the board and you're gonna enjoy okay this is it for this video if you enjoyed reached leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time okay bye
