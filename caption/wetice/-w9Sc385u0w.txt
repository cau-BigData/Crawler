hey guys and welcome back to another video how are you today it's a great day right today I'm going to be doing something similar to the previous video and that was photos a TD 6d today I'm going to be comparing video so as you can see we are on manual fully manual now I'm looking at the 6d right now this is the video from the 6d and down here you're going to have written always which camera the video is coming from now we are on the speed of 1000 a pitcher of 5.6 and an ISO of 100 on both cameras now let me just say the beginning the 6d mark 2 is full-frame with a full frame lens and the ATD is not full frame and is has a lens that's not full frame as well both have wide-angle lenses now as you can see me side by side now in the video it's always marked one is cropped whereas the other is full-frame that's the difference between full-frame and cropped as you can see them side-by-side you can kind of tell the different colors on the 6d we are over let's say I would say that the speed is too high we're kind of over it's kind of too much light there whereas on the ATD we are a great light great speed everything's like said how I would usually have the camera alright so I am going to go up with the speed on the 6d because I feel like there's too much light so I went to 1600 and as you can see if you see them side by side they seem to be almost on the exact same kind of color and if I'm looking in the viewfinder they're almost the same so that's probably how equivalent they are so you can be on a higher speed on the 6d and on the ATD you have to have a lower speed because it means more like but that also can be due to the lens and the camera itself of course since we're comparing two different cameras with two different lenses not the same lens but that's maybe some discrepancy that we have now to speak about the lenses since we have some discrepancies I have a Canon 16 to 35 millimeter is for aperture lens so it is a very good lens with a very low aperture and a fixed aperture so that's also one thing to keep in mind whereas on the ATD I have a canon 10 to 18 4.5 to 5.6 and since I'm on 16 millimeters now on it we are close to the top of the aperture so it we are at 5.6 so basically that's like a difference that we have is the light level if I could put the same lenses maybe the outcome would be a little bit different but that's what we have so as you can see now on the ATD I changed the lens so I changed it to a full frame lens which is the canon EF 28 to 105 millimeters at an aperture of 3.5 to 4.5 now I am at 4.5 on the ATD and at 4.5 on the sixty the sixty did not change lenses now what just changed that we are on the focal length of 35 on both cameras the thing you can see that when you see them side by side is the ATD is way more zoomed in than the 60 that's as well due to the full frame of the 6d and the not full frame of the ATD so that's the big difference here now let me talk about the speed which is also a very big kind of problem here now on the ATD we have a lower speed than on the 60 the ATD has a speed of 800 because it needs way more light to have the optimal exposure now the 6d mark 2 has a speed that's higher than the a TDs it's at 1250 it needs less light to have the optimal exposure now this can also be due to the cameras or the lenses or both at the same time and they're not the same cameras with not the same lenses so there can be some discrepancies now keep in mind also that this video is not color corrected has an ISO of 100 on both cameras when I'm looking in the viewfinder I see that the 60 mark 2 looks a little bit better than the ATD and as may be due to also that it's more zoomed in but that's pretty much it so this is everything else say to this if you have any other questions or any other requests leave them down in the comment section down below or leave a like and subscribe will be greatly appreciated for more videos like this alright take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you [Music]
