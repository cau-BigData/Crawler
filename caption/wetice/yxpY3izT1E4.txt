hello everybody and welcome back to another video today I would like to take a look at the iPhone 6s and answer a common question is the iPhone 6 is still a good buy in 2019 but before we do please consider leaving a like and subscribing for more videos like these the iPhone 6s launched in 2016 and we are approaching its four-year anniversary well not quite but we are getting there it has some features similar to the current iPhones let's start talking about the design at this point the antenna lines are still there which doesn't look really nice in 2019 you have the second-generation touch ID pretty thick bezels around the screen it's pretty thin though and it has a headphone jack the design is overall a little dated in terms of built quality it is made of very solid aluminum it is less scary than having an all-glass phone back but still wear a case it has a pretty accurate touch ID sensor that is not as fast as in the newer iPhones the screen is a 4.7 inch LCD retina it is not as vibrant as OLED though however it has 3d touch but it isn't as fast as on the current iPhone the video playback is quite good at a 16 by 9 ratio pretty display and it can be OK in 2019 when it comes to software you will be getting updates for the next few years to come well maybe you can have iOS 12 which is very good and still you have an iOS on an older device the main experience on iOS is overall pretty much the same on all the phones when it comes to performance there's an a 9 CPU with 2 gigs of RAM internal GPU meaning that the CPU is still good it is not as fast as the newer ones but it is not as bad as I thought the battery life however is not as good as before it should get you through half a day for heavy users and for like users it will probably last just about the day but keep in mind that it depends on how much capacity your battery still as the phone quality is quite good for an older device the microphone or speaker is not the best but as long as both people hear each other then all is good we can say that it has a basic call quality let's look at the camera it has a 12 megapixel camera with very similar software for newer phones but you don't have the portrait mode which was introduced by the additional camera you also don't have the 4k 60 frames per second but you can go up to 4k 30 frames per second which should be more than enough the image processing is good for 2019 as well especially for the price it is at one thing that many people will like the portability and the reach ability you might be asking what is that the phone is not as big as the phones in 2019 and you can still reach the other end of the screen without making too much of an effort many phones don't have the headphone jack anymore but this one has it however having one speaker grille is very annoying it can get easily covered while holding the phone audio is not the best either but it's good now should you buy this phone if you can get it for less than $300 then it's pretty it's a pretty basic phone and it's it can be quite good however you can have really better Android phones for a lower price however if you want the cheaper iPhone to have iOS then this could be a good option well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe as it is greatly appreciated also please let me know if you have any other ideas in the comments down below okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
