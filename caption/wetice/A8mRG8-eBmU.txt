hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video today so today I decided since soon I'm going to be building my new computer I decided to review the case we just got so I went through the manual that looks through many things about it and I kind of studied it out how it works and basically what to do with it and what can you do with it so that's how I think this case is a good case but of course that I'm going to see later on and I'm going to probably may kind of like a part two to this later on whenever I have the computer running and I can see the performance of it that means that today we are going to be reviewing the be quiet case 800 full 8 X so that's what you're going to review and it came to be here shortly and we're going to kind of take it into pieces and look inside of it and I'm going to explain it as much as I can about it so it's going to be kind of like a review but a review but kind of like how to and how does it work in what it is kind of type of video ok so here we have the front of the case and you have these two kind of doors so this one on top here you open and you can put your CD player or whatever kind of things you want to put there so this is hidden by a door so you can just close the door usually and you can also easily like put it out by removing this kind of like two screws and you have it out then the legs are what you have here are if you push it on both sides this kind of falls down and you have a filter here and the sand behind it so the filter you just need to open this door for it and you kind of take this out you can clean this easily and then you have the fans back there what I'm going to show a little later this is one of the size here you have kind of like a viewing window to it inside and then you have kind of feet where it stands on so this is one of the sides of it and you can just basically see what's going on inside the computer here you have the back of the case so you're going to have the power supply here goes to the graphics card and all of that and here you have another fans I'm going to get to a later and then here you're just going to have the motherboard and then what you have on bottom you just kind of take this out and you have the filter for the power supply what you can again clean easily by just taking it out and then you just push it out just push it back in like that and here is the other side what is just kind of playing with the be quite logo on the top it's kind of playing again and basically what you have here is two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 and I have to connect your microphone connector and like the turning on button here so then there's an easy way of removing one of the panels it works on both sides is just these two screws over here so you unscrew this one for example and you unscrew the one that is on the bottom and normally you should just be able to close it and as you can see the door just comes out easily and it works also on the other side now what we need to do to make it naked basically is first start by removing this small door here that I explained already by removing these two screws over here next thing we need to do is remove the filter what we already saw now what we need to do is remove the first channel and by doing by pushing and kind of like removing it so now with some struggle will remove the front panel and it looks like this so far and now what we need to do is remove the top and the bottom for removing the top there are some clip it on bottom what you need to kind of push up to release the top so the top is kind of more complicated than then all the sides you see it has to kind of clip like that and then also on the other side and on Arthur's side so now with again some struggle for the top just have to unclip some clips are from the bottom of it and then it should just come off like this and you come to this Chuck's over here i'm going to explain shortly the bottom is very easy you just have and it's going to come off really like this and then you're going to have the top piece off and this is the whole case okay so you saw the case previously in its full kind of shape where it comes in the box and now it's all in the frame that's in metal so this is how it is basically without all of the kind of plastic design on it so it's just like this really simple and all in metals so perfect so here we have the fans that bring the air into the case so there are these two fans that bring the air and what they say that they should be super quiet and they should not make so much noise while bringing the air into the case then this fan inside takes the air out of the case and sends it out of the case so basically you can see that the fans there here in front behind these two shelves just cooperate with this fan over here and I think they should make quite a good environment for for the pc build then the next thing we have appeared that you saw previously but it was covered nicely by the plastic case so you have these two here with our two point oh and these with our three point 0 and then you have your sound input so these are the inputs that you have on the case where you have basically also the button but as you can see the button is not here anymore we just have the cables here from the button so then this area is normally covered by the plastic covering but now you may be confused why this hole is here there's always here for the fans and the cooling system for the CPU what can we place here or on the bottom but it's it's better on top obviously next here you're going to have the power supply coming in like this so it's going to be attached here and there are kind of these small holes for screws over here that basically hold the power supply in place as you saw the power supply is going to be sitting right here like this where's my hand the fans are going to be here and you saw that they there was this filter what's on the bottom attached normally with the plastic but since now the plastic is not there it cannot hold and this basically filters the fan for the power supply so here as you can see the mounting for the motherboard and it has four different sizes like ATX and micro-atx only and you can just fit them here and you just follow kind of the letters that are all over and you place the motherboard on them over here you can put all your disks your hard disk can go all in here so you can put quite a lot of them and then in the back we have these two places where we can put the SSP so you can put two of them if you want there is this small cable management that comes already with the case as you get it and that's all for only these inputs on top and that comes kind of inside but then the rest you can organize yourself whenever you want and then of course you get these cables from all of the fans you
