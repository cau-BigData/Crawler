hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video great fun day another bust our daily streak is coming to an end we're in the last five videos I believe if I counted correctly but yeah hopefully hopefully I counted correctly but it's kind of sad but well soon left when did yeah because I'm leaving for a month so today we're going to look at some ways cities control your behavior like secret ways control your behavior and you just even try to look in your own City maybe for these kind of signs they're kind of secretly trying to control your behavior but let's just take a look one fake visible cameras are cheap method to keep people from doing naughty things yes but you don't know if they're faker and they're real so this actually will work and it works probably on everyone because everyone when you see a camera you're not going to do anything but they may be fake but those this is because they they can be real and then they'll catch you and you'll have a bad time many benches now have armors to prevent people from lying down and sleeping this I agree before we have benches where there were no armrests you just you know you could lay down and now they send putting these are my pension they you know like simple homeless or people just want to lay down they cannot I think they do a save on the airport at the airport there it didn't say many airports I mean last time I want to lay down and like no armrest no Armas annoying oh this is probably like an incredibly new trend or something have benches how are you supposed to do anything anyway you can just lean on them and they're not even comfortable for sitting because you're still standing so just stupid you cannot do something like this and put these kind of benches there and well this guy fire found a way to play down but I don't think very comfortable spikes rocks or steep slopes underneath bridges are supposed to deter people from staying overnight now in my city I never really saw this kind of thing under the bridges but wellness maybe you can see this kind of pyramid shapes and you'll probably not sleep on them unless you bring like a whole big mattress or something but that will hurt if you don't sleep well this you have in every city small trashcan openings you know this kind of small where you barely fit the bottle inside you have to squeeze it in well there's probably some people were throwing out large items and now they figured out that they can deal with that so we're gonna make them smaller and people not they're also many things how about that my best in every city now I think another example of discouraging people from sleeping in the area next to the windows which is for this kind of design and people cannot sleep there under the roof so that's kind of mean actually at the same time but you know they should not be sleeping there in the first place so yeah I mean it's just how it is and this weird bench also another band only benches and they will deter anyone from staying too long like that's not hurt only sitting on the bench but I would love to come and lay on that no no way but you know in cities you all these people try to control your behavior by putting fake camera fake benches a half benches and like what this is like please don't watch just remove the benches there you go and put spikes all over the city and then you'll be fine how about that is that great I think that would work perfectly for no one sleeping and how would you walk but anyway guys this is good for this video if you enjoyed we should leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future I really hope you're enjoying these take care and I'll see you in tomorrow's video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
