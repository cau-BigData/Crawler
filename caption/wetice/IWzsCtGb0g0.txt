hello everyone welcome back to another video today we have a lot to cover regarding the latest I was 13 rumors and leaks there has been a lot about iOS 13 recently even though we are still quite far away from the actual release there are a number of different sources all confirming many interesting features and changes that you wouldn't even expect but what we know for certain is WWDC will happen on June 3rd and I was 13 beta 1 will be released at that time now if you're excited then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news the biggest chain who we'll be seeing in iowa's 13 will be the redesigned homescreen Apple will mainly focus on the homescreen of them iPad but that doesn't mean that the iPhone won't get some touch-ups as well apple carplay should be seeing a dramatic refresh with a new home screen as well there are a bunch of concepts for iOS 13 which look amazing I really love the concept by Leo Vallet that takes I was 13 from such an angle that is truly beautiful I just wish it would be like this as the final product Bloomberg also shared their rumors for I was 13 but didn't go into much detail and didn't provide any concrete looks or concepts but let me know what you think about a homescreen a design in the comments down below further not only the homescreen is changing the experience will be better due to the new dark mode that will be 100% coming in iOS 13 Bloomberg and Mac's wind back from XD a confirm this I was 13 will be the version that will catch up with Mac OS TV OS and watch OS which already have a dark mode still I keep thinking why did Apple not add this feature earlier well who knows however there are some sad news for the people which were hoping to get dark mode unfortunately it will maybe be released in I was thirteen point one or later based on this tweet from max wine back however Bloomberg says this will be coming in iOS thirteen beta one hmm I don't know who to trust at this moment we will have to wait until June moreover Apple doesn't always release all the features at once as they want to keep iOS fresh throughout the whole year so it is possible that Apple will postpone dark mode to Iowa's thirteen point one or so however I think they would be making a mistake as that would be their main selling point for the new iPhones in 2019 anyway lets me know in the comments down below if you think Apple will postpone dark mode or release it immediately also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more now besides the homescreen a design dark mode and huge interface changes the volume HUD will get revamped at least that's what max whine back is saying the volume HUD became a joke in iOS and is it still in the middle of your screen and takes up all of the space we should be seeing it somewhere else maybe on top or the bottom that should be super cool with a new release of iOS come new emojis as well now new emojis almost never come in the first beta of a new software so we should be seeing it in iOS 13.1 13 42 or 13.3 don't worry new emojis are on the way emoji PDA is almost always correct about which emotions will be coming and created some of them there will be new accessibility emojis new animal and many more I am actually really excited for the animals and of course the yawn emoji let's get into the iPads now the iPad has slowed down but now with the new iPad pro many people are more excited about the iPad I was 13 should bring many changes to the iPad including a huge home redesign dark mode tabs and apps and same two apps side by side with all this new stuff we are going to see a redesign files app which is currently not very good and it's pretty much useless now the most important part Apple confirmed at WWDC 2018 that iOS app so be available on the Mac in 2019 Bloomberg says that we will first see iPad apps come to the Mac and then in 2020 iPhone apps come to the Mac eventually there will be a single app store with apps that can be for iOS and Mac OS that is cool as well to end the video some of the current apps will also be getting better there will be a new toggle in the mail app which will allow you to mute threads you can take it as a do not disturb for mail the Photos app will be redesigned and will involve a I oughta mented reality it'll apparently use an algorithm that will help you see what you want to see and help you search more efficiently Mac swine back also says that the Safari app will be finally redesigned as well it'll be faster and more efficient but anyway I would love to read your thoughts on all of this in the comments down below also while you're down there then consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated all the recent Apple news and a bunch more now thank you very much for watching I really appreciate all the support on this videos and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
