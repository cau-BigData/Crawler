okay hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so this is the third time i'm recording this because it's a topic that it's very important today i want to take this video and talk about something that's been happening in youtube the past few days and that's basically where YouTube removes monetization from channels under 10,000 lifetimes views so I agree in I agree with it in some way but in a way I don't agree with it but I think that this solution will will help the platform in general it will remove a lot of channels and filter channels that are offensive for example and don't fit the criteria so I think it's going to filter the website quite massively and 10,000 live side views is something also as a motivation to start working for it and also at the goal you can set it as a goal and and reach 10,000 views and then you can alleviate monetization so it is a goal but until then you need to engage with your subscribers and and make as many videos as you can and then to be good of course but it if you know I think that the more videos you make but of course good videos they have to be you will get used quickly so 10,000 views a really good goal to set and if you are really motivated and have a passion for YouTube then you will get that in no time I like story of mine for example I started a year ago and and I go to 2,300 view so far end of today and and I mean 10,000 views I'll have probably maybe in six seven months so that's based on my calculations i will see if that happened but you know it's I think a good kind of milestone or threshold where basically you decide if you are eligible for for monetization if your if your channel is good standing a like Cochran strike while and also committing guidelines strike wise so it's just a good feature or features it's a new rule kind of you know so it's I think that a overall it will work hopefully so it really motivated me even more even though this morning when I read this article about YouTube you can go read it i'll leave it in the link down below so you can go check that out but i was reading that and i already like two or three times to understand if it affects my channel but it affects all of the channels that have under 10,000 lifetimes views but you will not lose any profit you have made already so don't get scared about that and I know that many of you also have youtube channel as I know the one to comment at least I go check out your channels I know that that you have also channels and some of you are small and some of you have a small channel as I do and it affects you also so this is something that affects us all youtubers that are under 10,000 ice time use what like 10,000 that's not a lot but for me even the 2300 that's a lot and that's incredible I never knew that I would get up to this point of course but i try i have a passion for youtube and and i try to make this video's as best as i can and and i think that every single video i made i learn something new and i continue developing some skills and becoming more professional or just more experienced with with with like for example video editing and so on music matching and just overall with with YouTube other that's what I think since the past year I I was you know changing every single my videos from better hopefully but this topic really surprised me i I was I was kind of expecting this but not so early you know that one months ago you two had some problems with advertisers and and I knew that some new change will be coming but not to this extent maybe I should that will filter out the there's some channels which which are useless you know what I mean useless they're not useless any channel is not useless useless but some of them they're not active or anything and don't get view the month they're kind of useless so what I know of you're going to the youtubers were you started as me one year ago I think they'll still stay in two partners if you go to like your channel I'll show you if you go over here for ya so if you go over here channel status and features you sit on partner verified still so that did not change but I think you're going to stay like that but you're going to be d monetize and and I see that already but if you go to video manager then you will see that over here this is your monetized button and you will see that still monetized but that's not true actually because because you are not I have no ads on my videos I it only says this but I have no ID on my videos so that that's not really really good for me but of course YouTube is my passion and what I care most is about you guys and and the people who watch my videos because they are the ones who got me place i am now so i post videos I'm not quitting or anything this made me even more motivated maybe some of you guys are less motivated because of this change because you're not going to be able to see some numbers or something but you know Billy if you believe in yourself that you're going to achieve such a goal then you should just go for it and end in your case to 10,000 10,000 views in no time if you stay motivated and make videos for fun that's what I do of course now maybe this video with all over the place but if I should you know recap everything I said is that i agree with YouTube decision of you know making like a spiritual of 10,000 views 0 is what if you reach then you are eligible for monetization it's perfect because then also the advertisers don't get a lot of money and they don't advertise to too many people on a channel my side for example so I agree with this and hopefully is going to make the site better in a way and going to remove offensive content and its content doesn't meet community guidelines so so hopefully this explains some of it to you guys maybe already knew about this but I just wanted to talk about it a little bit too maybe like some of you know who are you to present don't know about it yet and yeah so this is a topic that I'm you know you need to think about what your future of your channel will be because some of you may even some of you may not like this change in general but just stay motivated keep this as your passion and look at the numbers the numbers only come with with the passion so work hard and you will achieve your goal so this is racked up for this video I think I explain most of it but in my head I have so much that I don't know if I said everything I wanted to I was even thinking of writing it down but nah I just wanted to talk a little bit okay this'll do it if you enjoyed leave a like down below it would be greatly appreciated and subscribe for more videos like this and yeah so I hope that the people watch this video and I earned that 10,000 views I I wish you good luck and and continue and and be motivated because this makes you motivated probably hopefully it makes me motivated so is if this is your passion then go for it okay [Music] you [Music]
