what's up guys for the first time we have the design of the iPhone 12 pro air power is still not that we are talking about it and Apple continues working on the headphones coming as soon as WWDC 2020 all right let's get into these incredible leaks let's start with the revealed design of the iPhone 12 Pro we can really see how different it looks compared to other iPhones over the past couple of years over the past years the iPhones didn't change that much or okay just like minor changes but this year it will look so much different further the notch is finally going to be getting smaller which is something we have been waiting for since the iPhone 10 release on top of all this Apple is going to be making the bezel so much smaller and I believe it's going to be about one millimeter which is quite impressive on the back there are going to be four camera holes except there's gonna be only three cameras and one will be the lighter sensor the sensor was already revealed on the iPad pro last month which allows for better pictures and a are the antenna lines are a little thicker as well and that's for a very good reason 5g is coming to this iPhone in order to compete against the other Android 5g phones but this will either way be a great upgrade further from this image we can see that the SIM tray is going to the other side of the phone it has been on the same side for so long but now it's going on the side of the volume buttons now why would it move well there might be a smart connector for the Apple pencil after hearing lake's for so long now of course this will probably only be on the iPhone 12 Pro max because any screen size below the six point seven inches which is not make sense so with the iPad pros design a six point seven inch OLED screen the iPhone 12 pro max might be the phone which will introduce Apple pencil support so you know how the speaker holes on the bottom of the iPhone are not symmetrical well Apple is removing one of them this year while making the speaker's up to 15 percent louder the power button will also be going a little lower than the previous iPhones which is very likely because of how the components are going to be arranged this year on a sidenote Apple is also working on new color options for the whole iPhone 12 lineup the midnight green which is on the pro series is probably going to be replaced by a dark blue or navy blue color for the iPhone 12 there might be colors like orange light blue and purple now what do you think about all these changes on the outside let me know in the comments down below another product that I am really excited about are the Apple branded headphones John Prosser is saying that these could be coming as soon as during WWDC in June but generally WWDC is not a hardware conference but rather focused on software so we'll have to see Bloomberg is saying that Apple has a multiple of these headphones and testings there are two types one for sports and like workouts and the other made out of leather for real studio work further 95 Mac already discovered this in I was 14 so this is very likely going to be released in a very short timeframe they will have noise cancelling and other features that are unclear just yet but keep in mind these are not going to be Beats headphones but pure Apple branded ones now on the topic of air power which almost everyone deemed dead last year it was originally announced in 2017 and got canceled last year we have a source saying that Apple is working on it again which is pretty impressive John Prosser got an image from an Apple engineer and it resembles very closely air power the original air power was supposed to charge your phone your watch and your airport all at the same time no matter where you would place them however Apple ran into an issue with heat but now they are testing by putting an A 11 chip to manage the heat more effect this could be able to manage all the heat depending on the device that you are charging which would maybe you remove all these problems John Prosser is also saying that this product if it's successful might be announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 well this is all the stuff I have for you today if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video if you're interested in more frequent updates or you want to chat with me then follow me on Twitter the link is in the description below also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] [Music]
