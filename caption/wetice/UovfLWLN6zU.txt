[Music] [Music] with the beautiful Sun Rise this morning we woke up really early I hope you enjoyed that girl about to leave it's 7 o'clock in the morning so here we go I'm really tired [Music] and we're sailing now so full sail we have I don't know about 10 15 knots of wind so we're really moving now and I don't even know what kind of speed but we're going quite fast now [Music] normally the hardest part is over now we're just going to be pretty much crossing at about five to six knots hopefully and we'll arrive there around five or six so like they know that's where we're going today the speed is out again so we're going around six knots of speed which is really great and we should be at the small island that's like midway around lunchtime and it is 10:00 a.m. right now so good so far [Music] we are about halfway we see the island that is halfway right next to us over there so we are well but the wind stopped a little bit and it's slower than before so we're going I guess still at a good pace [Music] [Music] so after lunch time that we ate so we are going with the engine now at about six not speed because there is a very little wind even like the ocean is really calm now but hopefully we're gonna get some more wind soon [Music] [Music] [Applause] as you can hear we are motoring through all the way to legally know where we're going to be tonight and there's really no way so there's nothing we can do [Music] next episode [Music]
