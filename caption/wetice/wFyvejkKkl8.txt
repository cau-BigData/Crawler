hello everyone welcome back to another video today we have so much to talk about and I'm so excited can you even see that we have some exciting Iowa's 13 rumors the volume HUD will be changed finally Bloomberg shares a report about Apple's extended plan for the next few years and the Mac Pro could be unveiled or previewed during WWDC in 2019 if you're excited then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news as you know the standard volume HUD has been here for many years and it became kind of a joke in iOS the volume HUD is also in the center of the screen which can be frustrating at times actually most of the time there is this one tweet from XDA which is an Android developer site it was tweeted by Mac swine back saying so just got some amazing news in iOS 13 the volume HUD is gone Apple is finally fixing their software it's also supposed to be groundbreaking but whatever he doesn't seem really excited about it though but I am anything that will not pop up in the middle of the screen will be cool it would be cool to see the volume change on top or on the side maybe I would be so happy after so many years of waiting for this I really feel like Apple just decided to make 2019 an exciting year they will implement dark mode after too many years change the homescreen primarily on the iPads with some touches on iPhone redesign the photo app and finally remove the absurd of volume HUD yes there is another report from Bloomberg about cross-device apps I feel like this needs an explanation so here it is when a developer is making he chooses a platform for it in this case for the iPads iPhones and Macs so for iOS and Mac OS but iOS has different code than Mac OS meaning that the developer cannot post his app on both of the platforms so Bloomberg says that Apple will allow for cross-platform apps this means that the developers can take their apps from iPhone and iPad and make them available on Mac with minimal changes to the code Apple confirmed cross-platform apps in the past and making it available in 2019 Bloomberg says that iPad apps will be available on Mac as early as WWDC 2019 however iPhone apps will be able to do this only in 2020 the report further states that by 2021 Apple will release a single binary so before you would have to put separate apps on Mac and iPad but now you would put them into a global App Store where iPad iPhone and Mac would be able to download the apps using the single binary this in practice is pretty cool but it comes to the user satisfaction not so good you can really notice in the news and voice memos app that it isn't really made for Mac but rather made to use a finger further it could even hurt the appeal of Mac why would you get a Mac if you could just have an iPad with the same apps good question that's why this wouldn't really work in the long run I would love to know what you think about this and whether or not it is a good idea let me know in the comments below at the end of the support things get interesting we get some information about the upcoming Mac Pro which has been around for the past six years without any upgrades Bloomberg says that we could be learning more or even see it as early as WWDC 2019 the new Mac Pro should be customisable to some extent but let's be real Apple and customization they don't really go well together but we might be surprised about Apple's new approach it is also not uncommon for Apple to release a product during their mainly software based show in June in 2017 they released some hardware and in 2013 they released the Mac Pro which we see today so after all we might be seeing the Mac Pro during the Worldwide Developers Conference in June but this is all for this video so let me know your thoughts in the comments down below also like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news but anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music]
