hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at Iowa's 13.2 developer beta 3 Apple released it to the registered developers and it should be soon coming to all of the public beta testers so the update came at about 220 megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max right over here so the first thing we have to go check is in Settings General about we can tap here and we see that we're running 17 B five zero seven seven a the a at the end means that we're really coming close to the end of the thirteen point two beta series but we might see a few more another change right here is in the modem firmware if we look at it we see that we went from 1.0 2.0 a to 1.0 2.0 one three not zero one three just one three that should help with connectivity issues if you've been having any and should just help with all the cellular things tripod users right over here there was some trouble updating to thirteen point two beta two but now you should be able to update to beta three without having to go through iTunes or YouTube without restoring your iPad so basically what thirteen point two beta 2 did to all the iPads is basically break them which isn't very good the biggest change previously was that you could delete apps so you could like delete whatever but it would say like delete Instagram or delete carrot weather but now it just says delete app so it's really simplified and it's just delete app so that's kind of just becoming standardized across the whole system Apple music had some problems with sync so sometimes usually you'd lose your entire library you'd have to completely erase everything so that everything would resync again now you should not have these problems anymore it should be working a ton better and you shouldn't have to do that it should be syncing correctly some people say that Cellular got up to two times faster on thirteen point two beta two I haven't tested that I haven't seen if it actually is but it depends many people reported this running AT&T so it just it might just be AT&T doing it but I don't really know performance performance is great it seems to be smooth there's no lag or stutter everything works really well I have no issues whatsoever battery life full battery life seems to be quite good if we head over into battery and just check the last 24 hours I didn't have this update for so long yet so I cannot really say if the battery life is great or amazing or if it's really bad I don't really know however as you can see I've been using my phone quite a lot in the past 24 hours and the battery life is holding quite quite well so of course this is a new phone so the battery is not degraded this is a Mac Series phone meaning it has one of the best battery life out of the all the iPhones but overall you can see that I'm running really good I was even running really good on 13.2 beta 2 as you can see about 25% to 35% a day so I mean the battery life on my phone is pretty incredible as you can see the updates are becoming less and less filled with features there's nothing really much to talk about anymore except some of the little tweaks and some of the text changes the font changes and these kind of things nothing really different as you remember 13.2 brought as many different emojis accessibility emojis the new people interracial relationships and emojis and all of these kind of new emojis so that's really great hopefully we'll see more of these later but this is it this is it for this video so if you enjoyed then please do leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this and if you missed out on my previous video talking about 13.2 beta 2 then please click the card shown in the corner up there ok take care and I will see you in my next video soon okay bye [Music] [Music]
