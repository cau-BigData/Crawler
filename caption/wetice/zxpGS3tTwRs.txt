[Music] hello everyone welcome back to another video so today is my thoughts on the Apple watch after about a week so it's been a little bit more than a week but I'm doing this because I'm excited and I'll have the watch also which is kind of amazing I'll have to stand up oh crap anyway let me talk about my experience with the watch overall in this video so starting with the battery life which is very important on the watch it lasts me 24 hours about 24 hours I call a lot on it I exercise with it I even sleep with it so it pretty much takes me through a full day of 24 hours well minus one hour of charging so like 23 hours of battery life that's impressive so design design is really great actually I went with the 40 millimeter one and it's big enough in my opinion 44 would be too big on your wrist I believe but it's just my opinion then I went to the silicone like bad thing and it's really nice it's really comfortable to wear all day even sleep with it so no complaints there about the watch itself now all the features are really cool but there's no ECG yet which I'm kind of surprised about like I saw some videos about the ECG already but I don't know if it's already available so I have to look into that or maybe there's already an update and I just did not look at it yet but overall works really well Calendar I even modified my face like the Apple watch face from the phone it's really good the application works really well and since this is my first watch I'm still learning about all of the features that there can be you can download many apps into your Apple watch and it just does a marvelous job and also I figured out that by like swiping you have different options and different watch faces which is something that I never knew so it's really cool I exercise with it it tracks workouts really well the battery life is really good in workouts as well so honestly no complaints about this watch at all this has just been an amazing week with the watch and many more to come until next year so we have to wait all the way for next year for another one yep anyway the digital crown has been improved as well which is kind of impressive but I don't know how the crown was on the series 3 so I can't really compare that but it feels nice it feels like a nice scrolling and it just works really well maybe what could be improved is honestly I cannot even come up with something yeah I couldn't come up with something oh yeah something that could be improved is the tracking of exercise because sometimes I go walk for like 60 minutes and it just doesn't count all of them it counts like 30 minutes of them which is kind of annoying so you have to like turn on the like in the exercise you have to turn on your walk what they presented is that the workouts are detected so that's kind of a bummer but that's overall the only fact that is really annoying and even with the activity app in your phone and the app itself you have a very good synchronization it sings really fast like and do something on my phone add something the calendar within 10 seconds it jumps on my watch there's also a really good connectivity with the air pods with the phone and it just works really well honestly it connects to everything I needed to connect but anyway if you enjoyed this quick video then let me know in the comment section down below or by leaving the like and subscribing it would be greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time with another video yeah okay bye
