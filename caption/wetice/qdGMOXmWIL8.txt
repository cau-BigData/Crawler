hello everyone and welcome back to another video we have a lot to look at regarding the iPhone 12 pro the iPad and the Mac the iPhone 12 might come in a new navy blue color with a new design and upgrades to face ID on top of all this good stuff the iPhone se 2 or the iPhone 9 is going to hit the market in less than two months we already know that 2020 will have the biggest iPhone upgrade since the iPhone 10 in 2017 new sources are saying that the iPhones aren't going to start looking very similar to the iPad pro series but there are still many questions to be answered what will happen to the launch will it get smaller will it disappear or will it just stay the same further by how much are the cameras going to get better a new report from Mac a Takara is saying that the new iPhone 12 pro max is going to be 10% thinner compared to its predecessor of course it is better to have a thinner phone since it becomes lighter and more portable however what will happen to the battery size nowadays people want big batteries so decreasing the thickness by 10% might not make everyone very happy meketa car is also the first source to share that the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro Series are going to be getting bigger we also have been hearing about a new 6.7 inch iPhone 12 which could be without a notch with a thinner design and bigger cameras I would have to guess that it would be the iPhone 12 pro max it would also get rid of face ID and bring back touch ID which would be a big leap backwards last year with the release of the iPhone 11 Pro Series we got an unexpected green color this year we might get an additional navy blue color but don't worry if you don't want to spend so much money on a new iPhone then Apple has two more iPhones in the works in the 12 series we are going to get the - 12 at 5.4 inches and 6.1 inches according to MacRumors face ID on the iPhone 12 models will be getting better but we have no specifics on how it will improve it would be great to finally see face ID work on multiple orientations on the iPhones especially since they already managed to do it on the iPad pro series it should also get faster as it could see some improvements that would make unlocking much more seamless the same report also drops a bomb about a completely portlet iPhone in 2021 this means you would only be able to wirelessly charge it I think it'll be kind of like when they removed the headphone jack but I still think that the world is not ready for only wireless charging just yet finally for those that are excited about the iPhone se - or maybe it will be called the iPhone 9 we have a new report from Bloomberg that gives us a specific date when we could be seeing the iPhone se - okay not a specific date but a specific month this iPhone will not be anything special but it will be a very budget iPhone around 400 to 500 dollars on leox shared many leaked images of what the iPhone se 2 might look like and for those that don't want to spend a ton of money it would be very worth it from Bloomberg we know that it will be coming as soon as March of this year because production is set to begin in February there will most likely be an event in March that will be specifically to talk and make you hear about the new iPhone se 2 or the iPhone 9 let's look at the iPad didja x is saying that a new smart keyboard for the iPad is coming very soon now what will be new on a keyboard well the keyboard will be backlit could this mean that we will see an update to the magic keyboard I have one and use it all the time since I love it so much but I miss the backlighting of course there is also some brief news on the MacBook there should be an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro coming in the first half of this year it will have some upgraded specs of course and a much better keyboard than in the previous models so wait a few more months and have a better 13-inch rather than buying it now wow this was a video if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I will see you in my next video [Music] you [Music]
