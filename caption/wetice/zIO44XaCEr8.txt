hello guys welcome back to another video today Apple iOS 12.1 point to beta 1 was released so this is a new release of iOS as a developers beta so it's not out for the public yet but you should see a public beta very soon in a couple of days maximum a week now the update overall what I see has quite a big size in storage space but there's not much to it which I was surprised because usually updates have something to see some new features some stuff like that but this one is just really not much and it's actually even kind of terrible it's the functionality is just not good at all now the app switcher so if you're like switching app so you open like let's say Translate and you swipe up to close it and close and swipe sometimes it gets bugged which means that it can cause some glitches that the apps gonna reopen then crashing it's just kind of like a bad thing when closing apps it's not smooth at all it just does a terrible job at it and I don't know what happened here but the app switcher is a total nightmare and I would just recommend that you don't use this on your personal device because it's a real big pain in the ass now I know this will change one change here actually you can notice is that the new ECG feature on the Apple watch can now be downloaded the firmware update for the Apple watch can be downloaded even if you're on the beta release so before you had to be on a stable release on your phone to update your watch whereas now you can be on a beta version and still download ECG so that was some thing that some people were saying that it was kind of annoying that I could not get the ECG without reverting to a stable release now there are some rumors from EA website 9 to 5 Mac which says that this release the iOS 12 point 1 point to beta 1 is ready for air power that's not sure it's just speculation but we don't know what's gonna happen but it would be great to see some air power finally and also the smart battery case is made to work with this version of iOS but that's just speculation no one knows if it's true or if something like that it's gonna happen it would be really nice to finally see a smart battery case for the iPhone X series because the last battery case there was was for the iPhone 7 or 8 not even the plus it was just for those and it was kind of annoying because if you wanted extra power all you could not it's either those Mophie cases but they don't look as good as the Apple cases but we'll see about that that's just speculation hopefully it's gonna be released by the end of the year that would be really nice and air power could come finally making life easier and new ear plugs but that's all speculation but it should be in this version of iOS so I mean should you update no don't update the app switcher is vile completely that's the most important thing on your iPhone is to switch between apps close apps open apps and that the whole thing is bugged and it's not functioning very well now it's not good at all for a personal device so if you just want to go play around with it which I would not recommend because there's nothing really to see even after I've been playing around with it there I cannot find anything different so just stick with the iOS two point one point one which is stable release or go to one of those public betas that are functioning well but for now stay away from this release I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in the next one with another release which I hope is gonna come very soon because this one is a nightmare and be nice see some news on the air power and the smart battery okay take care I'll see you next time bye [Music]
