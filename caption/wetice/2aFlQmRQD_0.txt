what's up guys apple released ios 13.5 beta 3 to the register developers yes you heard that right apple renamed ios 13.4.5 to 13.5 and for a very good reason also as a fun fact this is the first time ever we have a 0.5 update we are going to take a look at what's new all the bugs that are present the performance and the battery life so this update came at about 261.1 megabytes on my iphone 11 pro max this will of course vary depending on your device and from which software version you are coming from now why did apple rename this version of ios this is the first ios version that brings apple's covet exposure alerts for contacting people who have been exposed by someone close now if we head over into settings and general and the about section we can see that we're running 4 17f5054 and the h at the end means that we'll be seeing at least another beta in the coming weeks a little lower we consider the modem firmware remains unchanged at 1.06.00 now the kovit 19 exposure alert feature so this was developed by apple and google which shows that this will actually be a real feature now the explanation is when two people are in close range with proximity detected by bluetooth their phones will exchange anonymous identifiers if an individual gets diagnosed with covet 19 they can have their device transmit a list of everybody they have been in contact to the cloud the second person's phone will periodically download a list of everybody that has tested positive in their area and if a match occurs they will be notified and prompted to contact health authorities so this is the official description from apple and google apple is not releasing this api to all developers but mostly health authorities for the time being and will be adding more and more people during the testing period in the coming months now when will this be available to the public apple said that it will be in two parts in may apps will be able to use the api to track the exposure on ios and android devices and in the coming months apple be prompting people to join in without a specific application this will probably be in ios 14 beta so release to the public beta sometime in july now in ios 13.5 you already have a toggle in settings privacy health as you can see it is right over here on top and if you click on it there's little description under here as well and it's by default toggled on so if you are in this beta version you should definitely toggle it on it will be great to have that and keep in mind that apple is always keeping your privacy so you shouldn't be too concerned about that aspect now in ios 13.5 beta 3 there are not many features besides a change with face id if you wear a mask you know that face id doesn't work and it makes it a pain in the butt to get into your phone now face id will detect that you are wearing a mask and will go directly into the password section which will make it easier and faster to unlock your phone there isn't anything else that is new because this was mostly a covet 19 update however there are many bugs that were present in the previous betas and many of them were already fixed here but some of them still remain now a new text character bug is present that will crash your iphone which is present in all public beta versions now if you know it would be some specific characters it would be present on twitter or in any app and they would generally crash the app this is fixed in ios 13.5 beta 3 which is also available now in the public beta the vpn bypass bug is still present ever since i was 13.4 so we are still waiting for this one to be fixed however the mail app has been experiencing some big vulnerabilities hackers would be able to hack your device without you even having to click on something which is really not reassuring this was of course in your mail app but it was on apple's software side but now it should be fully fixed as of april 2020. so what about performance and battery life so performance feels about the same as on the previous betas and there will be probably no major difference regarding battery life battery life also seems to be good for the time being but of course it is too early to say however since this is a covet 19 related update there will probably be no massive improvements or worse changes to this on top of that we are on ios 13.5 and only a month away from ios 14 so apple will not make any major changes now so should you update to this beta you should definitely update there are many covet 19 related features which are important including the face id which makes it easier to get into your phone from your user perspective and also the covet 19 tracking feature which will allow you to be notified when you're exposed to the virus is also a great feature well if you
