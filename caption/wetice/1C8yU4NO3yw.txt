what a sad day today you probably know what's going on from the title but air power is dead we have been hearing about it for I don't know like two years now almost two years and we they showcased that in like two years ago and then they had to move it up because there it was overheating it had problems and it has been on and off there have been rumors and now we know what actually is going on it's that if you are probably not excited but if you want to learn more and want to have videos like this which I hope will not be something ever gonna be seeing very often then leave a like and subscribe stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more now today we have a report from TechCrunch that has received an official email from an Apple representative saying that air power is canceled it's dead what's funny about this as well is that packaging of the air pods to had the air power on the back in some countries which means that Apple was getting ready to release it and just have it well know now it's gone no more and just to add on to all of this Apple had a leaked image on their website yes we talked about us in one of my previous videos where Apple had that image embedded in their website and that's in some countries so this really says they were ready so basically for those people who don't know what air power is it is a charging mad that could charge your iphone your Apple watch and your air pods at the same time and you could place them wherever on the pad in no matter which direction orientation whatever that was supposed to revolutionize wireless charging and would have been super cool but now we have just some crappy copies of air power where devices have to be placed on a specific spot that's not something that Apple wanted to do Apple wanted you to be able to place it wherever on the path and who charged all of them at once and out of nowhere now it's dead there have been also reports saying that it should be coming in March many of them there were reports saying that it should come last week this week and now it's dead it's gone and Apple won't be probably making a new wireless charger any time soon so yeah this is really rare for Apple to drop products that they have announced and marketed and just made people excited for so I don't want to like sound really bad about this I it's a stupid charger at the end of the day but I was excited that you could charge all three of your devices at once on one pad and not have to have three chargers that's what I'm sad about but we're gonna get over it that's not the thing but for the people who don't know as well there were problems with air power that was getting too hot it either got too hot the pad or it heated up the devices which is bad for the battery and it could burn someone it could catch fire which is not good for Apple's so it's very frustrating very upsetting and we can only get the cheap ones now and like copies of air power or just regular wireless chargers now I don't know if this is April Fool's for Apple but I don't think because it's an official email from Apple but this report is really weird as well it never happened with Apple at least to my knowledge so yeah well I don't know what else to say I would love to know what you think about this whether or not it's an April Fool's joke which is like tomorrow or like after tomorrow is April Fool's Day but yeah I don't know well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more anyway take care don't cry and I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Applause] [Music]
