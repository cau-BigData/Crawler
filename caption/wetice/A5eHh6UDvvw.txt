hello guys and welcome back to another video today iOS 12.2 the official release is out Apple has been working on this update since I think January we've been talking about the beta and it's finally out here for everyone now in this video we want to take a look at the new features the new changes as well as the performance and how it just works so let's start with the new changes and features there is a new Apple TV icon which is upgraded again and it has been upgraded a couple of times in the previous beta so it's nice to see a small little change but it's there the Apple TV mirroring has been upgraded as well there are new tiles for the volume for the remote easy access and controls which is always nice to have staying at this subject the screen mirroring I can has changed as well meaning that it's always blue now instead of flashing or strobing whenever it was air playing as you know with the new subscriptions apple news change a tiny little bit as well it's more smooth that's a lot better I really enjoy overall how it feels and it is ready for a subscription of course we cannot forget about the new and emojis the shark the giraffe the owl and the warthog it's really nice to see some new animals that you can send to your friends and have fun with also small bits of Siri when you summon Siri to play some kind of music the toggle play thing will be in the Siri interface which is always great to see as well as it is a quite a good improvement now if you go to settings about you will see that there is a new section about limited warranty and a bunch of stuff like that some new like information that you can go look at and just know a bunch more about your phone in safari when you search something in the recommended section you'll see a blue arrow which shows that it's actually something that's recommended you can click on that it will go there then if we go to the safari settings now as you can see do-not-track is gone from there you cannot turn it on or off but it is on in the background then you cannot turn it off this is something that should have been there since the beginning actually as well with that we have the motion and orientation setting which I don't know what is for but it may be used in the future the performance of Safari improved greatly it's smooth it's fast and they've been working on it for a couple of updates now to make it a lot better and also not secure websites will be way more visible on top it's gonna say not secure and everything's gonna be fine so you're alerted way more clearly than ever before a big feature for all of you who don't have an Apple TV now you can have third-party TVs with airplay so that's something that you should take the opportunity of if we go into the wallet the whole interface has been upgraded it's a lot better and this is because of the Apple credit card that's coming so that's something nice to see as well also air power support has been added which is nice to see as it's probably gonna be coming soon we have been really excited for and now a few more screen time if you go to screen time and downtime you will see that you can adjust your downtime specifically for each day whereas before it was only from 8:00 to 10:00 but you could not select which days to be on so for example Saturday and Sunday you can have a different time and Monday to Friday you can have a different time as well the Maps app now if you zoom in to a city you're gonna see the air quality which is nice to see but this can always be disabled in the settings now should you update yes there's a bunch new features there's a great performance I don't know about the battery life yet but it's probably gonna be as good as in beta 6 and you just get a bunch more features in this and the small changes now I wish 12.2 is required for you to use your air pods too as well as air power and any other products it will be compatible with the phone in the future so for those which will buy those things when you have to update however for the people who want to jailbreak probably wait a little while and then see so it's a significant update you should go and update I really like it I have been using it for the past couple of months so I do not have any problems except of the battery life but everything's ok well this is the end of the video I'd love to know how I wish to open to has been free you in the comments down below also while you down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all of the latest Apple news and a bunch more anyway take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
