hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video vlog now as you saw you read the title probably right so you probably know what you're going to be doing today but I just want to say I've reorganized my room again if you want me to show you that just leave a like and maybe comment down below that you want to see and well i'm using a different background this time this is the wall behind me what you don't see the wall completely but this was the wall where i was recording my first vlog so that's kind of a wall that i really like i'm going to be reviewing the g7x mark tube so it's going to be kind of like one week with this camera because basically I've been with it for uh I've been using it if you just count the days I've been recording with it for a week now some of you know that I've been logging in Venice since three days fourth for ya for so then plus some days that I recorded in Vienna and so on this bad boy this camera here really nice camera really like slim camera very easy to carry around extremely easy it has a flip screen that basically I can see myself except that's not a very good thing because I have a tendency to be just looking if I vlog I have a tendency to be looking at the screen non-stop not at the lens that way maybe sometimes you see that my eyes are not focused at the lens not very good except the flip screen is in is an amazing feature now what they've noticed since you know I'm recording my vlogs on the EOS 100d mostly now it's not the best camera of all but it does a great job I think except it's not a very good low-light especially with my wide angle lens that is yeah but not very very good at low light performance but this bad boy what they noticed i can record very nice shot in like colorful areas dark areas at its crisp picture because with this one i just want to show you what would happen if I would shut down like my my light that lights me out if I shut it down this will happen so basically I mean it does still it's kind of ok the the video except it's kind of fuzzy and not that nice not crisp how I like to have it let's put the light on ok so back with the light looks better this basically I've been still learning how to use it a little bit but I mostly figure it out it has this kind of small wheel here so that wheel basically serves as a great thing when you wanna like change the light levels on your camera when I want to shot some dark images a dark videos that kind of make darkness and make the skies look like darker blue and just so on that I can make the show's darker in general or make put more life whenever I'm in some kind of streets where there's no light or something so it's perfect i can adjust it and that's why i really like it in low light because even if is in low light i just adjust it and perfectly and it i can go and basically just perfect for the light and of course it's a 1.8 2 2.8 aperture so basically it's good because the 1 i'm recording with this 4.5 to 5.6 not that very good right of course this camera let's turn it on has quite many features it switches automatically through the modes and basically selects the best one for you that you can have it like cloudy weather sunny weather and grainy where there are different kinds of weathers that means it adjusts the white balance and these kind of things all these kind of settings that you can do in the settings you can just adjust them so now you're going to see yourself basically now but that's basically how it is it's gonna weird honestly and it has this screen also as you can see I can go with the screen pretty much like this so whenever you want to shoot like just something like this for example I could put your camera like you point your camera up and and you shoot that you can see the view or whenever you go like down or something that you see that you don't have to you know so there's many purposes where you can move the screen around a little bit just kind of like an arm so basically you can do whatever you want with it so that's really what I like it has also a very good grip so you can even vlog if you want really you kind of look like this I accept it so a I prefer to vlog with like I'm a gorilla pod or something like that so yeah now the microphone and speakers are on the same spot that's what I'm going to say uh what it's I mean it's okay except I don't know you put your finger above it and you just block the microphone that happened uh so but you'll just need to be careful you just need to know where it is now the funny thing that I found about the g7x is that basically floor opening the flesh many cameras open the flash automatically when you're taking pictures except this one you have to like flip the lever and it pops up this little thing here this little thing pops up and you can basically then put it back in so it's kind of a small little thing that I find fun and you can take your picture then that's perfect in fact so you can take pictures you can take like portrait pictures you can take landscape pictures they're really nice I mean you can do many things with this compact camera this canon g7x mark 2 I would really recommend it to vloggers if you want to start blogging or something if you want to do vlogs at home I would recommend maybe like an SLR camera but if you want to vlog outside and go somewhere this goes in your pocket easily and you just carry it around wherever you go so that's perfect so one week of using this my final answer is that it's a perfect camera for vlogging can do whatever with it zoom the focusing the autofocus just perfect and I would really recommend it so that's verdict of what I think about the camera so if you enjoyed the video be sure to leave a like down below it'll be greatly appreciated please subscribe it's gonna be greatly appreciated for sure and yeah so if you want me to do more of this kind of review videos or something let me know in the comment section down below and anyhow take care and I'll see you the next video
