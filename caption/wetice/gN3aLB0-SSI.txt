what's up guys today we've got some interesting news regarding upgrades to the airpods with some new health features a first look at the iphone 12 logic board and a possible gaming mac as well as so much more starting with the iphone 12 we just got our first look at its logic board now for some this could reveal a lot about the iphone but the only thing i understand is that it is a little longer compared to the previous generation however will it have usbc or lightning this has been the topic of discussion for so many generations of iphones but it will remain lightning based on a few sources further they are saying that the iphone will never have usbc but don't think it will keep the lightning port next year's iphone so the one of 2021 will have no ports at all but there will be a smart connector so essentially you will never ever have usbc on the iphone all right what about the airpods john proster has been saying that new airpods are supposed to be coming this month but they aren't out yet and we have still three days left however a report from digitimes talks about the future features on the airpods they are saying these could include some health features by using the ambient light sensor no they are not going to adjust the light in the earpods because this technology can also be used to measure your heart rate but these health features are definitely not going to come with the pair that is supposed to be just around the corner so what about that gaming mac this leak comes from at chocobit over on twitter saying that apple is working on a new mac that is good at gaming to make things clear they are working to make gaming better on the macs they aren't going to release a specific gaming mac apple is currently working on a new imac and a new macbook whether it be a macbook pro or a macbook air it is said that the gpu will be much more powerful than before which should lead to that gaming performance increase also we don't know if apple will be including the arm chips they are making to replace their intel chips he further says that this could be apple just playing around and then just never talk about these products or never ever release them another thing to keep in mind is that apple doesn't want to start competing with pure gaming computers they are mainly going to do this to make their apple arcade ecosystem much better these could be shipping as early as the end of 2020 or towards the beginning of 2021 of course don't expect a completely new product to be launched this better gaming computer will probably still be in the shell of an imac or an imac pro but i believe it will still be performing much better in video editing with just a slight increase in gaming through apple's arcade so many sources are saying that a new high-end imac which is the imac pro should be coming in the fourth quarter of 2020. now it starts adding up fall of 2020 an improved imac with better gaming performance it really now shows that a new imac pro is coming later this year and we should expect some incredible changes keep in mind that apple's goal was never and never will be to compete against high-end gaming computer manufacturers now what do you think do you think you would be getting this gaming imac or or not let me know in the comments down below it's not over yet we get more information from nine to five mac about a new mac os messages app well it will not be entirely new they are going to use this exact same messages app you have on your iphone and just stick with that so that's just a little something that will make the messaging on mac a better experience well if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when i release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and i'll see you in my next video [Music] you
