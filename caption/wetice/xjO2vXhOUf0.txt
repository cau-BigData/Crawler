hello everyone welcome to Hong Kong welcome to the Hyatt Regency in Hong Kong which is going to be my office my room my everything for the next forty days now previously for those that don't know I made a series where I was house hunting in Hong Kong and I also talked about in one of my previous videos that I might be moving to Hong Kong but that would be kind of stupid to say that I might be when I'm already here now the view is gorgeous here if I just open this up you cannot see anything because of how bright it is outside but the view is beautiful I promise you that one thing that I want to just say here is that now I'm in Hong Kong that's settled I'm going to be moving into my house in about 40 days so we're having the handover day is on the 16th of December but all the furniture from Europe by boat is going to be here probably 10 or so January so until then this is going to be home for it for now and then we're gonna be moving in so of course I didn't show you in the house-hunting series the final home because I didn't want everyone to know where I live but for sure expect a kind of vlog because we're going there tomorrow for example I don't know when you're gonna be watching this so like tomorrow probably means nothing but today's the 1st of December and tomorrow's the 2nd of December so that's when we're going so see a vlog that's going to come out soon maybe after this video who knows that will show you the house all I can say is that it's a huge house with a garden in the Gold Coast not in Australia in Hong Kong there are we kind of stupid to be in Hong Kong it's the same anyway so that's just what I wanted to tell you guys I also wanted to tell you guys that I'm very very happy for all the support I've been receiving on my recent videos it's been incredible so we're at about six hundred sixty subscribers at the time of this recording plus - I don't know how it's gonna go through the next few days a lot of watch time a lot of views just like you you guys have been watching my videos it's been amazing that's I'm pretty much speechless and I'm already excited and looking forward to the 700 subscriber milestone that's gonna be the first milestone that I'll hit in Hong Kong which is that's cool that's really cool and hopefully it would be my dream if before my birthday the February 21st we could hit a thousand subscribers which would be amazing that would be really really really really cool as you can see but yeah so Hong Kong you expect some vlogs from here it's a cool place even though worldwide people say that there's a lot of protests and a lot of stuff like that yes there is there's a lot of destruction going on but it's not as bad as you think so for example in the hotel I got a paper a letter that like there's gonna be some protests in central which is actually right right there because I have the view of central which is just there and honestly it's yeah if you avoid those protests and I've been getting these questions on Instagram quite a lot so if you avoid those protest areas then you're fine then nothing is going to happen to you also Hong Kong prevents you to get out on the stops of Metro or whatever if there's a protest going on so they really try to keep you safe in one way or another but now after the election everything seems to be going well there's a lot less protests and you know you don't even see them anymore I mean if you go to the area then yeah you'll see them but now not really I mean when I was here in August and then in October I saw many but now it's as if nothing happened now of course for Hong Kong that's bad news and you can even see it on the streets there's almost no one in the city no almost no tourists for example the the Hyatt is empty like there's almost no one in the hotel which is kind of weird and freaky but honestly it's going to be okay that's what everyone says but it's really going to be okay nothing really drastic is going on in terms of safety as look as long as you avoid those areas where there's a protest going on and if you don't get in middle of it then you'll be okay you can go and explore all that Hong Kong gives it's an amazing city that I love and yeah so just avoid do your own thing away from those protest areas and and you'll be fine well thank you very much thank you for the subscribers thank you for the watch time if you have any other questions about Hong Kong or anything like that put them in the comments down below I'll be more than happy to answer and I look forward to talking to you more in this hotel room this 20 square meter home for now anyway please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated let's get to a thousand subscribers and if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here I have no clue what that will be but just please click OK take care and I'll see in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
