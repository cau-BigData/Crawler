hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some exciting news about the air pods - we should be seeing new sound quality a new potential color and we've got also some details about the iPads so if you're excited about all of this then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news so in the past videos you've already heard about possibly design some health features hands-free Siri and better sound quality and water resistance which was a lot of speculation until today in this video we can finally say that the air pods - we'll be getting a better sound quality and a better water resistance we've got a new report from my smart price which talks about the air pods - in a lot of detail first of all they say that the general design will be pretty much the same there's not gonna be any crazy changes to the airport everything is gonna stay the same as your air pods look now however there will be a lot of changes on the inside which are pretty cool to talk about and I'm excited to share them with you as they will be pretty much a massive change to what the air pods can do and what they will be able to do for you a new color is coming at least that's what my smart price says we should be seeing the standard white color of the air pods and a new black color whether it be black or Space Gray is unknown but you should be seeing some kind of shape of black I would love seeing a Space Gray black because that's something I really love but let me know in the comments down below which color you would choose and whether you would even buy the new air pods we should be seeing an improved grip as the air pots can be pretty slippery at some times for example you're working out you sweat they get slippery since the finish is so nice that it's just so slippery and sometimes can slip out of your hands or whatever else so I haven't been very happy about the grip in the past but we should be seeing a new grip which will be a major plus to the air pods now let's talk about the insides so we should be seeing improved sound quality meaning that there's gonna be especially more bass to the sound I haven't noticed that if they were missing bass but the sound quality will probably overall be way better than in the past we'll be seeing new sensors in the air pods meaning that we may have some health features meaning like a heart rate monitor or something like that or even temperature monitoring but that's just speculation and I've heard about it a little bit but we can see and we'll see about that however we should be seeing some health benefits battery life will not change at least that's what my smart Christ says we should be seeing the same battery life in this device however I've been pretty happy with the battery life over the past two years they still hold battery life quite for quite some time and I'm not complaining at all however I've seen some degradation in the battery so the battery life could be increased as well however we don't know about that but there's a smart price we should be seeing just the same battery so let me know down in the comments how your battery life experience has been like and whether or not you'd like to see a bigger battery my smart price also talked about the price for the air pods which pretty much surprised me as they say they should be around $200 or $199 which is most likely what it's gonna be that's a $40 increase from what we've been seeing now I don't know how I feel about that it's a lot for just small earbuds unless they come out to be super cool with heart rate monitoring and all of that kind of features and still it'll be cheaper and getting an Apple watch for those people who want to have health features because the Apple watches around $350 minimum so it may be a good cheap option to have some health benefits the release date is pretty much unknown yet but they're saying we should be seeing it in the first half of 2019 or even spring during an March event many people are saying that we're gonna be seeing a March event by Apple releasing a bunch of new things including the air pods air power which is another thing that I want to talk about is coming it's not dead it's in production and we should be seeing it during the same event which may be in March let's talk about the iPads a little bit so the iPad Mini 5 is supposed to come out and it should be released during the March event as well the design will be pretty much the same except the microphone will be repositioned to a different side of the iPad down or up that's unknown but we should be seeing just that kind of improvement the screen size will remain the same as well as the bezel size and touch idea remains with the headphone jack and the only big changes do you probably seeing in your iPad Mini is that you will be probably upgrading to an apple 810 processor or the 8 and X so that's unknown as well but you should be seeing a processor in the a-10 series a price reduction is possible as well maybe it's can go down all the way to 3 $29 and then the basic iPads would go a little bit up as the screen size would get bigger and Apple really loves increasing their price when the screen is bigger but anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated about all the latest news and let me know down in the comments what you think about all of this that is coming anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music]
