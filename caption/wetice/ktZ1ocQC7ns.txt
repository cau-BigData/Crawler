did you know that water can kill you hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today i am going to be reacting to some think that seemed to you as if they would be harmless but they can actually kill you so that's kind of interesting because most of these I did not even know but some of them are ridiculous really ridiculous so the first one is you probably kind of see now on the screen what are these 20 cups of coffee now you know who dreams 120 cups of coffee in one day coffee great for making you feel more more alert and boosting your attention span and at the low and it low does it is perfectly safe at the high concentrations a caffeine can cause insomnia dizziness vomiting headaches and heart problems and too much in one sitting can be deadly so if you drink 120 cups of coffee in a day then you're gonna die probably unless they're like really like nothing just coffee and water but very little coffee and actually a three young men died in separate incident after each time mention of pure powdered caffeine and south and watching that's kind of yeah not really good now and I said water six liters of water can kill you now wait a minute I drink about I never drank six liters of water the 28 year old Californian Jennifer strange she drank six liters of water in less than three hours and died a few hours later so basically if you read this you're going to die because of water is featuring six features of course because basically doesn't it where to store the war to the brain will kind of died out to something like that so yeah it's not the not the best 48 teaspoons of salt can kill you you know 40 that's a lot that's like Norris death so much that's maybe even ha like the whole kind of a small part in what it is in that so much wow that's this condition is known as hypernatremia in milder symptoms include fatigue and weakness but if the condition worsens can leave procedures in a coma in rare cases death alright so it doesn't necessarily kill you but it's not really good for your body anyway 71 strength tylenol pills so each year roughly 460 Americans died over dozing of this medicine Wow and about why don't you give those deaths are extant okay so 150 people died and 460 Americans are overdose oh wow that's like wow who can how can you eat 71 pills okay yeah that's kind of dangerous 13 shots of alcohol and rapid succession Oh 13 shots you know drinking and very very slurred speech went with your memory leave in two thousand six hundred thousand twelve eighty eight thousand Americans died from excessive alcohol consumption Wow many of the deaths were caused by alcohol poisoning a glass of alcohol in the blood stream which can call the areas of the brain is control the functions that keep our bodies running like breathing and consciousness to shut down Wow alright so basically your body just shuts down randomly 22 Apple's can be deadly even though it you may think that there's nothing but it can be deadly so this is not no seeds contain trace amounts sugar cyanide compound that turned into the potentially lethal toxin hydrogen cyanide when it's processed in the body Wow one place on milligrams of cyanide per kilogram of body weight can kill so potentially 22 apples are deadly for you wow that's kind of even though you cannot even eat when I mean you would have to be crazy to in 22 apple in the first place but I guess or similarly large amount of crushed sharing peach apricot and plum tapes can also kill you the flu can kill some I mean thus who can kill you if you're about 65 years old but even if you're younger than 6 months can be deadly in 2006 more than 50,000 Americans died because of complications from the virus that's a lot who flew very very careful with your flow be careful the Sun can kill you about 2,000 American died of what CDC has called weather related causes storms floods exposure to extreme heat and cold Wow whoo that's death well so too much exposure to Sun can kill you wow that's that's interesting and I'll bet strange and weird and always like the Sun that keeps you warm and keeps you alive can also kill you well he stroked sunstroke Wow get to know but anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below it we greatly appreciate it and subscribe for more videos like this I've been enjoying doing these videos for you guys this is actually the fourth day in a row that I've made videos and it's really starting to be kind of fun and and I really like to to make these daily videos anyway it's not even over eyes to 10 more days to go so maybe this opinion will change every goal but first a I'm still keeping excited energetic and I still have many ideas to to just do videos on so yeah if you enjoyed thank you very much for watching and I'll see you next time [Music]
