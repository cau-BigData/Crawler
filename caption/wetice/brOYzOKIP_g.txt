hello guys welcome back to another video today is the best day ever I just reached 300 subscribers when I woke up this morning I looked at it and I just got another subscriber I don't know at what time actually precisely but I am just super thankful for every single person who subscribed to my channel it is a big deal for me reaching 300 subscribers I'm so grateful for every single one of you and I just want to share kind of my nine months how my nine months have been since 200 subscribers because actually I reached 200 subscribers around mid-march that's when I posted my video so that's all I can say I don't really know but like around March time I reached 200 subscribers it was the best thing ever and 300 is even a greater thing and it's just something that I'm super grateful for and in the past nine months my channel grew a crapload but actually it may not seem for some people like a lot but for me it's a lot now way back in March if we look at the total views per per month I was at about 2.5 to 3 thousand views a month which is a big deal for me I never thought that so many people would actually click and watch my video or it's gonna be multiple people but that's still a lot of people and right now as of this video last month I was at about 6.5 thousand views which is amazing so like when looking at social blade and all the stuff it's just really impressive to see now way back in March if we look at a total subs per month I was at about three now that sounds like not a lot but I've been pushing pushing pushing and got it up to 20 in August and right now it's about ten I'm super grateful for that I'm super happy for all of that that's just a big deal for me that I finally got many subscribers in a month 15 people it's a lot it's it's a lot for me and just this is just like an appreciation video and I want to share kind of the path to where I am right now because as you know my channel has been affected with monetization the monetization monetization B monetization and now I'm on my way to be monetized again now monetization is not the only reason I'm doing YouTube it's actually not the reason I do YouTube because I love it I love making videos I love sharing it with people and I love to see all the support you guys give me and it's just a big deal for me when look look I started my youtube channel in 2016 I've been monetize immediately now I understood YouTube's kind of idea that they don't want everyone to be monetized because there are channels were misusing that and so I went through it I was fine with it because I'm following my dream right and then they made a threshold of 10,000 views total video channel views so I reached 10,000 views last year in December actually beginning of December and I was super happy to be back in the partner program now let's go all the way to February actually my birthday February 21st and I received an email when I woke up I was reading my emails and I received an email that basically I was basically kicked out of the partner program and that was because the 10,000 views total were not enough to prevent people from just doing a bunch of crap on YouTube I understand that that's fully understandable I super M for it and it was just kind of like I've been monetized you want to monetize even if this is something like it's not a problem for me I still follow my dream I'm following my dream right now but it was just kind of like you already put me there Meowth you put me there again and then you threw me out again it would be nice to have seeing some kind of verification like you're posting your own videos like leave me alone but maybe that's not about that now I'm on my way to reach the new threshold I'm on my way to reach the new threshold of a thousand subscribers and for a thousand hours of watch time that's the new threshold as of like 2018 I'm on my way and I'm at 300 subscribers which is one which is like a really good start and I'm super happy for that and I really hope that within the future I can reach a thousand subscribers and actually I have set the goal that that by the end of next year like by the end of 2019 I want to reach the thousand subscribers and get back into the partner program that's a goal that I set and I hope it's realistic it's twelve months so I really hope I can reach about a thousand subscribers and four thousand of hours of watch time I'm about 50% for the watch time which I am super happy for it's all the contribution of you guys it's the people who watch my videos it's the people who click on my videos the people who like my videos and it's the people who subscribe after the video which I'm super super grateful for now this year I really want to improve my audience retention my audience retention is about 40 percent right now which is quite a lot for me actually um and actually enjoy that people actually spend I don't know it's like 40 percent watching the video now I want to improve on that next year to get my audience retention up and that results in more watch time which allows me to get back in the parking program I don't want to get into the parking program just to get monetize there are some features that I don't have access to right now that would be great to see and it would be nice to have and I am really looking forward to next year and hopefully after this video I would really appreciate if you guys watch the videos and see what I have to say so if you want to click away after a minute go ahead I'm not gonna tell you that but just try to watch the video and if you don't like it write a comment tell me what I can do to please you it's all about you guys I videos for you I don't make videos for my personal use I just love sharing the videos I make and I feel like they're good videos but that's everyone's gonna say that now I want to improve on that this year so like 2019 and I just wanna see your reaction and like be honest I won't mind just be honest with your responses and please ask your friend your grandma or everyone to subscribe it would be greatly appreciated and let's just go on this journey together I would be super happy and just yeah to the next year actually so okay well I am super excited for 2019 hopefully I can come back with a lot more videos of reaching some milestones of subscribers next one will be 400 and 500 and 600 and so on
