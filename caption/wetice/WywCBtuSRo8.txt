all right guys um how are you today this is completely a topic I wanted to avoid doing and talking about but it's been affecting me in some ways and I would want to talk about it with you guys and get your opinion on it so that's the plan now what I'm going to talk about you probably know from the title it's the YouTube flagging the videos that they are not ad friendly or whatever they call it and even though most of the videos they're flagged you know are really not advertiser friendly in my opinion maybe I don't know how that's going but that's a good feature to prevent different kinds of videos on YouTube but then it's a real pain in the butt if it happens to creators like me or like you so firstly whenever I upload a video now it always gets flagged as not advertiser friendly what's a gigantic pain in the butt to do something with it now I figured out that do you know there is like a request manual review or whatever they call it but they say that you know you need a thousand views in seven days for them to review your video but what I found out that if you even click that they will review your video even before that when I have the video private they will review it for some reason so that's at least positive and that way whenever my video goes out it is advertiser friendly but anyway this should not be happening I should not be clicking manual requests to review my video every single time when there's a video that's nothing wrong with it and it's just a standard vlog so I don't know for example I mean I was looking at it maybe it's because there's something dangerous in it or I don't know or something but then I compared two videos that had leagues same thing and one got flagged and the other did not I don't know so it's it's either that it's completely random that the machine chooses whatever video to to flag or it really works properly and and and it is working well but obviously it's not working for me at least and I even saw many creators to talk about this and I did not want to talk about it because it personally did not do anything to me for like the past two months that I've been monetized but it started affecting me now and it's really annoying so I just wanted to talk about this I know the first one that you probably hear this from I'll go be the last I don't know and it's really frustrating and annoying to be dealing with something like this on a regular basis because I need to put my video one day before I need to publish it to see if it's gonna get flagged and then I also have to request a review what takes about two three hours for it to resolve so there you go I need 27 hours or so to have the video on YouTube that I can physically then post it so if I make a video on this day and I posted on this day and tomorrow morning it's gonna tell me that my video is basically not advertiser friendly so I just want to share this is kind of a video that I don't usually make and it's kind of like a rant video I guess it's I don't make a fee I don't make too many I think I just made like one or two in the past so if you enjoy this kind of and actually talking about these kind of topics more often then bitch leave like down below and subscribe or let me know in the comment section down below and I will know if you want me to discuss about these kind of topics it would be kind of interesting to do it 2018 so yeah alright take care and I'll see you in my next video what's gonna be a vlog so you know just forget all this okay anyway next videos gonna be a blog so take care I'll see you next time
