hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some interesting news air power is actually coming it's not dead many people thought that air power is dead it's gone it's over no it's actually coming it is supposed to start production very soon and we should see it very soon as well now also new iPhone rumors about the iPhone X I or the XR 2 and all the other new iPhones have come out so we have a lot to talk about in this video let's talk about air power so it was supposed to come out in 2018 as all of you know but that did not happen because well it was overheating and Apple had some problems however since the beginning of 2018 Apple did not talk about it it did not talk about it to the press it did not release anything about air power and whether or not it should come but now production is supposed to start on January 21st 2019 so in about a week ish so we should start seeing the launch mid February or March when maybe Apple will do another one of their shows but that's just a guess we don't know about that but let me know what you think about this and if you're excited for air power and if you think this is true at all or it's just another kind of like happiness to come and then to go well let me know what you think now let's talk about the iPhones so the iPhones in 2019 so in September are supposed to have a triple camera setup which is quite impressive however only the max size so like you have now the iPhone X s max it's that phone that's gonna have a max that's the only one that's gonna have a triple camera setup the rest of them will have a dual camera setup so not nothing new but this is the time where Apple will actually make a difference except size in a phone so I don't know how I feel about that it's just different I guess now the old lad will stay on the higher model so like that phone xs and iphone XS max which will probably have completely different names in the next release and the iPhone XR 2 maybe will still stick with an LCD as it is cheaper and it's still going to be the budget like phone however the iPhone XR 2 is going to have a dual camera which is great for pictures and you have a great camera as well however that I think would dump the sales of the iPhone XS 2 because it there wouldn't really be a big difference except the LCD and OLED now as in every update since the processor will be a lot better probably will see an a 13 Bionic chip that means we're gonna have an improved face ID which will probably be more reliable and quicker but that's due to the processors improving and being better and better over time we should also see an improved Wi-Fi mode you so I didn't even know that Wi-Fi 6 is out if you you about that lets me know but I had no idea that Wi-Fi 6 is a thing but apparently Wi-Fi 6 supports lower latency faster speeds and a bigger range which is great for iPhones if you have a big house however I'm not sure if all of you guys have a router that actually supports Wi-Fi 6 and such speeds so I don't know if it would be useful at this moment or it would just have to wait for a little while or it would just be a feature like hey we have this and cool buy it for a premium and you can't use it yet because the routers are not out yet well anyway I would still get the phone like that if the router would come shortly but that would be really cool well anyway guys I hope you learned something new here I am super excited for air power to come out it's gonna be amazing as you can charge three devices at once your air pods your Apple watch and your iPhone it's gonna be super cool and I'm also excited for the new iPhones in 2019 but anyway I will see you in the next one so if you enjoy this one be sure to leave like down below and subscribes all greatly appreciate it okay bye [Music] you
