hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12 point for developer beta 3 it came out about a week after beta 2 today I'd like to talk about the changes performance battery life and some bug fixes but before we do please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously the first thing is in every update we have to go over into Settings General about and look at these software version we tap on 12.4 and we can see that we have 16 G 5 0 3 8 D and we have a long build number which means there will be a few more betas coming this could potentially mean that we would be running I was 12.4 at the same time as iOS 13 which would be something really interesting now let's go look at the changes the first thing is again in the About section all the way in the modem firmware as you can see we are at 1.0 6.0 2 and in the past we had 1.0 6.01 in beta 2 if you remember this should improve some connectivity issues if you had any now another really cool thing is if we go find the feedback app if you have a feedback app and as you can see the feedback app is a little bit changed the icon is changed for the feedback app and it is pretty much the first time I've ever seen it I can update for this app it looks more modern and has a more squared look which could potentially mean that this could be looking the same way in iOS 13 aside from these there isn't anything else to see here and no other changes but we can see that Apple is really waiting to release all the features in iOS 13 now the battery life so if we go back into settings and go look at the battery life this will load up and I've it I don't use my phone a lot well 3 hours a day or so but still I can survive about 2 days but if you use it for the whole day you should be able to last for a day and it's pretty much comparable to the previous betas I did not have any sort of downgrade in terms of battery life everything is working really well and I'm really happy about it and when it comes to performance I would say that I was to enforce faster than twelve point three point one obviously as I complain about that in the past it feels a lot it feels a lot smoother and quicker and you can really see this mainly in the animations when you're doing something it seems a lot faster and smoother however when it comes to connectivity so regarding Wi-Fi Bluetooth and cellular I have no problem with Bluetooth and cellular however Wi-Fi has a few issues for me as well and I've heard many people complain about this as well that Wi-Fi might not connect properly or you'd have to reboot your device then so just be aware of that but other than that everything else is running really well in beta 3 I am really happy about it there aren't any big issues so go ahead update if you can well this is the end of the video let me know how things work for you in the comments down below and also please check out my I was 13 videos if you're excited for those if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out a lot and this is it for this beta okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
