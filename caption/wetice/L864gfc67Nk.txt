hello welcome back to another video today it's Wednesday so I thought I would record something that's been happening on YouTube in the past few weeks what's been happening is YouTube's raising the threshold forgetting monetized on YouTube so let me explain what it is first so basically they want four thousand hours of watch time and 1000 subscribers so that you can get into the YouTube partners program what that means is that you're gonna get monetized and get a bunch of other features what I think about it that in the long run it will be great for everyone for every single small channel and for the whole YouTube as it is that's my opinion because you know there's only just so many advertisers on YouTube so they're just going to be distributed among a lot less channels than now so I think that all the creators will see increase of revenue what's gonna be great for them and then for me or other small channels in the future when we just get and build up higher and higher so this is also a great way to filter out a bunch of irrelevant not complying to terms channels that are just you know making it a platform really really bad it will also clean up a bunch of channels that are just here for the money and not for like because it's their hobby and because it's their passion and they want to just make videos so I think it's going to completely clear all these channels out and it's just gonna keep those who work hard and hard and hard just to get to the threshold and just continue and growing and growing and don't mind if it's the threshold or if it's no threshold I don't mind I made a video when they are made the threshold to 10,000 what was the first one and basically this is the same thing and I agree with it in the long run it's gonna be excellent for everyone it's just now that it's terrible and I don't understand why people are criticizing this move and I don't think that that's proper to do and I also read and I think it's I don't remember the percentage exactly but like 90% of the channels are 90% of the channels are making 2.5 euros dollars whatever per month so that's like you're not losing anything and if you're here just because of the 250 you know dollars and or euros or whatever then just stop just go away just don't do this if you hear just for that this is something that I don't like seeing I am here just to make content I love doing it and I will keep doing it so I don't care about that but the one thing that really annoyed me and and really made me sad about all this is that I when I joined YouTube there was no threshold whatsoever so I was monetized since like our one or no like after the review but whatever you get it so I was monetized that's like 24 hours then a year later or so they made this threshold to 10,000 so I was like yes great good idea it's gonna filter out a bunch of things but obviously it was not enough to keep all the bad things off of youtube so with this being said I got ramana ties a month and a half ago or so and that was like present given to me and now a one and a half month later they wanted back this is the principle when you give something don't take it back this is what really like frustrated me or not frustrated just like annoyed me and made me sad about all this situation then when you give something to someone don't expect to get it back but what can you do in this case but that's the only thing that I am really sad and annoyed about about the whole situation so but this being said this is my opinion on this I think YouTube is not hurting small channels your may we are making such a sick slow amount of money per month that you don't even you cannot even do anything with it you'd have to wait I don't know whole year more than a year to to get the money because they pay it out so you're not losing anything and if you think that you're losing just stop quick away if you think that you will manage to get to the threshold and go further and further and build your audience then stay here but this is all I will say so if you enjoyed this video this is another round video I've been making many of them recently so yeah this is kind of a reaction all right take care and I'll see you in another reaction video like this or in another vlog or in another video so if you enjoyed leave a like and subscribe down below it would be greatly appreciated you know let's get to the thousand subscribers and I'll see you next time bye
