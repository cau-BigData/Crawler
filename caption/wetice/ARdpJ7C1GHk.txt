what's up guys we have our first look at the prototype for the iPhone 12 pro we have leaks about an additional lens there are upgrades to the core components of the cameras and the ultra wide lens is getting bigger which will allow for some really cool features all right let's break it down so the story behind the leak is very very interesting a couple days back it was tweeted by at Chaco bit on Twitter who already shared many details that were very accurate 9 to 5 Mac came with a report sharing this prototype image and saying that it's actually accurate however this was shared on Instagram a week before by concepts iPhone moreover with many sources like Ben Gaskin and Mac's wine back agreeing it might be quite valid further max wine back said that it's a legitimate image from an iOS 14 built and it may or may not resemble the iPhone 12 so the general say here is that it's real but it could be one of the many prototypes Apple is currently working on basically it just gives us some sort of an idea of what to expect looking at the prototype you probably already noticed the component with number 8 going to it we know that it's the heavily rumored lighter sensor that we first saw on the 20/20 iPad pro however this is not new 9 to 5 Mac previously found this in the iOS 14 code further detailing that it will be available not only on the iPhone 12 pro but on the iPhone 12 from Mac's as well you can see that there will be three cameras and a lighter sensor not four cameras we have absolutely no leaks about a fourth camera coming to the iPhone this year but it could be in the future further we can see that the side button remains exactly the same but the curvature of the iPhone is very similar to the iPad pro the iPhones usually had flat edges but Ming Chico has been saying for many now that the iPhone 12 will resemble closely to the iPhone 4s design but keep in mind again this prototype might be only one of the many in the works so the iPhone released in September might not resemble it entirely so what do you think the cameras will be moving again this year so do you like the iPhone 11 pros cameras positioned or the new positioning with the iPhone 12 pro let me know in the comments down below staying on the topic of cameras the ultra wide lens will be getting long and needed upgrades its low-light performance currently is very bad so with the lens getting bigger it will allow for better pictures however man Chico is saying that this upgraded ultra wide-angle lens will be only coming to the highest and iPhone basically the iPhones off from Mac's but last year we heard many of the same stories and the features ended up being on both pro models so I would strongly believe that we might end up seeing this upgrade on both models even more the optical stabilization will be replaced by the new sensor shift stabilization which basically stabilizes from the inside however the details about this are not very clear and we don't really have an understanding of how it will work just yet alright if you enjoyed this video then you know what to do please leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you my next video [Music]
