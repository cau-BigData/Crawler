hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got another iOS update we've updated to iOS 12 point to beta 2 it's out for the developers and I didn't think there would be any changes however there are a few and it's a pretty minor update altogether so lets me know if you're excited by leaving a like down below and subscribing for the latest news just to stay updated now let's get into the new features and changes there's a new control center music icon airplay icon there's a new animation in the control panel when your air playing or something like that if you're playing music on your speaker or if you're on your TV there's a different icon it's kind of lighting up blue and it's quite interesting the music app has been changed a little bit there are new animations which is not a huge change but there are still some cool features there that you can the animation is just faster better it's not so plain and boring anymore we have some UN emojis actually for new and emojis we have a giraffe we have a shark and a bunch more just so you can play around and send it to your friends have fun with that super cool to see some new end emojis I don't know if this is a bug or a change or something new is that when you're charging your phone it's gonna show you the battery level however even if you unplug your phone it'll normally show you the date but now it just shows you the battery level so I don't know how I feel about that because sometimes I just click on my phone to see the date and now I just see the battery level so it could be a bug it could be a feature however I don't really like it as I really like the date there and now you really have to go to you have to unlock your phone and go to the calendar this is for all your users who are with AT&T in the US there has been a 5ge icon which is quite interesting but it's actually not 5g it's just faster 4G it's just the same thing actually it's just they had a kind of an issue with their 5c II which is kind of stupid because 5g is not everywhere yet I've also got a new modem firmware update for all those people who had some connectivity issues including me because I seen that the Wi-Fi has been dropping the call were not the best sometimes I could not call this should just fix all the connectivity issue that you've been having with Wi-Fi and cellular it's just a good fix now I believe that the FaceTime bug has been addressed in this update but I was expecting an iOS 12 point one point four for all the public which would fix this but I don't know Apple addressed this issue I think it's fixed here and we should be seeing an iOS 12 point one point four soon so you guys would have that updated as well unless they did an own server fix that's unknown you just tested out maybe and see yeah if the other person still hears you or sees you let's talk about the performance the performance is quite good it feels fast it feels solid there are new animations it just doesn't feel that performance will sacrifice and I feel it's it's fast however I've just had it for a couple minutes now probably half an hour to an hour so our pressure tested out more and talked about it in a future video battery life is quite the same I guess even though I've not tested much yet I believe that it could be better because I've had some problems in the previous updates even though I said that my battery life was good it was actually a little bit worse than before but now let's hope that the battery life is actually fixed and you have more battery overall well that's everything for this update it should be coming soon to the public beta so just stay tuned for that and yeah if you found something else let me know in the comments down below and let me know how it's been working for you anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay informed about everything that's coming and all the latest news but anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Music] you
