[Music] this is our Scotland trip this is where we went this is where we stayed and this is how we got there all in this video firstly we went on a plane from Vienna to Edinburgh Airport we had a pretty casual slide the pretty casual takeoff and a really nice flight it was quite a nice flight and it was my first time going through Great Britain all the way to Edinburgh as you arrived we picked up our bags and went to Edinburgh Airport Car Rental Center then we arrived to our car what we got from a rental company called Enterprise I started chatting about the car and it was a nice blue Ford we got set up we had all our computer and laptop inside as the GPS and that's what took us all over Scotland we proceeded to drive on the wrong side of the road we were completely confused and as not having the habit to drive on this side of the road it was a hell of a ride we almost had a crash with a semi then we got to the center of Edinburgh and that's where things started to be interesting I really had to concentrate myself doing the GPS work from the computer otherwise we were completely lost we need to find our hotel we're going to the hotel we're going to check-in we're going to leave our back and we're going to go see our next location for this vlog we arrived to the hotel very nice hotel with of the elevator and went to up to our room then we went back down and we had a drink then we left the hotel and we want to walk around the city of Edinburgh it was a really really nice walk from the hotel we went up to see it in work from a height then we saw also some kind of Cathedral it was really nice too [Music] the next day we left the hotel and scared to be in the car we went through Edinburgh and left Edinburgh and we set off to ghosty 2 for 3 [Music] great now I don't know I think it's Queens mary's bridge or something like that I just read signs and I don't know if I'm I'm not very good at sign the names relax the bridge and continues and arrive to our next stop the aperture castle as you can see half of its been destroyed and half of it then rebuilt this was an awesome trip to come here and I really recommend you to go check this castle out when you're ready we left the castle and followed the road again and we arrived to a birders silver sand beach or something like that it was a beautiful place after the beach we decided to drive and we stumbled on the bridge that took us across and it took us dandy the GP right in front of us and that's where our hotel we arrived at the hotel we were walking and we came to our room it was quite the cozy room nothing to complain about it was a fine hotel we went nowhere the evening because it looks like an industrial city so we stayed at the hotel and stay over in the morning we left Dundee and we set off to go see the fiddler ki dam and fish ladders [Music] we arrived to the damage agency everyone to look around and we attempted to climb all the way to the top don't worry it was legal we took the stairs all the way up so it was great [Music] after looking around we continued the road and arrived to dowel distillery that was in daleney now we looked around there also we just went inside to just see what was in there and it was a perfect place for whisky lovers we left the DAO in the distillery and we went through the Highland and we arrived to our Bear Lodge which was quite interesting to get in I don't know if we are in the great what but we just walked into someone's place it was the correct place and this is where we ended off our Thursday in the morning we left the Bear Lodge and we continued our route this day we did not have much planned but we came up to some kind of C River logs area and we just took a while to enjoy the breathtaking moment we even saw a weird cow then we followed the road and we arrived to Donovan Castle there we discovered they wanted 20 pounds to look at 20 rules in the chapel no thank you we looked at it from outside then it led us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then we arrived to the hotel after this amazing trip and the day was pretty much over for us in the morning we went back into the car and back on the road to go enjoy some more of this beautiful cotton nature [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] after this amazing Traverse we arrived to another amazing spot and it's called alien Donnan after the castle we arrived to our hotel and we stayed there it was overlooking la o'clock the next day we woke up with ugly weather let's say this way we had to stop for a coffee because it was ugly weather but we continued our trips and when to just look around and we just followed the road [Music] eventually we got to a dirt road where the GPS told us to go what was quite impressive and we did not have a 4x4 it was amazing we dropped some stuff at the hotel and then continued the road and this is where we arrived this is breaking [Music] and this is where the day this is our last day in Scotland and we enjoyed it on their own we went on the highway and we saw the bridge we saw at the beginning of this trip and this is where the last day in Scotland ended well it's time to leave so we went through the departure hall and back to the airport and headed north all the way to get to the plane [Music] please [Music] I want to be [Music] and we landed in Vienna after the entire seven days of this
