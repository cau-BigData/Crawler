hello guys welcome back to another video so if some of you watched the Apple event already then you know the amazing things that Apple released in this amazing event so as you know two new Macs came out one being the MacBook Air and the other being the refreshed MacBook Mini which the last one was updated in 2014 so it was right about time to update that one then you also know the iPad pro came out with amazing new features and I'm gonna talk about all that in this video so the MacBook Air has been here for a while now being a very compact and really portable device where you can carry all around so it has three new beautiful finishes and a beautiful new display that removes the edges which was kind of disgusting for me and now it's really looking like the MacBook Pro with a beautiful space great color as well it has a 13.3 inch display so it's a really good size display with 4 million pixels and 48% more color in your photos and pictures and everything which is massive a change on the display touch ID finally came so basically you can unlock your computer with your fingerprint or you can pay you can do a bunch of things just with your finger but the audio is also better by 25% so if you want to watch videos play music it's gonna be way better than before it has better connectivity you can plug away more things and the big thing it has an 8 gen CPU so a little bit better than the previous one for doing all of your daily life tasks that you need to do on your computer with your daily tasks you need a battery life so there is an all-day battery life which you have which takes you through the whole day and the computer is more portable and lighter which is way easier for traveling and portability and all this starts at 11 $99 so the other Mac that was released is the Mac Mini which is great that it's been updated after four years now it has a beautiful space gray finish which I love space great so it's really beautiful it has a four to six cores which you can choose which are up to five times faster than the previous Mac Mini you can have up to 64 gigabytes of RAM whereas the old one supported only up to 16 gigabytes of RAM so you can really see that performance wise you're gonna have a way better specs you also get a one gigabit internet port but that's gonna be upgraded to a 10 gigabit port for like super great speeds and all this starts as well at $799 but can go up depends on what you want to have a new iPad that was supposed to be announced that's something I've been waiting for I thought they would release more iPads than just the iPad pro but the iPad pro has some massive changes which are really cool to see now you got an edge to edge display which is really beautiful with a liquid Retina display so you're still having an LCD display it did not go to all that yet with the edge to edge display the home button disappeared so all you can do is use gestures to swipe as you would do on your iPhone X you've got face ID therefore you can unlock your iPad using face ID the iPad can also be in whatever orientation it's going to unlock so that's super cool to see the camera is way better you have smart HDR you have all the new features and the gestures as on the iPhone X now the big thing is you have an a 12 X Bionic chip which has 10 billion transistors and is even faster than the a 12 Bionic that's in the iPhone X in excess of max so that's like wow so you have an 8 core CPU and a seven core GPU which both are like 2 times faster than the previous iPad pro which is impressive and with all this processing power you still have an amazing all-day battery life for those people who want more storage in their iPads you now have one terabyte of storage possible so wow that's a lot of storage in a such a small device finally USBC is starting to come in to Apple so maybe we'll see more and more devices with USB see later on but the iPad pro has USB C which can connect to your camera it can even charge your phone and it can connect to 5k displays to do some video editing and whatever stuff you want to do augmented reality has come to the iPad as to all the iPhone excess excess max and so on and Bluetooth 5.0 which will give you better connectivity and way better performance with your ear pods it has great gaming capabilities you can play many games at super high frame rates and it's even better than your ps4 or whatever you have so wow that's a massive change and also for me it's great to see that there's Photoshop on the iPad pro since you can edit everything on your iPad Wow and all of this is well starts at $799 and you can order this today as well and have it in a week so all this really is impressive so with these you have two versions you have the 11 inch display and the 12 point 9 inch so one smaller one bigger one but it's only 2 inches but it's wow this is really cool and the last thing they released is iOS 12.1 for everyone now which basically brings grouped FaceTime isom support and many more features to iOS so it's really impressive to see all of this and I'm excited for their next show anyway if you enjoyed this video please leave a like down below and subscribe and I'll
