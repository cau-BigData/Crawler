hello everyone and welcome back to another video in this video I'll try to briefly explain my video workflow so the first step I do to make my videos is write a script so write a script on my laptop something similar to this so for example this one was for the installation of iowa's 13 there are just some notes or it's gonna be just anything from bullets points when I'm recording over top for like iOS videos or it's gonna be a full-blown text then I read off of my teleprompter that is right in front of the camera right over here and that text is portrayed from this iPad here so basically what it does it mirrors your text as you can see here this is like the teleprompter applications that I use it mirrors the text right over here when you're talking so let's see I'm talking I'm talking I'm talking and it's just going down it's a mirrored on to the mirror that I'm looking in right now for example for this video I'm not using a script because I'm just explaining something right very straightforward second step I upload it to my iPad I make it work I set the font and just start recording I use a lav I your microphone so I put that on me set everything up check the audio levels and I'm ready to record turn on the camera either read the text or look at the bullet points and so on so I record my arrow first arrow is the shot that is this one right and then Bureau would be an overhead shot with this camera for example or anything else like something I want to show in some of my videos that's called Bureau after I have completed recording my arrow I go and record the Bureau I'm then ready to go edit I then take the SD cards put it into my computer upload them on to my storage which is on route which is a raid array which basically allows for the safety of your files so basically your data is not on onedrive it's on two drives simultaneously you can even have them on four and so on which is even more secure and then then I edit my video after I'm done editing my video I usually go render and kind of go look around my studio kind of like clean it up a little bit very simple right over there once it's rendered I go and work on my thumbnail I can either take a picture from the video or I go take a random picture from that scene or something completely else so thumbnails are very important as well for your videos because they are the ones which the viewers see first and that's really important so I usually now on my iowa's videos have an overhead shot ranging from anything any feature that I love the most or anything that just makes sense to be as the thumbnail I hate clickbait thumbnail those pissed me off then once I take the picture for my thumbnail I go to photoshop and edit the thumbnail right over there usually adding some text or no text at all or just blurring the background or doing anything like that I can either I can even just take a picture of a random background blur that and put an iPhone on top for example it ranges massively once I'm done with that I proceed to upload my video to YouTube by adding my tags my title my thumbnail and all of that and then in the end of the video I usually have a card saying like hey click this card over here right well then you go at that card usually I send you to a video that is something related to this or my previous video I add that there make it synced up and it works then for the end screen I usually have a playlist there which is something similar to what you watched and then I have applet then I have two videos which are something like the previous video and something that's recommended personalized to you which YouTube does and then from that you can click on separate videos then a couple days weeks after I usually go back to that video and see the watch time duration and then I go and put a card where most of the viewers leave that way I can attract more viewers to another video and kind of chained them up together you can see that in some of my previous videos very simple here once I upload all of this I take then copy the files that I have on my sis the end put on my storage system which is by QNAP once it's there it's raid it's safe and I keep all of my files for when I will need to use them again which happens many many times sometimes I have to go take another thumbnail from a previous video or just a segment from another video which makes sense to the video that I'm working on that's why I keep all of my files many people would say that is just a waste of storage it's not I find myself going back to 2016 for some Bureau footage of something I'm talking about or 2017 and so on there's always something that you want to get back and take instead of just deleting everything once you have completed the project very simple well this is the end of the video if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here that's what I mentioned but before you do please leave a like and subscribe for more videos
