hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today is going to be different than usually because today I would want to go somewhere with you guys we're not going to be here in the office recording something a reaction video what we're going to go somewhere and look around the one main thing we want to do today is best gps system for Scotland because we need one so we're going to test the software with it and we're going to see where it's going to take us we're going to go to Austria and then we're going to maybe go somewhere around hind board and see what we can see basically and we'll have lunch in something so this is going to be kind of like a vlog of today so it's going to be kind of science going to be something different since we've been doing kind of the same thing for quite a while now well some problems later we finally assault the speakers we're not working so now they're working reversing very grateful ok so we are sitting in the car we finally made it work so we have this kind of small GPS device from Garmin and we had a lot of trouble making this thing work and now it's gone please and now it's sitting there and it works so with our GPS system in our laptop it navigates us all over the place so it's perfect and you can download the map for whatever country pay for exactly and so this you can have on like cars trucks both another transport so it's going to navigate you if you have an external navigation system or I think in phone or you can make it work also cause you have until evolving into alternator now it's interrupting me and with location services on your phone it should work also ok so it's been moving a little bit now and so far the GPS no problems at all it's working it's actually going pretty well and we see everything really really good and its really accurate the position is just couple meters away so you really see where you're going and now we're actually coming close to handbook and we're going to go for lunch and then we're going to set the GPS a little more later on after you [Music] okay so GPS testing is over now but the only problem we have now is you want to go son we want to find somewhere to go eat and this is that kind of a problem that we're facing since probably one hour now and we cannot find anyplace because some of them are closed and our GPS systems just shows us like the place is near us and you know it's kind of weird and we cannot search so we are looking all over the place to find some kind of restaurant to eat and we may be found one now [Music] Oh [Music] well the place we thought we found that was a restaurant was not it was little the red zone but it was closed so again we're continuing our adventure to find a restaurant presence and the GPS is working still fine so did not disconnect the beginning what is really good all right so we just arrived to a steakhouse where we bring a little while back and it's I we both really good but now our only concern is if it isn't open and that's a good question because the restaurant here are usually open till 13th like still wanna at 1pm so that's going to be a good question [Music] and we're out from the restaurant this was one of the best steaks is well I had one already before sorry for the win and this is my second base this is the second time we've been here and it was really really good i recommended so is the steakhouse in austrian your pardon Dorf so you should go check it out it looks like that then it's over here so you can we can find it easily it's not not so you know you can find it okay so after a great trip today tested the GPS ate some good food and now it's time to end this vlog so if you enjoy it be sure to leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated I don't know how long this vlog is maybe short maybe longer I don't know i'm going to edit it and we'll see so so yea big here and i'll see you in the next video [Music] I ah [Music]
