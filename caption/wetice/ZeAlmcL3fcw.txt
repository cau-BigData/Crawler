hello everyone and welcome back to another video you probably already know that the higher and Huawei phones make amazing photos well in today's video we will take a look at how the iPhone XS competes against the Huawei P 30 pro first we must understand the hardware we are using the P 30 Pro comes with four cameras on the back and one on the front there is the wide-angle lens the ultra wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens and a hallway time-of-flight camera also called it tof camera you might be asking what is the to your web camera right well it's very very simple the tof camera takes care of the autofocus the contrast focus and Huawei's AI image stabilization these cameras come with an aperture of 1.6 to point 2 and 3.4 respectively on the other hand the front camera comes with a standard lens at 32 megapixels and a 2.0 aperture however the iPhone X s is very different on the back we have a wide angle and a telephoto lens at 12 megapixels each with an aperture of 1.8 and 2.4 respectively the front camera is a standard lens at 7 megapixels with an aperture of 2.2 as you can see there is a huge difference between these two phones we are testing today anyway let's begin take a look at this basic landscape wide angle lens photo next a regular photo of me on full auto next a portrait photo of me on full auto again next an aperture photo just on the huawei P 30 Pro and next a regular mode selfie next the portrait mode selfie of me and finally a panorama photo now before I get into all the details and my thoughts let me know what you think of all these photos and tell me which are your favorites in the comments down below starting off with the regular landscape pictures I don't really see a big difference at all I just prefer the image of the iPhone XS as the colors are more vibrant but both of them are great the portrait photos of me are again very similar however the colors on the iPhone XS are more vibrant again but the ones on the Huawei are more natural the aperture photo on the Huawei p30 Pro is just incredible I love it so much but unfortunately there's no aperture mode on the iPhone X s now this regular selfie is quite good on both phones on the huawei vil colors look less natural than on the iPhone XS it's kind of weird that these inverted when we switch to the front camera the portrait selfies are different on both phones as well on the Wow a p30 pro there is no background blur at all and the colors are different the iPhone excessive a ground blur but I prefer the Huawei p30 Pro in terms of colors over here and finally the panoramas they both look incredible on the iPhone accessories some weird effect on the windows whereas on the p30 pro there are none the colors on the iPhone access a ghin compared to the Huawei p30 Pro which makes the image way better now which phone actually won this competition that is pretty tough to say I bet the iPhone XS will get crushed in the night photography but in day photography it isn't bad at all and the iPhone access makes more vibrant images compared to the one of the Huawei P 30 Pro of course that is my preference and you might have a different one and that's why let me know in the comments down below which one you think won well thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this also if you missed my previous video on Huawei then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
