hello everybody today we're going to be talking about a very popular question and that is should you buy the iPhone XR or the iPhone XS which one should you get out of these so let's talk about that in this video so to start off the Equinix start has a bigger display than the iPhone X s with a 6.1 inch LCD versus a 5.8 inch OLED so you're losing a little bit on the display by having an LCD with the XR but I mean if you don't really if you're not looking for taking pictures and things like that then I think an LCD is quite good enough now a big difference here is that the iPhone exa has a lower resolution compared to the iPhone XS and not a fully edge-to-edge display with the exercise you don't get a display that's edge to edge it's just a little bit off because of the LCD display whereas you have a fully edge to a display with your OLED XS both of them have true tone the iPhone XR has just a 112 megapixel camera whereas the iPhone Nexus S a dual 12 megapixel camera one wide angle one telephoto so it doesn't really make a difference unless you want to make pictures because the single 12 megapixel camera is still a really good camera with the camera you still have portrait mode with depth control and smart HDR in your pictures you still have the bokeh effect which is adjustable and you have smart HDR which combines the pictures to give you one amazing picture you have the April Bionic chip so you don't lose anything you still have a very powerful chip as if you would have the elephant excess or excess max so processor you're not losing anything they say the improvements have been added in both so you don't lose anything your face ID is improved fast charging has been added to both of them and maybe a 10 watt charger later on but we don't know that so one big change is that the iPhone XR is the ip67 water-resistant which means it can be only in a 1 meter of water for 30 minutes compared to the ip68 on the iphone XS which is up to 2 meters now both of them are 64 gigabytes 128 gigabytes and 256 gigabytes option so you can really choose on all of them now another change is the LTE on the iPhone XL you get LTE advanced and on the iPhone excess you get gigabit LTE so there's an improvement with the gigabit LTE but I mean I don't think it's going to be very significant and I don't know where it's available yet so I don't know if you'd have a good experience with that at the beginning they both have bluetooth 5.0 which is the new bluetooth and iPhone XR has haptic touch versus the iPhone XS which has 3d touch so how thick touch I mean I don't really know the difference we're gonna see that because I'm planning on getting the iPhone XR I think it's just going to be very similar to the 3d touch but I don't know what's gonna be the iPhone access has an HDR display which is little bit better compared to the XR now the battery life the XR has 1.5 hours more of battery life compared to the iPhone 8 plus which is the one I currently own that's a big improvement that that leads like yeah that's quite a massive for the day the iPhone XS has only 30 minutes more compared to the iPhone X I guess if you're looking for more about your life then get the iPhone XR but if you're just looking to upgrade your iPhone eggs to something that I don't believe is a good option as I thought about that in the previous video so really the iPhone XR is for really the people don't want to spend a lot of money and want to have many of the features that the iPhone X and XS in X's Macs have but the climbing it's kind of small - is that you don't have an edge to edge display but I guess that can be I mean it's not a very big deal you still have a great display if you're looking for a bigger phone as well get the XR or get the excess max which is like 1,300 $1,500 which is too much whereas the iPhone XR with a bigger display at 6 foot 1 inches is at $749 starting I personally would get the XR right now but if you have deep pockets and why not just go all out and get the iPhone excess max where you're gonna get a lot of improvements anyway this is it for this video if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time bye
