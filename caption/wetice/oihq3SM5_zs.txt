alright hello guys and welcome back to another video on this beautiful day how are you today I'm fine I hope you're fine as well today I'm going to talk about this camera right here that you're watching me from yeah something like that I'm going to talk about the light performance of this camera so I use only manual settings I'm on ISO 400 but I have two big soft boxes here and a softbox above me so I mean that's not a proper test right so turn them off well I am back at ISO 400 but no more light on if just the life that I have in my room so as you can see it's not the best so ed let's go higher on the ISO so from 400 I went to a thousand you can see that it's still I mean you can make me out I'm here high you can kind of see me but it's not the best alright so I jumped to 2000 right away this is what it is on two thousand so you can kind of start seeing me a lot better now let's go to 3000 so here we are in 3200 really kites starting to be better but of course there's not so much light in my room so yeah this is 3200 it's really I mean it's starting to be good all right so we're on 8,000 now as you can see this is probably how are you had it before so 8,000 does the trick on the 60 with kind of it's a ten-year-old lens on it with aperture off I don't even know 3.5 to 4.5 so I mean it's not the best I of course need the lights but as you can see it performs really well and I can go all the way to 12,500 so I stuff space to spare space to spare yeah I still have space to spare but of course more I saw the less quality so you don't want to do that you want to put more light but as you can see the 6d performs are really well anyway but let's turn the lights on now so now if I would stay at 8,000 you can see it's overexposed so let's go back to 400 and so we are back to where we were before so of course it's better to have soft boxes so I don't recommend not to have soft boxes or souring light even the ring light is great I kind of over over exaggerated with soft boxes to have two in front one on top it really lights it up there's no shade whatsoever behind me which is great so the 60 passed the test it's really great for low light I mean you can take beautiful night photographers pictures I'm going to put some of them now here and here so as you can see they're really beautiful I those were taken in Austria in like December so really nice low-light pictures on bulb of course but it works really well I'm no complains there so using the sixty-four vlogging for anything the light performs outperforms any other camera the g7x I mean the g7x is a lot grainy at night when it's like really dark but I believe this one was the same but a little less but I mean it works really well so on this game run six you can go all the way to 12,500 and during pictures 225 no to 40,000 so that's impressive I really enjoy this camera to have pictures and videos in low-light I love doing that sometimes I like being in like a chill mood I'm planning to like be changing little bit of my lighting but it's really good I really like it this camera passed the test so I do recommend this for light this camera is working really well but it's will do it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video bye [Music] [Music]
