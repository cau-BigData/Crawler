hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released their new air pods air pods who are finally out we have been waiting for this for quite some time now we have been talking about rumors in the past and they're finally out now I would like to cover the three models that we see now that Apple released on their website but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more let's get into this so as I said there are three versions of the air pods - there's the hundred $99 version of air pods - which is the full version so the new version with the charging case however there is another version so don't get confused that is for $158 which is only air pods - without the wireless charging case and then finally you have for $79 you have just the wireless case for your already purchased air pods one I know this is confusing but Apple did it this way so for the people who don't want to get rid of their air pods one they can just get the case with the wireless charging even though it's half of the price of the air pot so I don't know how worth it it actually is there aren't as many changes as I expected either there is just a new h1 chip which had never heard of but apparently it's way better and way cooler or whatever or some stuff like that this also allows you to get 50% more talk time on the phone which potentially could result in better battery life as it improves that as well another big feature is the updated version of bluetooth it goes from bluetooth 4.0 to 5.0 which means that it's gonna pair way quicker it's gonna go across devices way quicker and it's just gonna make the whole pairing process a bunch easier for you as you know this was kind of slow in the past sometimes it took a couple of Seconds to register on your iPhone or move over from your iPhone to your MacBook or stuff like that so this is finally a lot faster now and you'll be a much happier with that now one big feature that I really enjoy is hands-free Siri hands Wistaria allows you to just say the magic words and she will come and you can talk to her without having to double tap your ear pods so that is an amazing feature that I will take opportunity of because it it just say like hey da da da and it just makes your life a lot easier than double tapping also one thing that apparently is new you can engrave a custom message on your ear pots too which will potentially ruin the resale value but if you're that type of person who wants to add a custom message then go ahead you can do that now well this leads me to the part of the video where is it worth it to upgrade to the new air pods well for those that don't have air pods at all yeah it's a great idea if you've been following the rumors and waiting for air pods to and it's the right time to go now purchase them and you will be happy however for the people who already own air pods one then there's only a couple of reasons why you should update one is if your battery is really degradation and you just need a better battery so that it has more about you life then yeah you should go ahead and upgrade as it's gonna help you a ton and also for those people who want faster pairing hands-free Siri faster cross device switching and wireless charging so for that all depends on what you actually want and series started talking but it's all depending on what you want to do with your new air pods so up to you but I think I consider it worth it well this is the end of the video so I would love to know what you think about the new air pause and whether or not you're gonna be getting them in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay I will see you in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
