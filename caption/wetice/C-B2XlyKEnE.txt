hello everyone and welcome back to another video today as another video we're going to be unboxing the Apple pencil that I am holding right over here so we previously unboxed the iPad pro that I am holding right here and a pencil goes well with it right so Apple pencil this is the packaging that you have right over here with it saying Apple pencil nothing really special about the packaging right but let's get into the opening so peel off this little plastic ends with pretty much every other unboxing and we can see this box now beware it's also written on the back of this it works only with the iPad pro 11 inch and the iPad pro 12.9 inch third-generation so be careful with that jhope in this box it is just a little slide out to open up another box that is right under and so now we've got our little paperwork right here which we can go check out it just says Apple pencil and some other papers not very important but here's the pencil this is the Apple pencil second-generation right over here so it just says Apple pencil right over here whereas the first generation would have a loop around saying Apple pencil so this is the new Apple pencil pretty much looks a little bit the same except it has this little hitch here which I will show you what it does right now so after the unboxing the box is pretty much empty now how does this work first we're gonna peel off this plastic that protects it so now we're going to take our iPad pro 11 inch or 12 point 9 inch I'm gonna put it down so that you can see better now I'm going to show you before we start setting it up why we have this little hitch so you just have to place your pencil on top and it's magnetic you literally just place it on top and that is it so now I had a little bit of an I can show up here I'm just gonna put the brightness to max as you can see when I put the pencil on top it is actually charging so let me show this to you so as I put the pencil on top magnetically it shows up Apple pencil is at 60% that's pretty much straightforward to check if your Apple pencil is working just go on to bluetooth and it's going to show you that Apple pencil is connected pretty much simple and it charges from the battery of your iPad so beware that it'll kind of take some battery so if you open up a new node and select a new sketch as we want to sketch something the Apple pencil should be working immediately so of course as you can see I can touchscreen so I pretty much works as expected let me just select the another sketch and to show you how it works so pretty much you can select your tools of course I'm not running iOS 13 yet but I'm gonna for sure install it just after this video which the tools look a little different but you select the color you can do something with your marker you have your pencil then you have your highlighter which is quite important to have as well and you can of course change the color as much as you want and do anything you want now of course if you double tap you can go into eraser mode which allows you to erase if you double tap again you go back to the tool you used previously so let's say I'm using the pencil now so I'm just gonna drive I'm just gonna draw hello basically if I double tap it goes to the eraser I can erase what I've wrote and if I double tap again I go to the pencil which was the last thing I used pretty much very straightforward now the pencil I think now the pencil I think works everywhere on your iPad so you can do anything you want with the pencil without having to use your finger which is quite cool I guess but of course once you're done just click done and you have your you have your drawing right over here but of course you can also draw in the simple notes section well then this is pretty much everything right over here you cannot swipe up but I mean that's fine and when you're done you just put your pencil back up and it's always charged and for you to use well this is the end of the video if you enjoyed then please leave a like and also if you want to see the Apple pencil functionality in iPad OS more precisely then let me know in the comments down below and I'll be sure to do that okay take care and I'll see you in another video [Music] you
