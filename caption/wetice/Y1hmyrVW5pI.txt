hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today it's an awesome day again I love this egg show it's you it's not the same but today is an awesome day well I'm excited was an awesome day for me today is Monday and today we're going to record something today I would want to talk about I was 11 most annoying features I have like a couple months of iOS 11 so I kind of know the lay of the land of iOS 11 so I found that what I cannot stand about iOS 11 and if you can't stand this I would not update because it's stupid but anyway let's just get into the video so five features that should not be feature as well they're the worst features number one is night shift now I like to use night shift because basically usually it should be accessible somewhere in the control panel where I have no idea where it should be normally I just want to click on it and like have night shift on like it was before now you just have to 3d touch the brightness bar and it's here so that's like the stupidest thing ever it's just so stupid stupid so and then you turned off its just so that's more complicated than just having it here it's just Apple Steve number two what's like the most hilarious thing ever now this is what I want to show you so if I click on the Bluetooth sign there we go now it's it's it should be on okay so if I just open like the settings and let you see so it's on yes you see it's on now if I go back to the control panel and I look I want to turn it off I don't want Bluetooth anymore I just click on Bluetooth now I go back to settings and guess what Bluetooth not off it's just not connected now I mean okay great feature that disconnects you from something but well instead of switching the Bluetooth off you - it doesn't you have to go to the settings and it's just another step so why why do you do that then that's the exact same thing with Wi-Fi so if I click on Wi-Fi normally to turn on and it should be connected to Wi-Fi now if I see here it's connected now if I wouldn't turn Wi-Fi on because I want to go to cellular well yeah I can disconnect and then it goes to whatever cellular but it's disconnected it's not up it just says not connected I don't want that I want if I want to like click that button that's purely to disable Wi-Fi to turn it off and the same thing with Bluetooth shut up phone that's just what what I want anyway one more there's okay third one when you take a screen shot so let's take a screen shot okay there's this stupid thing here in the corner what leg goes away after like five seconds and it just annoys the crap out of if you want to take multiple screen shots you just have to like slide it out or something but it's just annoying it it's another annoying thing why why do you do that go away it's just stupid again another stupid feature don't put that there why would you do that so if you take a screenshot then just go to photos to look at your screen show that stupid stupid now one thing that was struggling to find is auto brightness now normally it was on though it was under display and brightness well guess what it's not there anymore where is it good question I don't even know now so what I have to do is just go to search bar and type auto brightness so if here where is it where did what wears out you see I can't even freaking find it also brought display so it's even in here this placard of accommodation just hidden and freaking nowhere this why so I think mail accounts before you just went to mail and you just found like on top still count things and you just add email addresses because it makes sense to be under mail well no just put it under accounts and passwords yes so actually it puts it next to everything pretty much everything okay well sorry for such a cut my battery just died so anyway as I was saying these features are stupid that's why I don't like these features that doesn't make sense anyway I was 11 great great but there are some stupidities some stupid things that are just so stupid anyway if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if you want me to like you know as new versions come out because I'm subscribed to the beta program I'm just gonna be looking at these there's stupid stupid stupid anyway anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
