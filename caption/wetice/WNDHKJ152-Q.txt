hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 13.1 beta 3 for the registered developers just a week after beta 2 let's take a look at this update as well as a prediction when iOS 13.1 now let's go take a look at the features and changes so the updates came in about two hundred eighty five point nine megabytes on my iphone XS but as you know that varies on which device you have or which version you're coming from now if we go into settings general about and we click here we can see that a build number is 17 a 58 37 a the a at the end means that we are getting close to the final release of iOS 13.1 but we should still see a few betas now the first change i've noticed is this change here so this is the image you're looking at of the Apple TV icon in beta 2 now it looks like this in beta 3 as you can see the blue went to white and it looks more simple and more stylish in my opinion representing their new service of Apple TV now the mail app is fixed as well everything seems to be working really well in the mail app I have no more bugs and as you know the mail app was the buggiest app in iOS 13 point oh and thirteen point one and also many bugs in this beta have been fixed and it seems to be a lot smoother than before which I'm really happy about some people had trouble opening the App Store from the iMessages app but now you can do that easily and it seems to be working as you would want it to work and it seems quite fast now I know that many of you were waiting for some new emojis but there aren't any yet as you know in 13.2 and iOS thirteen point two or 12 point two that's when the emojis came out so there are no new emojis yet but we should see them probably at the end of September or the beginning of October when I was thirteen point two will be in beta announced messages is still not in the settings there it's still missing here but that should hopefully come back now a little bit of bugs so the carplay is still buggy and has issues and the phone notification here if someone gives you a missed call you still go check it and it still stays there until you reboot your phone and I've had that but since I updated I rebooted my phone and therefore it's not there anymore now performance and battery life performance is extremely fast it seems to be the same though as in beta 2 but it's too early to say battery life is good as well it seems to be good but I mean I don't really know yet because I've had it only for the past hour now the official release for iOS 13.1 will come out on Monday the 30th of September right here which is just a couple weeks from now and you should probably be seeing maybe one or two betas until then but that's unclear yet I was 13 point Joe has just been released the GM version is here so you can go get it it's here go ahead should you update yes if you've been having bugs or any issues whatsoever in cellular activity or in bugs or any other issues then go ahead and update your always update to see if it fixes some of your issues but if you're comfortable with beta 2 and don't feel the need to update then maybe it's better off that you wait a little longer for the final release or a future beta well this is the end of the video thank you very much for watching and please leave a like and subscribe and if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown in the corner up there to see what happened previously ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
