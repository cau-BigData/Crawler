what's up guys we finally have a date and time for the keynote or Apple burly's new software versions and possibly some hardware it's going to take place on Monday June 22nd at 10 a.m. Pacific time but I would want to really focus on the heavily rumored iMac that might be coming really soon further during WWDC it is going to be the first announcement of Apple's move to AR M processors starting with the iMac which Sonny Dixon has said a lot about over on Twitter every year when talking about new iMacs we always look at these gorgeous concepts but this year the concepts with slimmer bezels might actually become reality the new iMac is set to have an iPad pro like design which at first I was really confused because that was only supposed to happen on the iPhone 12 either way this is really exciting Sonny Dixon further says that the bezels will get slimmer maybe even to the point of the probe display now if you look at the pro display you can see how thin the bezels actually are then compared you to an iMac this will not be a gradual reduction in the bezels it's almost literally going to remove them on the inside we will have the t2 chip with an AMD navi GPU making it quite a significant upgrade to the iMac further it seems like the fusion drives are going to be a thing of the past and be fully replaced by SSDs even though Sony's track record isn't perfect these are things that we have heard already from many other places so I am really believing in these rumors because even leakers like John Prosser and love to dream have reported on the iMac Oh about the pricing well we have absolutely no idea what I'm hoping for though is that these changes are not going to really affect the price and increase it too drastically so all the pieces really seem to be fitting in hopefully if they did then in about one week Apple will reveal a new iMac of course that is not going to be the only thing during WWDC it is mainly for Apple's software including iOS Mac OS watch OS and all the other but that is still not it for WWDC we have a new report from mark Germann talking about apple's transition to a RM so why are we talking about this well Apple has been using Intel processors for over 10 years and now they are switching to their own more powerful ones for example on the iPhone these Arab chips are already present in the form of a 12 a 13 a 14 etcetera so you will have that same thing on the iMac too we are hearing that Apple will announce their switch during WWDC in about one week of course the upcoming iMac will not have a new a RM chip Apple will just be announcing this the earliest we will get a Mac with a RM chips is probably 2021 or later well what do you think which part of WWDC are you most excited about please let me know in the comments down below if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you
