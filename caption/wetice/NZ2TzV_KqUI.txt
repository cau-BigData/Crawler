hello everyone and welcome back to another video in front of me that I'm not showing you yet is an amazing phone my one of my favorite iPhones you probably know from the title which one this is but as a sneak peek here as you can see this is the iPhone or opening today this is pretty much the generation where they stopped writing that it's iPhone 7 or 6 or whatever if you remember previously it'll be written 6s so that's from both sides but this is the iPhone 7 from the picture here as you can see so this one is black as you can see from the picture really like black phones so pretty cool thing here now let's open this bad boy so as you can see from this point on they also started implementing small different plastic so you can open it up easily whereas in the past you'd have to go and cut through it so as you can see the plastic slides out pretty easily now here it is the box without the plastic looks a lot better yeah cool now let's put this thingy down and do a slide open so here it is they also moved the paperwork which is something that I noticed now since I opened the iPhone 6s in the past the paperwork was usually under this is a cool experience so remove the paper and the phone is right on top instead of the other way around here we go so this if I have not already said is my favorite generation of phones the iPhone 7 I don't know I've just been super happy with the iPhone 7s in general so that's why it's my favorite generation generation I know how announced here we go let's try to remove this gorgeous plastic that's also no I can see that go away here we go iPhone 7 or right here so as you can see this phone as the iPhone 6 is still quite the phone in 2019 even though 2019 is all about the iPhone XS I'm in 2018 but as you can see not bad and let's a little bit smaller than the iPhone XS except the fact that it's not an edge to edge screen which you have to keep in mind but it's still the most beautiful phone I've ever seen as always honestly you should not be surprised anymore alright so here we've got our little paperwork with all our stickers and stuff that's cool to keep and then we've got our this changed a lot as well since the implementation of the dongle which everyone seems to hate but you've got the power brick then you've got your new headphones earphones earphones no clue how to say it actually these headphones are lightning port headphones meaning that you can plug them in to the phone which has no headphone jack that's the main reason for this now here we've got our standard cable the dongle where's the dongle actually am I missing something this one doesn't have a headphone jack and they don't provide a dongle yeah it doesn't seem like this comes with a dongle are they making users actually buy dongles now like I've heard about that in the iPhone X S series or whatever and I didn't really see this happen for myself yet so ok that's not satisfying I thought I'd get a free dongle no but here we go this is our classical unboxing it was we break this cable lightning port cable this earphones which I don't know not very good quality and then you've got your paperwork here and you're gorgeous iPhone this is it here love this phone really beautiful love it if you enjoyed this video then you know what to do please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and I'm gonna see you in the next video it's not gonna be an odd iPhone unboxing anymore I think okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
