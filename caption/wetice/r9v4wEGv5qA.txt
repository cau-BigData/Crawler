hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today how are you let me know in the comment section down below now today I'm blending with the background so if you can't see me then me how could my face not blue so yeah you see me my face is on blue anyway today I'm going to talk about things to do on a plane so many of us travel by plane so I'm gonna tell you some my things that I do on the plane whenever I go somewhere so these are quite effective but you come up with your own eventually it just takes time when you're on the plane when you're stuck on it you'll come up with whatever that may not entertain you when you're off the plane but to entertain you on the plane so number one as you know many of us get on planes and you have these magazines in like the pocket in front of you I like to just scroll through them no matter what I just I just read through them and just choose something on every page that you would buy but you'll not buy and then that will take quite a lot of time from your flight time trust me if you get into it you will get interested even without forcing you to get interested so that's gonna be perfect and you're gonna read the in-flight magazine now the second one probably you have a phone or a Kindle or a book right you can read the book on all of these devices just download the book on the iPhone or the Kindle or you just take a normal book that's printed out there you go you can print it out you cannot print it up you have your book printed on on the hardcover book so there you go you travel with it and you can read the book I read the one entire book in a flight in my phone so and let's entertain me actually we took off I read the in-flight magazine and the book and we were landing that's that's how it works I mean yeah I don't read many books when I'm not in a plane but on a plane I just enjoy reading books number three this entertains you but may cost you some money eat yeah sometimes you serve you they serve food on planes for free but sometimes you have to buy it so just buy it if you have the money and eat the food slowly yeah slowly look out the window or look at the other people and it'll think up some of your time and yeah enjoy food it tastes differently in the air now another thing if you have your laptop or your phone you can watch a movie so download the movie before boarding your flight and you can watch your movie in flight so that way that's gonna take up maybe one hour one and a half hour to two hours of your flight time and you'll be happy and sometimes if your flight is short then that may be the entire flight and then the last resort if you really have nothing else to do like nothing like you're completely bored is you did all four before number five this one is last resort really sleep now some of us like to just get on planes and sleep like I know some people that just get on planes they get seated they're nice and comfy and they fall asleep before the plane takes off now I really congratulate these people because I cannot fall asleep before getting bored yeah so I don't like sleeping in any kind of transport but whenever I have nothing else to do I just kind of fall asleep there we go and yeah these are my five that I most commonly do on a plane I hope you enjoyed please leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this and like others and take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
