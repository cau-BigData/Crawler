[Music] as you can see I'm back this is a vlog today as you can see it's kind of starting to be dark out so this vlog is starting a lot later than I expected it to because I've been messing with the microphone and trying to make it work with my computer now something came in the mail today what I really want to show you guys and just kind of like I will make a different video later but I got SD cards and before I leave for dinner today I would just want to talk about these where are they so as the cards are very important to me because I have I have a lot of them because I go through them very quickly even though I should not but I break them easily and I don't know what is happening but these two came these are 64 gigabyte 95 megabits per second SD card and these two are I have no idea honestly I have no idea so but all of them are SanDisk so this isn't like an Amazon packaging I have no idea what's inside of it but I'm expecting it to be able T cards now I really hope that I've not been boring you with this small tech review I don't know maybe I hope not but I've been changing my vlogging style since and I just wanted to just you know just put multiple things in a vlog and not make it three minutes long but anyway I'm gonna go take a shower right now and I'm going to go and we're gonna go for dinner even though it's like 5:00 p.m. I'm just gonna go take my shower [Music] I always look kind of stupid after shower so I'm gonna make this short I just realized I have to make a reservation to the restaurant but I'll just do that then we're leaving after that restaurant booked time to leave we're leavin finally for a great steak [Music] and while it's freezing cold out and it's even raining so what a great idea to go for dinner today but right now we're waiting for the uber oh I'm getting wet already but he should be here in like seven minutes [Music] so we just arrived we're going to go find the steak house that's around here and we're going to go get the great steak [Music] and we're arrived we sat down we got the menu and I'm going to get a t-bone steak and I'm gonna share right after we finish eating how this one but this is a great restaurant [Music] that horse that's right in front of me is quite fascinating if you look here behind me this is the whole Walker with the meat so it's quite anything [Music] so actually with the last clip you may have been confused because actually it was not a team boat but it was a rebuy and we just ordered the last minute so actually other clip was completely irrelevant but finally eaten I'm happy and after great steak we're out so excited to be able to have this kind of great steak and now we're going to go back into the rain and get our drug and go back home it's actually raining quite a lot close and you really believe that it's only the beginning of November well it's kind of the middle of November but Christmas decorations seriously [Music] and the great evening over by coming back home and this is where it's going to be so if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it will be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you
