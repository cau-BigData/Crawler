hello everyone and welcome back to another video so today's another great day to talk about some air pods so these are two years old now and I'm waiting for the newer lease so this is my wish list now these are great but they're not perfect as I said in my review now the wish list starts one new design it'll be great to have some tweaks changes on this maybe even some colors even though I'm not complaining about the white but maybe they could add like a Space Gray or something like that would be really cool and water resistance so that has been actually leaked which is something that hopefully will come with the air pods because it's just kind of frightening since they're so small you have them in your pockets boom you jump into the pool and in your airports are gone and that's $159 gone that's not very good right number two better sound quality or noise cancellation so you know that these air pods don't really have noise cancellation so you hear a lot of your surroundings so you have to like pump up the volume which is not healthy but that's a struggle now the sound quality is not perfect as well as I explained in my review they're good headphones but not perfect and the sound quality could be improved that's always good to have a better sound three better controls so we have no controls over the air pods if they're in your ears you cannot like I don't know do some kind of you can only call series so you can tell Siri to lower the volume but that's kind of awkward in public to talk to Siri to lower your volume so you just end up using your watch or your phone or just it's kind of annoying I honestly for the price they could have done something like you could like you know swipe down or up to to lower the volume it'll be really great number four battery life so I'm not complaining about the battery life it's great amazing it lasts a week for me or more depends of the usage they could release new airports with a little bit more battery so they last even longer so then you don't have to worry about them every week and wireless charging would be really nice to have that's something I really hope that will come so you know that Apple has been developing the air power but they're struggling with overheating and it's nowhere near to come out so that's for those who don't know what their power is it's a device that can charge three devices at once your air products your iPhone and your Apple watch which is something amazing but maybe they could just come out with wireless charging case like that you can buy third-party wireless chargers and just charge your things so it doesn't be really good to have if they don't come out with the air power now also it was leaked in May I believe that you could charge your air pogs using your phone so like you use the battery from your phone to just place it on top then it will charge your air pods which I find kind of dumb because like you want your phone to last long and my phone doesn't take me through today so while they like charge my ear pods so to be just great to just have like a wireless charger that you can like carry around like the Mophie you know like the wireless charger from oaf you just place it on top and then you charge on the go which is something cool so anyway I'm not complaining about the air pause this is just my wish list I hope some of these four points will come true in the future and that the air pods will come out soon not too late because they're only two years old and they're all scratched damaged but they lasted for the whole two years which is impressive so the design is quite solid they fell multiple times there's semi watch resistant but like net what you're never entered into the charging port so I guess fine but let's hope for the best let's hope for them to come soon maybe by the end of the year or later but take care if you enjoyed leave a like and subscribe it would be greatly appreciated and if you want to continue these videos hit both of them and I'll talk to you later bye
