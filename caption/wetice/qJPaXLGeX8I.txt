hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released I was thirteen point four point five beta one to the registered developers one week after the public release of thirteen point four we are going to take a look at the changes the bugs performance and battery life before we start why did Apple jump all the way from thirteen point four to thirteen point four point five probably because all updates until thirteen point four point four are tested internally by Apple and should be coming out over the course of April and May as public releases to fix many bugs to the rise so let's start with the update sighs the update came in at about 4.1 gigabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max of course this will vary depending from which version you're coming from as well as which device you have but generally 4.1 gigabytes is because we're going from a public release profile to a developer profile so if we head over to settings and the general and About section we can see that we're running 17 f50 3 4 C so this is a long build number when the C at the end meaning that we have quite a few betas ahead of us if we scroll a little lower we can see that we're running 1.0 6.00 as the modem firmware which went from 1.0 528 in 13.4 if you had any connectivity issues that should definitely help and should fix most of them for you now let's take a look at what's new so the first thing that's new is in the Apple music app so you can now share music on your Instagram story so basically what you do you click here you click share and then you can go to you locate Instagram right over here it's gonna create the story and then goes directly to whatsapp and you can post this on your story which is a great feature there is also a fix in the settings for 3g touch options so if you 3d touch you have all these options show up and when you click on Bluetooth it opens up now but in 13.4 there was a bug where when you selected bluetooth it'll crash the Settings app or would not open Bluetooth at all and just get you to this menu further there were some issues on 13.4 as well regarding bluetooth on the iPhone and the iPad so this should definitely be fixed here but we won't know until some further testing another bug was with the VPN so basically the bug would not allow for the VPN to fully encrypt all the data leaving your device so this is a very big problem and hopefully it's gonna be fixed in this beta of course I didn't manage to see all the bugs yet it's stewar ly to say so in beta 2 we'll definitely have a much clearer picture and I'll be able to tell you more about the bugs I found in beta 1 what about performance and battery life the performance seems to be identical to 13.4 but otherwise there's nothing really different it's smooth there's no lag the animations everything works well I have no problems so until now there is no difference but when I'll use it for a few days I'll definitely be able to say more now regarding the battery life the battery life also seems to be quite good for the moment there is no battery draining or anything like that so it should be about the same as on 13.4 but after using it for a few days I will definitely know more if the battery life is doing something that it shouldn't do now should you update to thirteen point four point five there is no reason why you shouldn't update everything seems to be fine however be careful not to update on your main device until we know more about this beta of course this is a point beta in the thirteen point four so there will not be anything really bad going on and even if there is then it will be fixed next week with beta 2 so if you had any issues with thirteen point four then definitely go ahead and update it will most likely fix all the issues you've had but until then maybe wait for the public beta or wait for a few more betas from now and then update when the version is more stable well this is the end of the video if you enjoy then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up there okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you
