hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released I was thirteen point one the final release just a couple of days after the release of the new iPhones I was thirteen point one was supposed to be the full version of iowa's 13 but at the time I was 13 got released and it's really buggy there is really some issues so thirteen point one is going to be the full version Apple was most likely rushed to the new phone so they didn't really get time to take care of I was 13 now we got many new features but there were still many bugs if you're in beta then you'll have to reboot your phone so that you can get iOS 13.1 loaded in your software update section the update size will vary depending on the device and the update you are on so that will really vary now let's talk about the battery life performance and the new features as you know I've had I was 13.1 for the past few weeks on my phone access on my daily driver so now let's go take a look the first thing that I noticed is the volume HUD right over here as you can see there's little thing there if you'd be connected to your home pod or whatever this symbol here would be changing as you would go the three-finger gesture doesn't work on the home screens it works only in apps where you can actually put actually make a note or some kind of text edit so as you can see the three finger gesture works right over here however it doesn't work any in any games or anything like that so it shouldn't cause trouble you can also share your ETA from the map once again it's working again so it's a really easy another thing is in the shortcuts app if you use that often here as you can see the automation tab is back now where it was missing in iOS 13 point oh also airdrop is a little bit different so if you want to share an airdrop you would basically have your device's so like my iMac right here and all the other devices you could airdrop to also the Apple TV icon has changed it's white now instead of being a blue in the past so that's a little bit of a change here and there are also many little changes across the board which are gonna discover by yourself where you're gonna really play around with new software now the performance there is a big improvement in iOS 13.1 compared to 13-point oh and that's because there are less bugs than before but there are still some the animations are smooth there's no lag no stutter nothing really that's bad everything is working really good and it's a very big reason to update now some bug's the location privacy bug has been fixed where basically if it would ask you if you want to share your location if you click never it'll just select ask next time instead of actually selecting never carplay is working a lot better and there was also a bug with the lockscreen where you could pretty much access someone's phone through bugging through the lockscreen which isn't a really good thing you are also getting the added security as these bugs have been patched so it's a very good reason to update as well now battery life has been really good as well in 13.1 throughout I am really happy how the battery life turned out as you can see I was not using my phone to too much but as you can see the battery life was still tremendously good there are also reports of battery life drainage in Iowa's thirteen point O so that's another good reason to update to thirteen point one now should you update well if you've watched this entire video then you might see that you should update it's a very good reason all of these are very good reasons to update you will benefit so much from this well this is the end of the video I'd love to know what you think about thirteen point one if you got it if you didn't then go get it and let me know what you think in the comments down below also please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these it's greatly appreciated and if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown in the corner up there okay take care and I'll see you in my next one bye you
