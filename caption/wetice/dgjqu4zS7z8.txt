yo guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog as you know in the previous video I were in Vienna and I love with this awesome baby here as you can see I'm trying to make something cool out of it I'm trying to use multi camera thingy thing imma do liquor here I really like the concept of it and it makes something cool that you can hear the two cameras in work now this video this week's video well i'm posting two videos a week I'm gonna get to my normal schedule that I'm going to explain i have a ton of announcement and ton of speaking it i want to do in in another video but i cannot do all this in one but the main thing is today in this video I would really want to show what I do and what I what kind of camera equipment I use to make these vlogs I've been using the 100 be forever like I mean for a year I had it now I've been recording the trypsin journey since last April or so but I got the camera like Christmas last year so it's pretty much one year now before I just start gambling up again just so much I'm gonna say that I don't use many things and become a blogger you don't need many things to start you just need a 100 d and that's all seriously now what I we're gonna do is of course you know that when you have a camera with the 100 d I had this lens alright this is a lens that basically it's an 18 to 55 millimetres EFS lens so it's it's a good one and this lens came with the camera when i bought it so it's not the best one but on the camera currently on this camera here i have if it would focus done a little bit as you can see it's a canon lens EFS 10 to 18 millimeters of course it's not the best thing ever it's just like a super wide lens where I could vlog wherever I went with like a cool angle so that was like the main point of it but as you know that for this video I'm using it but I don't even know why but I really like the lens because it focuses extremely quickly not as fast as this one on the g7x this is literally amazing now the 100 d comes the roadie microphone it doesn't come with you have to buy extra of course but that's a nose awesome microphone except requires back these batteries are basically 9-volt battery well that you need for your microphone and they say that they survive about 100 hours or so but I don't think that's true really it's not true since I can record like 50 or 60 hours on it you know I did not count everybody does not 100 hours since i can compare my vlogs now the next thing you need is of course somewhere to charge your main batteries in the camera right the g7x i charged with this canon charger that comes obviously with the camera when you buy it in the box and that thing charge is pretty good and it's awesome and that's all you need i did not need another charger because if you know i have the dual charger for the canon 100 d i'm gonna show you this shortly but i need just one because I what I saw the battery life on the canon g7x is amazing it survives for a very long time I just went with Vienna the whole day on that one batch yet I had like 200 shots of something so it was it was amazing how it survived since you know that with the 100 d the battery life is like one battery for a cup like 20 minutes or something it's it's a horrible now that leads us to a charger for this camera for the 100 d this is the normal charger and obviously i had to buy back with and if you know i bought i have like nine batteries these two in a battery pack and then i have a couple more in charge so these batteries go extremely quick they go extremely click with with all this and and I don't know why but i don't it doesn't really matter but the next thing that's essential for you is a SD card because that's where all of your footage is going to be stored obviously right that's what it's gonna be stored now I have this kind of good little thingy it's it's amazing where you can store all of your SD cards now you know I have 20 cars in the cameras right now since the recording and the others and they're kind of all over the place but this is kind of like a pretty cool box where basically you can have all of your SD card stored on one spot and and you don't lose them because otherwise you have them all over the place and and it's just not very very good right so this is where store all of mine and I have 11 SD card what is a very good SD card it's a 128 gigabyte sandisk card it's a really good card it stores a massive amount of stuff since when I shoot many shots basically it fills up extremely quickly so that's why I really like that one but of course I have multiple 32 gigabytes one what just fulfill a job for just making this kind of small vlog over here then obviously as I said I had a dual charger for my 100 d we're basically I can charge two batteries at one so this very good and it has two ports it has one two buckle a trustee then there's a car charger uh and and then I can charge even through USB so that's really good i can charge it multiple ways through a computer in a car and everywhere so this is a very good thing and it has even an option of charge charging extremely quickly and that's why I really like this ones because before I had just one and two charged all nine matches to just depend in the butt to charge them every evening so it was basically annoying now of course to make a vlog essentially you need somewhere to listen it and you don't want to be playing it in public or something so I have just this kind of small that I use just to to listen to it whenever I'm i'm outside or something if it's if it's recorded correctly I don't want to figure that out once i'm editing it so this is pretty much essentially what you need and then I'm not gonna forget you need a gorillapod hold on you don't really need it it's not like a must because as you can see now I'm holding the camera in my hand just normally you see just the camera like this nothing really special and it works but if you want that it's easier for you i would recommend one of these gorillas pods these gorillas pods are amazing they do a great job you see you can put it down here just have it over here and that's where my camera was sitting right now it's super stable you can fold it in many different ways so it is a very it's very good basically now that's why i really like to use it because you can carry the camera around except of course it takes more space and when you have the g7x you try to go that you have the smallest camera the comp of compact camera but if you add this gorilla pod to it then it's not that compact right but that doesn't really matter if you vlogging quite often you just carry the camera around there's not a very big problem it doesn't matter if you carry it around because the gorillapod you can fold it you can put it in a pocket so it's not that a big deal to carry around and then of course all you need a laptop or computer home computer to edit your vlogs and the evening whenever you finish vlogging so as you know i use the asus zenbook i7 it's a perfect since you know some of you know I've been gaming before it was my gaming computer and now I uses as purely as an editing computer whenever I travel so if you're kind of like you travel a lot and you go to places i would recommend a laptop because with the home computer you would have to only edit at home what is not very practical now in your laptop i would recommend an SD card reader because that always helps a lot since if you plug like the SD card to your computer it transfers the data extremely quickly a lot faster than if you will be exporting it through a cable and that's why i really like to put the SD card into my computer directly and then i can edit through it because i never kind of like i always put it on my computer but i usually render out of the the SD card I don't know if that's good or bad I don't know but I do that because it's easier for me now we might as well finish the vlog over on the g7x basically it came out pretty good this vlog I'm gonna do an update probably because for Christmas I've got some things that I really want to share with you if it's something quite I'm gonna keep it then Christmases like 10 days in 10 days right now
