hello everyone welcome back to another video today's an exciting day because we've got some Apple earpods - rumors that came out just recently and it's gonna be interesting to talk about them and I'm really excited for the new generation of the air pods there have been many leaks stating that the Apple earpods 2 will come out early next year so early 2019 so it's a really soon and there have been many leaks which say that they should come out before Christmas that would be smart from Apple because many people want to buy the airport as Christmas presents so that would be great to release them now in the next coming weeks but there are some conflicting rumors about this what I heard so far there are many exciting changes and features coming to the airport's - and it's gonna be a slight refresh nothing really brutal changing no design changes or anything like that just like some good features to have that are missing now so what's gonna be new well everything kind of goes off the new Bluetooth which will be the Bluetooth 5.0 and if you don't know the bluetooth that's currently in the air pods is the Bluetooth 4.2 which is not bad at all except the upgraded 5.0 bluetooth will be way better and we'll be able to do many more things than just being bluetooth 5 for now the first thing that this allows is greater quality music so Apple music would have to do something with their big trade of streaming of music so that they could take advantage of this new bill 25.0 but that is fully possible and I believe that they're gonna do that to make the music better it's going to have a greater range which will be very interesting for people who want to listen to music in the gym for example if you want to leave your phone in the locker room or even if you're just at home and you want to leave your phone in one and listen in the other and that's gonna be way better now than ever before so the Bluetooth 5.0 allows 800 feet between the air pods and the phone whereas the Bluetooth 4.2 allowed only 200 feet so that's a four times difference which is amazing if you want to listen in greater ranges however these 800 feet are in optimal conditions which mean that they are in a super flat area with no walls with nothing so in your apartment or in your house that may be a little bit less since you have walls and some obstructions the Bluetooth 5.0 allows you to have less latency between the air pods and the phone so you may notice that when you click play on your phone it takes a little while to get to the airports now it's not very noticeable it's very quick but it's gonna be even quicker now so the latency now was 90 milliseconds and it's gonna go all the way down to like 40 or 50 milliseconds which will be even faster to play your music and there will be a lot less lag between the two devices now another thing that may come is the multiple air pods streaming which should be amazing to have because that way to friends for example and you could have air pods and pair them for the same phone and listen to the same music or it's the same movie so if you're hanging out with your friends and you want to watch a movie from your phone all of you can pair your air pods and listen to the same thing from one device that would be really amazing to see but that's not sure one disclaimer here the only way you can get the Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities is if you have a new Apple device and with what I mean is either a new MacBook a new iPhone a new iPad or something like that so they cannot be really older because they'll have only a four point two Bluetooth capability so if you want a 5.0 you have to really get the newer device but still 4.2 is a really good Bluetooth and does many things now you know about the W chip that's in the air pods which allow for a quick connection with your phone and your air pods which is super Swift and like you don't even know that it's connecting it's just like super quick that will get upgraded from the W one which is the first generation 2w two or three and that's not known we don't know that yet but this new chip will allow for hey Siri capability which will actually allow you to change your music or do anything while you're running for example just say hey Siri change the music or just whatever like that turn up the volume and that's gonna help you not reach out for your phone or your Apple watch to change your song and and so on so these features will be a little bit different from the previous airports too and it'll be really good to test out but I don't know if it's gonna be worth the upgrade for like $129 or something like that so we'll see about that and maybe the price will get lower since Apple actually want to sell these airports and actually going into the business of headphones so let me know what you think about this and if you would buy these air pods and if you would upgrade I would really want to know because that's something I might consider as well and I just want to see a reaction from all of you okay this is it if you enjoyed leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this it'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time bye [Music]
