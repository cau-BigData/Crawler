hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12 point for developer beta 5 to all the registered developers this was at the same time that Iowa's 13 public beta came out we are going to take a look at what is new and when we can expect the final release of iOS 12 point four so first of all the update came at about 213 megabytes on my iPhone 7 plus coming from beta 4 and all the previous betas now if we go into settings general About section click over here we can see that we are running 16 G 5 0 5 6 D we are on twelve point four that's the build number and the D here says that there could be another beta coming later but it is unclear maybe or maybe not besides this there isn't anything else that is very new in this beta nothing else is new right over here everything seems to be the same I didn't find any new features there aren't any new visual changes or features like that everything feels fast and the performance is great and it is optimized that this is pretty much almost the final version of 12.4 and many things were fixed from beta 4 to beta 5 some people reported that there were some connectivity issues with Wi-Fi dropping I didn't notice any of those issues but if you've been having any this should be your fix in this beta now battery drain issues that we're in beta 3 have been fixed by beta 4 and beta 5 probably just kept them the same there isn't anything new except that this is getting ready for the Apple card coming later this summer or probably in like a month or so now beta 5 should keep everything the same in terms of performance and battery life as I said previously and I don't have any issues or anything else but this is for those who can only run I wish 12 or don't want to go to iOS 13 too early then you should update to this beta it's great or if you cannot get the developer beta then just wait for the public release which we're gonna tell co-locate when it will come so when should it come just like approximately well we should see iOS 12 for maybe next week the first week of July or the week after latest but that all depends if we'll be seeing another beta or not but it should be early July well this is it there isn't anything much in this update everything seems to be the same but I just wanted to share with you what is in this update if you enjoy then please leave a like and subscribe also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown in the right corner okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you [Music]
