so today I'm gonna test myself how well I know the European Union we're playing geoguessr obviously but you probably know that from the title anyway as I'm looking here the United States map is harder than the European Union that probably makes sense because it's bigger it's bigger if you mean the 27 countries are in the you and this is them to USA it's it's a lot smaller than the USA if you ever mean Europe as a whole Europe is ten million kilometers which is a little bit bigger than the USA alright so basically so basically the u.s. is bigger than the European Union but it's smaller a little bit smaller than Europe itself good to know right so we're gonna play the European Union map after this small introduction it's easy with an average score of 18,000 I think I'm gonna do well so they just play alright how do I know this where are we parking I'm have already lost like I don't know we're opinion Union this seems like French and the same time it is France it is friends but France is big so it would be nice to narrow it down thinking Paris so alright let's go to you Europe it's that simple France that simple Paris let's just go to Paris summer run the outer edges of Paris alright let's make a guess oh cool it was in Paris 4900 81 points really cool so we're doing wild we're doing well so far let's play next John alright ring road Yamaha ok cool we're middle of nowhere ok this seems like either Russian the rest tries not pi√±on so it's not so Poland but it's either Poland I think it is Poland because I is either Poland or Ukraine but I don't know if Ukraine is in the European Union or not so I'm gonna go in Poland and I'm gonna go with with the oh yeah SPL so it's Poland all right so it's time just gonna go in near Warsaw and we're gonna hope for the best then make a guess and we got 4385 boys in Krakow actually so cool okay let's play the next round and whoa where are we I think this rekts is in German or Austrian now is there like a link maybe go Turkey up oh it's Turkey I hope is not in Turkey no it's not in Turkey I was a turkey it's either in Germany or in Austria and both are in the European Union so da de okay so this is we are in Germany that's easy we're in Germany however I win Berlin I think we're gonna be in Berlin alright let's stop swimming and playing geoguessr with the Apple Mouse and it's a little bit of a pain in the ass Berlin alright make a guess oh no crap it was in Cologne okay oh if you say so 3,800 boys I'm happy anyway let's just go the next round hi hello good to see you nice beautiful place I don't know where you are though that's not a sign I thought it was a sign three point three meters this is getting me anywhere it's like Finland Sweden and the Scandinavian countries in in the European Union I think no I don't know is this maybe Hungary I'm not sure right now I think we're in Hungary but I'm gonna probably mess up then yeah Hungary I don't think this is in Budapest though it doesn't seem Hungarian but just go somewhere in the middle alright make a guess yeah I kind of thought so so it's the European Union is emerging something here so I could have put it in Sweden but at least 2400 points so I'm fine with that right let's play the next round hey stupid fly here but I have crap on my desk ah now it's under my nail get out of my house okay we're back honestly I have no clue where we are McDonald's KBC parking bunk and are we are we another Germany I'd be nice to like a dot de or something we're really cool should be like Charlock and just go to Austria just to try our luck alright I don't think it's gonna be near Vienna low but make a guess what did I get explore oh that's an even 10 and you just keep on going cool okay great Oh 3,000 points it was in Belgium was in Dutch okay okay say some you're smarter than me game this viewer summary 18700 71 points so I'm pretty sure that we were above average I think so but yeah maybe the mishap thing that was in Sweden and I thought it was in Sweden but no it was not yeah it was but by putting agree whatever anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it'll be greatly appreciated and if you want more leave a comment leave a like to whatever you want and let me know you want more alright take care I'll see you next time bye you
