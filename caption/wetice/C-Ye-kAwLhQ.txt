hey guys and welcome back to another video now today I'm going to answer question that probably every one of us asked if you watch vlogs so if you watch vlogs you asked probably how do you actually make your vlogs to to look like that to have those kind of shots to have that and that and that so today I'm going to answer that question but in a way that I do so basically how I vlog so it's not gonna be how someone else vlogs but probably they're gonna be very similar now step one in my vlogs is having a time lapse at the beginning with like the episode number that's what I have now the time lapse I usually take outside or the clouds or something that happens in the vlog so it's not something completely off or from another day or something unless it's really pretty and it fits the next step is me starting the vlog so either I start talking when the time lapse finishes outside or then I come inside or just kind of like that and then I finish talking and we go somewhere for example I will do this kind of dynamic motion movement to go for example I'll have the camera see me walking or just going downstairs or the car leaving or just something happening showing that we're moving or going somewhere or that something's happening and we're changing environment then when I vlog I usually hold the camera in my hand like this or I just put it down on a rock or a window or somewhere and then just walk over to it and start talking to it that's something I really like because I don't like the vlog that are just like talking talking talking talking walking walking talking talking so I don't like that I just like to switch things up a little bit if I can of course then I can also change environments like I kneel down to go lower to the camera or I kind of go higher or whatever something to change it up then I have these kind of parts in the vlog where I just sit down and talk to you for example in my room where I just sit and talk to you guys that's an example and that's usually at the beginning or at the end and then at the end I usually have just me saying goodbye and just talking to about what basically happens and ending the vlog if that makes sense then in middle you know that I don't like having talking talking talking I have like talking then what's happening movement kind of like the story evolving and then it kind of finishes at the end so that's pretty much what I try to do now one tip for all of you you have to be yourself employ you have to be yourself in your blogs and don't be someone else or don't try to be someone else set another way and also be creative try to do something that you find interesting and try to see if it works I don't know I you know you just do some crazy things like roll over to the camera or I don't know just try to use your creative mind that probably every one of us has and and do stuff like that alright guys this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video all right bye [Music]
