hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at Iowa's 13.2 developer beta 2 which was released to the register developers and the public beta there are so many new things including new emojis buzz just get into this video so the updates came in at about 450 megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max right over here and the first thing we have to go look at is the build number so if we jump into general about we're going to see right over here that the build number is 17 B 5 0 6 8 e so the e is a big jump from theta 1 now just by scrolling a little bit lower we're going to see right over here in the modem firmware that we're running one point zero two point zero eight and that's a jump from a one point zero two point zero four so this should help you with some connectivity issues if you've been having any now the first thing that we have to go look at is the mo G's because that's really new here and the main difference here is with interracial emojis so what we have to look at is this right over here so if we select an emoji where there's a couple we can actually customize it so let's say you are in an interracial relationship so that's like this one and just briefly you see a different colored person and another colored person or they can be the same color or a different color and that's literally what you can do right over here and then you can just tap on that and you will have the emoji so that's really really cool and you can do that with all of them right over here with all the couples so that's a really big step so right over here we can see that there are a bunch of more emojis right over here different ones there's waffles there's butter there's different emojis for many different kinds of things and many new accessibility emojis there's animal emojis as you can see the interracial emojis and just a bunch more things right over here one big thing is that Siri was recording most of the time what you were saying and then Apple was reviewing it so now what you can do is actually delete Siri and dictation history directly from Siri right over here so Syrian dictation history click that and you can delete Siri and dictation history another thing is that you can opt out to help improve Siri and dictation by going into privacy analytics and improvements and improve Syrian dictation so by default your opt-out but you can often if you want to help improve Siri now you know that a new feature was haptic touch in iOS 13 and so you can now directly delete from this menu so as you can see right over here up here you have delete pages now or delete whatever app you like to delete so it all works in all of them and there's no problem whatsoever before you'd have to hold and just hold and just hold and then they would start wiggling and then you could delete it but now all you have to do is just hold haptic touch and then delete directly now if you want to rearrange apps that's been renamed to edit homescreen so it's not rearrange apps anymore now in the TV app there's a change so if you purchased some movies or something you can quickly be able to add them as you can see there's a new Add button up there so in the past it was just the plus sign but now there's an actual add like add Fritton so that's a little change one thing that I'm super excited about is in the camera app so if you want to change the frame rate you can directly do that by tapping on top you can go 720p HD you can change the frame right here so that's really really cool now in the app switcher as you can see have multiple apps opened up and so when you delete one it does like more of a bounce then before as you can see it kind of did like a bounce so that's a really cool and really here now one more thing in the camera hab if you go into the portrait mode you can actually change the light so there's a new option here on top when tap that you can actually change the light of whatever scene you're doing and you can change the light of the subject as you can see there are so many changes here in this update it's really cool to see all of these coming together and some of these features have been waiting for for the past long long long time theta 2 is a little better compared to beta 1 the performance is great it seems to be great for now but I've only had this for the past hours so I cannot really say and the battery life is great I mean if we go into battery I just went for this to charge up as you can see I mean I've been running and about 100 I mean I don't use my phone a lot currently but like when I did I used to have all-day battery life now I pretty have pretty much have a couple days long battery on my iPhone 11 pro max when I don't use it a lot every day so yeah I mean it's great but one thing you have to keep in mind once you update so give these emojis your friends for example might not have these emojis so when you send these interracial emojis and these new accessibility emojis to some people they might not show up so these people would have to update as well for them to show up so for now should you update well I would say that you should hold off a little bit wait for a different beta or maybe wait for the final release of 13.2 so that you and your friends can actually start sending these emojis and other things like this so overall there isn't nothing really important and major that you have to update immediately so just hold off wait and then you can enjoy it with your friends and family well this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed she did then please leave a
