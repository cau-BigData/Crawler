hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today it's another great day to record a video because today it's Friday and today we are back with my favorite game called geoguessr so last Friday as you remember we did not do geoguessr but we did the reddit reaction so this week Joe gasser is back I'm excited so let's just get into it alright where could this be by the way we're in single-player normal mode because let's just get back into the offenses not play Joe kisser for a couple weeks now I think oh the only I think that but anyway let's concentrate on where in the world we are so um where can there be a clue where can we go this is probably going to be somewhere in Europe that's just my opinion I don't know maybe Europe not Europe that is a European vibe so I think I'm going to go with Europe but I have to figure out where in Europe it can be now maybe this side can okay so since it in English it maybe is not in Europe that's an American flag that I almost missed so oh yeah because the line in the middle is yellow but it's kind of faded so that's what I thought so we are somewhere in the USA but where could that be good question what is this well this will probably be a wild guess summer in the United States but like maybe maybe maybe over we're kind of in around mountains okay I'm just gonna go kind of like Wyoming something in that area just let's let's just make a guess honestly up make a guess Oh okay so alright well it was in Maine so well I guess we figured out it is in the USA but well Maine that's kind of further away but anyway 1100 points oh okay this looks this looks like a nice place no lines on the road so probably this will not in the United States I don't know this I'm completely confused is that the ocean or the co I'm just going to think that this is somewhere in Great Britain that's just going to be my guest restaurant nope I'm gonna go with Great Britain because of toilets it's an english-speaking countries so since did I blurt it okay I think Great Britain is the only place where they have yellow license plates so I'm just going to take that and guess that way I mean it could be Ireland though but where I mean I'm just gonna go it could be either Scott I'm yeah let's just go to Scotland like on the way what kind of see this is the North Sea I'm just gonna go with this is the is the Atlantic okay so I'm just gonna go on the Atlantic side so I'm just going to go like where am i okay Scott it's not um I'm gonna guess here here you're Gervin there we go I guess let's see if it's in German yeah fine 17,000 kilometers away Australia all right well I mean so Australia has yellow license plates that's something new okay um we're in the middle of nowhere here we're in middle of nowhere there's no signs there's no nothing but I have a feeling Australia I have a feeling Australia or a feel of Canada what is this no pass things on well thanks for that thanks for that sign nothing more helpful than a passing sign this is a farm a farm mm-hmm it's a farm good though I don't think so is a farm I need a sign I need some location maybe a fly that says nothing I imagined that farm to have like maybe a flag of the country they're in I can't create that but this is gonna be a while I know I'm feeling like us but then I'm feeling also like Australia somewhere in the middle of nowhere but that's just our Europe but Europe doesn't have yellow lines so that's gonna limit it to where though I'm just gonna go like in Western Australia let's just go there me guess oh this is probably going to be the worst ever round we done we have done because well it was not enough sure Leo's in the United States it wasn't it was in Minnesota okay okay this I feel Europe I feel a Europe vibe but maybe like Africa I don't know I don't know where this is though because this doesn't say anything there's some mountains here you know there's there's just nothing to really go off so I'm just gonna continue going down the road honestly and mob-run night and oh there's a sign there's a sign you know there's a sign something that I think's your oh okay okay so that limits it to sub pain or Italy but I think that's not Italian I think this is Spain or Portugal there's a what should be in Brazil or somewhere just watch it be in Brazil okay somewhere in Spain is my opinion there's no C so probably somewhere here just watch it be down there just just make it guess Argentina Argentina yeah Argentina yeah well this just didn't completely go we have 1237 points and it's the fifth round it's the fifth round and I'm like no I mean this is good I'm just gonna go with America I'm just gonna go with America I cannot even think anything else because I don't know I cannot I cannot go somewhere else because and what should be somewhere else this is just like oh my god no this is gonna be Oh car blurred license plate oh there's a sign there I'm pretty sure Oh sign right there was a sign here that said something what wait what okay let me just turn around isn't freakin Argentina I'm gonna be dead I'm going to go I'm going to go in Brazil right now my guest is Brazil but let me just look further but my guess is Brazil yeah I'm going to Brazil but we're in Brazil just in middle it can be worse right make a guess it was not it was it was in Brazil so that was correct but it was in state of mato grosso so at least that's something that we had correct so now as few our summary whoa okay yeah this is okay this is 4,200 points this is horrible anyway this will do it for this
