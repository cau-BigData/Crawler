I have an idea and that's usually meaning that I'm just going to screw up something completely so when I have ideas it's just terrible so I have an idea with this this is my idea I'm going to use I'm just going to customize these sunglasses these are the glasses that I use in France when I'm sailing so they're like scratched and everything so I don't really care about them and I'm going to spray-paint them customize them a little bit so here we go to customize them it's the first time I'm doing this so bear with me you will need a pair of sunglasses painters tape a knife to cut around the edges and the paint you want to color your glasses with after cleaning them thoroughly you're going to take the painters tape and stick the glass so that the color and the paint doesn't go on it after putting the tape on the glass you're going to take your razor and you're going to cut around it [Music] then you're going to remove the tape without removing the tape that's on the lens and then check for any spots that you missed and remove it from there as well then verify if all of the glass is covered and repeat the same step on the other side [Music] if you've missed some spots just go over and cover them up with some more tape when you sure that all of them are covered they should look something like this and make sure all of the other outside part is not covered so verify that closely now you're going to repeat the process on the other side of the glasses as well since you're going to be spraying both sides now you will want a sharper razor for because I had a very not sharp one so what you will want to do is now if you have a not a sharp razor put more tape over the places where the glass is still exposed once you are sure that you covered all of the lens be sure about that you choose the colors you want to paint with so in my case I'm going to do the black on the outside and now you spray paint them [Music] now you have to wait for them to dry after letting it dries you can see they're nice and black beautiful depends on what kind of you're gonna have the color so for me it's black and now what I'm going to do is take white paint so the same white spray paint and I'm going to try to make kind of dots like you can see here on the glasses so this is like my design but of course you can design it the way you want it [Music] once they are dry and be sure that they are dry you're going to start peeling off the the tape you put at the beginning so just try to take it off somehow it may be difficult but just take it off you also may need to clean the lenses a little bit but that's not a problem let's take the other one off and there you go so this is the front side of the glasses really nice I really like them now you're going to do the same thing on the back so as you can see also the lenses need a little bit of cleaning as well and here you go your custom a glasses sunglasses really nice really like them really cool I see Wow really like them just clean off the lenses that's something you have to do and then you can wear them and be really cool so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video ok bye [Music]
