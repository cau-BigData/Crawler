hey and welcome back to a brand new videos once fully energized right now because I didn't sink Jesus I've been sick for the past week or so so I I just been not able to record any videos and it really came up to me but I need to go record something so this video is going to be something different than you usually know because I'm going to speak about something that happened during that week yeah I was sick but I was working quite hard on improving the video now I'm going to say something that I'm sorry if I spawn to the microphone couple times now subscribe to just kind of learning them I know this microphone to some of you may be no because I've been playing game yourself and i've been using it up there but now i decided to kind of the camera sound is not so very good that i'm going to try to improve the sound using my microphone so the microphone is right here hello my phone and I try to keep you out of the screen that the vlog still looks like there we film and sound of the camera and it's nothing abrupt seeing it or something starting it so yeah that's what I tried to do and I want to speak about something real quick that I have a new computer and that from recording this now the south of the microphone the camera that's something else that you see in forever but I am a new computer so that means i really want to start doing more editing put more effort into the videos even though i put a lot of effort into them i will increase that i recently got a picture editing software kind of like photoshop not really kind of like a lower level that i can learn so i want to learn that also maybe make some some more interesting thumbnail their stuff that's going to be kind of cool and yeah that's the main idea what I have for now but I also change my setup also i'm going to do many videos that will not be what you're used to for example to remember how looking at doesn't 16-mile it yesterday evening when I was like building Michael Richardson today now so yeah and basically i was looking at 2016 and if i compare it to 2017 there's a big difference really I I noticed many many difference between the video apology even if I go way way back like the vlog number one for music show different growth really would I mean the page numbers of member one but still bad I know do you like it I like maybe like five video that was 2016 but you know in 2016 accent making these kind of videos only in September's it's been like maybe five months or so that I was making that I'm making these dog videos so that's pretty new for me in general and just I try my hardest to work these and then I see also many videos logs there some funds are out of focus no I want to like reel that to make the video good make them good quality and so on now also one other thing I'm going to say my schedule for video for sure have to be different because i post videos every like 3-4 days not consistently so I'm going to work on a schedule to kind of put them on the schedule the videos and then at least you guys know when to come watch the videos and so on and at least i'm going to know where to record and kind of make myself schedule so if you want to take this video and something in 2017 it's not a saying is the 12 of februari I mean it's kind of like a new year resolution that I can make you feel a thousand times better maybe not how many times but just work on them in general and make them better for you than and we're entertaining for sure and I have like a full list of video that really want to make and probably i'm going to make them i'm going to make one after this one offer for the week because you know is the work is really weak and yet so that that's my plan just work on the quality and you make everything find in and it'll work so yes it's perfect and also something romantic computer inhabited water splitting and it's kind of cool that I can basically be changing the profile for like performance wise is so I'm learning the new computer and I also want you to be may be patient for a little while then I see how this microphone sound and until I figure out the the best sounding for the microphone housing I don't know that the microphone sounds the best that's not what we're going to try to do to kind of suit the microphone and many things coming in the next week for example capture card and it's like a name for something to capture card then I have a then I have this kind of external sound card coming thing so that's going to be perfect for me for the microphone to maybe tweak the echo and all these kind of things so yeah I'm going to take it rambling here because i think i ramble for long enough and i think you've got the mind point what i'm going to do and yes so let's see unless were found on these things and color right but anyway guys take care and be like be greatly appreciated like leave a like please be great and subscribe for more videos like this and if you agree with me if you want me to do more more quality videos oh yeah take care and I'll see you in the next video [Music]
