hello everybody welcome to another video today is a great day we're in boxing something today which has been sitting on my unboxing station for the past month so I'm super excited to finally open it so what it is that we're unboxing today is actually the super eye but whatever number driving recorder so what this is is it's a dashcam pretty much that has night vision which you can do some pretty cool shots with night vision and stuff so it pretty much records really good quality even during night as well as during day this is a 1080p camera so this could potentially replace your GoPro if you want to film some adventures but it could also save you from car accidents and if you have to prove something you pay less I guess this is like the first time I have something from this brand so let's just open it what I see right off the bat is that I'm pretty sure it's going to be something similar to the size of the GoPro so that's going to be interesting to look at so it opens up I'm really excited to see what's inside so we have two boxes here I guess let's start with the bigger one to see what's inside so I mean I guess you have your standard you have your standard car charger which is impressive that they give such a length in cable Wow so just a nine volt charger with a USB what is this this is like the usb on your thing I can never remember the name along cable which is great we also have an Android just the cable USB just to charge it probably a very small one next up we have okay we have like the window mount which I did actually not even expect to have with it which is exciting news so you just put this on your window you just put this on your window and you're recording it's made for that now next stuff we have what is this this is going to be like your dashboard mount yeah that's what that I'm pretty sure it is just a standard dashboard mount and then I cannot see inside your manual I'm pretty sure this is going to be a manual yeah it's just that out and now I'm pretty sure we're going to reveal the camera which is going to be in this box if I can't open it yeah that's gonna be the camera I will be surprised that the camera would not be in the box so here it is we have it protected if we compare it to the GoPro these are like the two cameras so as you can see this is a lot bigger than the GoPro you can already like see just by side to side and just like this it's it's bigger like it's bigger than the GoPro the GoPro is like the size of the screen if you look closely you'll also find that you have like settings for day/night or likes I don't know what these settings are really for but I think you said like this by scrolling with the wheel the settings of day and night but one problem how do you turn it on okay there's there's an on this potentially has to be plugged in probably throughout the whole time I'm gonna check that I found a solution I'm just stealing the cable from the Google home mini to try to charge this thing hi okay it's okay loaded so alright please insert sd card so far the quality doesn't seem to be terrible like it's it's quite good just for a small thing like this so it's a full HD I need to find Anna's D card let's try to get the SD card okay we are back all data will be deleted yeah okay okay oh it's not the touchscreen that's the problem all right so here we are recording so it's charging I'll try to record a clip and just insert it into the video how do I record alright so I got the to record so I'm gonna start recording myself in the camera so I think it has quite problems with light levels but that may be because I'm on in the night setting no I'm one day let's go to night then all right we're in the day settings this is what it looks like so I'm showing you my desk right now I am not convinced with the footage though but just well you saw the footage I don't really know if it was good I will see that in the video editing but just like the first thoughts I'm not really happy so far with how the quality looks but of course this is not like a GoPro that's 500 dollars this is something for 50 dollars so I think it has potential I will try to see what it does and you saw it so let me know if the did was good bad or terrible anyway this will do it for the video if you enjoyed you should leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this I have to go clean up this mess now so take care I'll see you next time bye [Applause] [Music] [Music]
