hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at iOS twelve point three beta six it's just been released a couple days after beta five and we're gonna take a look at some of the changes in this beta but before we do please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated now let's get into this video so this update on my iphone XS is at about nineteen megabytes now let's go ahead and look at the build number which you can find in the About section by clicking on the software version and as you can see we have sixteen f51 five six a-and usually what a means is that we are nearing the end of these betas however we still have the feedback app right over here and meaning that it might not be the final beta however we have seen this app in the past in final releases so that's not something we should worry about there's almost nothing that has changed in this beta it's mostly bugs that were fixed now in Safari pretty much the bug that I've been talking about in the past is fixed there's nothing wrong with almost anything anymore all the websites load there's no crashing or whatsoever so pretty good there now the only thing we can pretty much talk about is battery life and the performance in iOS 12.3 and in most of these beta so beta 4 in beta 5 and the previous betas the battery life and the performance has been very good the performance and all the phone's is very good battery life is very stable in iOS 12.3 it has been really good I go to sleep with about thirty percent so I'm really happy about that and over the past 10 days as you can see nothing really changed everything is working very well and I'm very happy about it now let's take a look at the release date of twelve point three so iOS twelve point three should be released at the end of May at least that's what we thought however with two betas being released almost back-to-back within a couple of days I say that the final beta could be this one and now I believe that the final release could be next week or the week of the 20th now one thing that is going to be really interesting is that Apple usually releases betas right after the final release but this time if they release the final release at the end of next week or the week of the 20th then there's still a gap between the first beta of iOS 13 now iOS 13 will be released very soon so there's nothing to worry about it should be just in about three weeks or so so we should just wait for that however we should be seeing the final release of this beta in the coming weeks well this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed if you did please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and that's it for now okay take care and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music] you
