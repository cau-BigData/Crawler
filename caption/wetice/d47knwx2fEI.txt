hello guys and welcome back to another video how are you today I'm fine so today I'm going to kind of do the part two of the previous video what was lenses for photos so today I'm going to actually show you lenses for videos that I use that are really great that I would recommend well I mean that I would recommend they're going from like the cheapest to the most expensive one that I own so I think then to kind of give you about kind of lens is the best I mean these are the lenses I collected so I think these are good for my usage so let me show you so I'm going to start with the cheapest lens that I have that you can get with 100 d or whatever kind of camera that's for beginners so this is the 18 to 55 lens it this is it I showed it in the previous video it's not very good as you can see here so it has an aperture of 3.5 5.6 so again it's not the best like level 4 for example dark shooting or in the night or whatever but you can compensate with a camera that has a good ISO range but be careful this one is not full-frame so be careful about that when you're buying a camera because you cannot use that one if you have a full-frame camera so be careful with that one moving on I have another lens that I actually shot all Scotland on pretty much entirely and that is this lens the 10 to 18 aperture 4.5 to 5.6 it's a really small compact lens that's 10 to 18 so it's really ultra wide so it's a really good for all kinds of uses again the light level is not the best but it works for shooting of landscape which is what I love to do it works for great pictures of ultra wide so that is really amazing if you want to take pictures of I don't know some kind of mountain range or next to like capturing mountains and the like so you can really work with this kind of lens even though you have to should even though it's the best to shoot during the day because you have more light the 10 to 18 is not the cheapest lens but I think it's worth while to get it I really start to do that lens is a great vlogging lens to start it it really will help you out tremendously in all kinds of areas so yeah maybe save money for that now the most expensive lens that I own that I actually got just recently is this one alright so this is the 16 to 35 aperture for this is and I don't know it's like this lens is about $1000 something like that so this is a really great lens a really great lens if I should say but be careful it's full-frame so it's only for full frame cameras it doesn't have a great aperture but since you have a good camera with ISO that's full frame what's for example the 60 watts I probably yeah it's the top this is the first camera in the line of its the first camera from the top that's in the line of full-frame cameras so if you could buy a 60 that this video is shot on yeah take this lens I use it for vlogging 16 to 35 gives you a wide-angle and some zoom to some extent of course not the same as I don't know another kind of lens so I use it for vlogging it's really good for vlogging have the ultra wide and then you have some kind of zoom and if you really need to zoom into something even though it doesn't have the biggest zoom you still can work with it but it has a really good autofocus really good crisp quality really good lens for taking pictures again it's very similar to the 10 to 18 which I mean again they have very similar light levels except the this one 16 to 35 has a fix for aperture which makes it a 4 on every kind of setting you have there but the 10 to 18 is 4.5 and 10 and 18 on 18 it's 5.6 so the light level becomes terrible as you zoom in so I think this lens is also worth the wait even though it's bright it's like double the price of this one I think you should wait for this one and I would not recommend the because there's like the mark 2 and mark 3 I believe of this lens and I would not recommend you to get that one because what I was reading what I was reading and what people are recommend it's really not worth the money because after it it looks like I don't know five hundred dollars more expensive which is not really worth it even though then you get the two point something I don't have two point four I think and or to point out two point eight so you get the two point eight what's the mark to ending the one point four the back three but that's like crazy price so I mean just think about it and read for yourself but these these are the three lenses which I use so these are the three lenses this one's not full frame this one's not full frame as well and this is the only one that's full frame for video so I mean you know full frame are more expensive than not then not full frame it's really really I mean you really have to choose wisely but it's to do it for the video if you enjoyed which leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video all right bye [Music]
