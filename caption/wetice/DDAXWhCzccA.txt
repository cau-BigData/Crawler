hello guys welcome back to another video today we're going to talk about the chromecast 2 so if you remember I did an unboxing way back in August and since then I did not really do a review so this is kind of gonna be a couple months with this amazing device so the chromecast is this little small device here that connects to your TV via a HDMI cable which gives out sound and audio and even controls your TV so with this amazing device this is the Google home mini which is an amazing Buy and compared to this you can see how tiny the chromecast is and if you pair them up together you can just say a command like hey Google Play I don't know what on netflix or a new tube or you didn't even have to say that you like find it by yourself but the only thing you have to say is that like play it on chromecast but it's like super simple and it's super great and at the beginning I always have to turn the TV by myself on until I figured out a way to make this thing work so that it turns on your TV and turns it off with just the voice command on the Google home mini so the way I did that is setting on the TV which allows a HDMI port and the devices external to power and power off the TV so the command for that on the Google home any is just hey Google power on chromecast power off chromecast or whatever you call it so it works really well you can turn on your TV turn off your TV and play whatever you like so that's like the big thing that is super good about this thing another thing is that how compact this little thing is it's just impressive and how much functionality it has because you have so many different options on it you can play YouTube Netflix Amazon all kinds of streaming services as well as play music on Spotify or Deezer or in whatever you have it just does everything you like from your voice so whatever you say she's gonna do it and it's just a really good functionality now I believe that Amazon has something similar to this like the fire TV or something like that along those lines I'm not pretty sure but this Google thing is just amazing these two devices do everything for me on daily basis and I covered this this is the echo dot 3 you guys seem not to like the video because there's a quite a few dislikes now but I'm not like against that because that's just my personal opinion but if you want to buy something better it's the Google and this I don't know everyone has their own opinion and it's even smaller than like a big thing like this comparison anyway but I had an amazing time with this there are no problem with the chromecast whatsoever you can just like from YouTube there's like a button to cast so you can just directly cast and if this has control over your TV it'll just turn on the TV and get it ready so you can go to bed and watch it so it's like no problems this is the best thing ever and I recommend it so so so much to anyone who wants a super good streaming device that's very affordable buy this this cost like $40 something like that I don't remember but it is just the best thing and worth every single penny you have and it works best with this so like you can buy this just by itself and click the cast button from like Netflix or from YouTube or from any other device but if you want voice control you'll have to get this the Google home Mini or if you prefer the Google home hub or like the big thing and done it or something smaller is better for me so yeah fully recommended if you want to have something that can cast these two devices here are the best way to go this is all you need and you have an amazing setup with the chromecast and Google home mini but anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video okay bye [Music] you
