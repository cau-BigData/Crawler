hello everyone welcome back to another video in this video we have a lot to talk about we received some leaked dates for WWDC in June I was 13 rumours and more air pods to rumors but if you're excited and don't forget to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news let's get into this we have a new report stating that the air pods - iPad Mini 5 air power and more will be available for pre-order on the 21st of March and will be shipping on the 28th this would mean that we'll be seeing a March event probably just before these dates we have several sources claiming of the air pods - will be coming in the first half of 2019 specifically a March event held by Apple however there has been this one source that is saying that the air pods - should be coming in the fall so that's a massive delay but they also say that during the March event we should only be seeing the wireless charging case for the current air pods I don't know how I feel about all this as only one source is talking about it because I personally feel that these air pods should be coming in the March event as many many sources are talking about this and everyone's excited however we will have to wait to see who is actually correct from all of these we have another report from Mac rumors which says that they found the dates for WWDC which is super exciting to see WWDC is a show that Apple hosts every year to talk about their new software for iOS Mac OS TV OS and watch OS they are also known to release some products during this time as they did in 2017 last year I don't really remember if they released one but Mac rumors say that WWDC should be from the June 3rd through June 7th this is quite interesting to see quite a long time before the action event let me know if you'll be getting tickets for WWDC down in the comments below and let me know if you'll be even going with the dates for WWDC we can pretty much predict when the first beta of iOS 13 will be released it should be most likely on the 3rd of June and it will go out to all the developers we should be seeing a public beta soon after probably in the following weeks closer towards July it has also been a long time since an iMac refresh so we may see an iMac during that event which would be super cool to see for all those fans of the iMac for iOS 13 we already got many many leaks and we talked about a bunch of that in previous videos we know that dark mode is coming and a redesigned screen with an emphasis on high pads we should still be seeing a redesign for the iPhone but most of it it's going to be done for the iPads with all this in mind we can already tell that iOS 13 will be a lot bigger than iOS 12 there is a lot coming in the next few months and I'm super excited for it but anyway this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed then be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
