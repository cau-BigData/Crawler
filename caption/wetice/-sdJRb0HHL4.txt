hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're taking a look at this amazing fascinating phone this is the Huawei P 30 Pro today I'd like to share my one-week experience with this phone so starting off right from the screen the screen is amazing so it comes in a resolution of 1080 by 2340 if I remember correctly correct me if I'm wrong but it is impressive so the phone is little longer than your typical phone and a little like slim ish but that's great in your hand then if we continue on you can either use face ID your password or just touch ID right on the screen when we unlock the phone it's super quick you just put your thumb right over here and it unlocks your phone so just looking at the image and the resolution of the phone it is impressive like amazingly impressive there's gonna be more videos about videos and photography on this phone so stay tuned for those coming later this summer now moving on I installed pretty much all of my applications on this phone and start using it for about a couple of days just to test it out it's impressive so Instagram Twitter everything is so clear the text is so crisp the images are perfect you can even see the little details on the image it's truly impressive I already took some pictures on this phone you're gonna see more videos on that later but like look how it fills on the screen the screen is pretty much completely borderless like it's incredible how nice the screen is now in terms of battery life let's talk about Bachelet because that's like a subject that many of you want to know about battery life on this phone is not bad better than most phones right however it has pretty much half of the capacity of the huawei mate 20 X which we unboxed previously click this card if you want to see more the battery life here so if I go into the battery mode here I'm at 44% and it says I have about 27 hours remaining so plus mine is there up at about 50% we'd have like 30 plus hours so there would be 60 plus hours altogether with the phone fully charged the huawei mate 20x has about a hundred and 20 hours when it's fully charged and I'm not kidding 120 hours like straight like it's incredible so basically this phone has half the battery of that but 60 hours for a phone is pretty pretty incredible that's like two days plus if you use it a lot that's incredible that you don't have to charge it so battery life is incredible now performance I don't really see a difference between the may 20x and here it seems super fast super quick the internals are better of course but it just seems super fast as the May 20x just a little bit faster maybe but that's just probably what you feel and what you see so performance battery life awesome screen awesome camera incredible now I'm not gonna touch on this topic too much because there's more videos coming soon about that but I just can say that the camera portrait night mode time lapse anything is pretty dang impressive so let me just take a selfie maybe for you so you can kind of see that it is truly incredible image quality like impressive like you can really see every single detail of your face on this little thing it is impressive Wow anyway this is pretty much my one work review I love this phone so far so good we're gonna put it through few more tests and then I will give you my final verdict towards the end of the summer but if you enjoyed this video then you know what to do please leave a like and subscribe and if you missed out in my previous video then please click the card shown in the right corner up here okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
