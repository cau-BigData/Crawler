hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video oh my god today is a great day to record a video because today we are going to look at the airport again so today it's going to be the comprehensive review last time I had no clue how last time I had no clue how these work well now I do know how these work so we're going to review them it's been a week and I've been using them everyday so I think I know how they work so I managed to kind of figure out how to pair them to my phone and I'm gonna show you all that so for the making of this video I will use one piece of phone one piece of airport's charger two pieces of Apple earpods one piece of me if you checked all that that means we can begin so first of all I'm gonna start by showing you something that's really good is actually fight if you look at my phone that's my phone now if I open the air pods like this open them up on my phone there will be something that pops up as you can see there's a charging case and my Apple earpods battery in each of them so that tells me how much battery life there is and then it's just closed it off it's kind of disappear so that's perfect and I think that's good at least I can know how much battery there is now to bear it it's very simple so I'm just gonna like remove it from forget this device forget device what you need is your phone again and now you're going to just open this so it's gonna show you something else than not your air pods now you're gonna click connect it's gonna do a thing i'ma do occur where it's connecting and it tells me that it's connected so there we go I'm super excited and then I just put done it's pretty much done this tells me that they're my air pods so actually there's also like card that comes with the box where you can read all about it um so you can read about this but these are very simple so like the review part now I really love them the music sounds great it kind of leaves you some kind of space where you can hear your surroundings what's great if for example there's a car that's gonna run you over I don't know but it's good because they sound great they sound even better than the normal I would say to normal I have Apple kind of earphones that come with an iPhone or an iPad I think I don't know but they sound a lot better than that they're great they don't cut out I knew that there are some people who think that and say that they cut out and it's not a very good and reliable kind of Bluetooth connection but I did not experience that so I would say that this is great now battery life it's like amazing because I listen to music when I'm in the bus for like I don't know two hours a day three hours a day and that means that I actually don't use a lot of battery per day so I mean maybe three hours an over-exaggeration at least one to two hours yeah let's say like that and so far I'm at 50% of battery after a week so wow that's like amazing yeah that's about two hours of a day yeah that's that's fast I think of using only air pods so it's actually great battery life so for me it will last two weeks before I have to really charge it I mean if you really want you can charge it every night but I would not do that I'm too lazy to charge every night okay well this is it so my opinion you should buy this if you want Bluetooth headphones that are completely wireless without like a cables around your head I think you know because those exist I don't like that so they were candy from Apple so they connect your phone it's just great it's so simple and they connect it so simply so that's all anyway this do it for this video if you enjoyed usually like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it'll be greatly appreciate I know what happened in they droves video because I was like I don't know what happened okay whatever take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
