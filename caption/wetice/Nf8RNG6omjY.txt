hello everyone and welcome back to another video previously I unboxed the air Potts Pro and ever since I tried them on I was impressed of course Apple already released new air pause this year called the air pods - which only added an optional wireless charging case but nothing really else but a next hour of talk time which can be important for some but I didn't consider it as an upgrade and so I waited for these let's start with the most important and most obvious change and that's the in-ear piece this change benefitted the air pods in so many different ways you can't even imagine with the proper seal the sound quality is now seemingly better but that might not be entirely due to this it could be due to their updated speaker design and their h1 processor or just a little bit of both in any case they have fuller mids and more bass without being too overpowering like some earbuds on the market currently further these also seem to have better sound quality than the power beats Pro which just so conveniently went down to $200 so why are these so expensive three words active noise cancellation of course this is not new technology but Apple made it seem like it was their new invention for those that don't know active noise cancellation ANC basically uses an outward facing microphone to detect external sounds and then creates an equal but opposite sound which basically cancels out the noise this works well in environments where the noise is pretty much constant like a buzz or airplane noise however once the sound becomes irregular and not constant it has more trouble cancelling it out apple claims to have innovated on this technology by making the earbud listen to the noise in your ear canal to further improve the noise cancellation it listens up to 200 times a second and adjusts accordingly which is pretty damn incredible so are they really so good surprisingly yes the active noise cancellation starts as soon as you put them in even if they are not paired if you compare them to regular headphones on the market that cover your entire ear they could they would sound even better in my opinion another really big plus is the comfort some other earbuds have some ear attachments or just don't feel really natural and comfortable in your ears however since these are so lightweight and have shorter stems than the previous air pods it makes them very very comfortable they are just sitting perfectly in my ears and sometimes I even forget that they are there that's how comfortable they are the customization in settings is also awesome by applying pressure on them you can change a variety of different things and the biggest plus by far is that these are fully customizable now if you are looking at the pricing of the air pods - and the airport's pro you might notice a significant difference there is of course but the airport's pro are just worth the extra cost of course they have the same five to six hour battery life the same 19 hours in the charging case and another difference that you might notice is that the air pods Pro come with a bigger case but it will still fit in your pocket which adds to the portability of these earbuds these are pricier compared to some cheaper alternatives but they have great sound quality great comfort and great portability which are one of the most important variables when choosing the correct earbuds anyway I would recommend these a hundred percent as I am using them every day and even while editing this video well speaking of editing this is the end of the video because they have to go edit it and if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these wait wait wait don't go anywhere before you go please consider watching my previous video which will be shown in the upper right corner right over here now you can go okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
