hello everyone and welcome back to another video we have some very good news regarding Apple's March event as well as the products that should be launching within the next two months we might have a date for the March event the new iPhone assist 2 is coming the 20/20 iPad pro is said to be already in production and we will look at the new MacBook Pro 13-inch coming soon as well let's start by talking about Apple's supply some of you might know that I'm in Hong Kong and this entire area has been hit quite massively with the Nobel coronavirus since apples factories are mostly in China the supply might be affected due to their closure in a recent press release they said that iPhone and other product suppliers will be limited across the world and they might sell out a new article from Mac rumors said that the new generation of air pods should be in production and released in the second quarter of 2020 but due to the current situation in China they might not be coming as soon and they might be pushed back to later in 2020 also in this article they said that the air pods will be an entry-level version instead of a third generation however regarding the other details we have no other confirmed ones but we can still hope for black color and some better specs the rumored March event has some leaked dates usually Apple has the event around mid-march and this year it should be at about that same time one source is saying that they will hold the event in the last half of March on the last day the 31st many other sources are also saying that the event will happen especially with all the other products that are on the way there should be new iPhone se - the new iPad pro a new Apple TV a new MacBook Pro a new iMac the red apple watch and tile trackers and so much more we have been hearing a lot about the iPhone se 2 and the iPad pro 2020 and today they are said to be in production so we should still be seeing these two products in after the leaked March event this year however the new iPad pro won't have such a significant upgrade and it doesn't really make me personally want to buy it it will have a new 3d time-of-flight camera alongside its three cameras a faster processor but nothing major on the outside it will definitely not be a very big upgrade unless you really care about the three cameras further in 2020 Apple is rumored to be releasing a new 5g iPad pro with an a 14 processor so you can see that there will be two new models this year alone it should be available in March but the availability due to the current situation will be rather limited the iPhone se 2 will be shown during the March event and you should be able to get it the same week of the event it will be in the shell of the iPhone 8 with a faster processor potentially more battery life and so many other things for a very low price this one is definitely very interesting and a source is saying that you should be able to buy it as soon as the 3rd of April 2020 the price of the original iPhone se was about $400 $399 to be exact and a new source is saying that the price should be at about the same level of $400 so there is a lot of news about the upcoming products and I'm definitely super excited to see them let me know in the comments down below which product you are most excited for well this is where I'll end it off so if you enjoyed then please do leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these as well as don't forget to hit that little bell so that you're informed when I post my new video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you my next video [Music] you
