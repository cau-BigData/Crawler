hello guys welcome back to another video today iOS 12 point 1.3 has been released and it's super cool because it's just a month after iOS 12 point 1 point 2 so we have kind of a little bit to look at it's not such a big update as I thought it would be but there's still many issues fixed and you'll probably be very happy with it but let's talk about all things in this video let's start with the update size the update size is quite big just don't let it confuse you because since it comes there about 2 gigabytes for me some people say it can come at about 100 megabytes or so but depends on each phone I have no idea but the update is not massive feature wise it just fixes a crap ton of bugs so let's just talk about what's new a huge issue that has been addressed is the photos scrolling in the iMessage app what that means is that when you are scrolling and looking at pictures that are we're older it'll just reset and get back up so you would not be able to go look at the pictures that's just one update that's great and that's an issue that's fixed which I really had that issue and was really annoying there was an iPad bug as well which basically caused audio distortion but that was on the new iPad with the USBC connector and that you could connect it to an external speaker and that created some audio distortion windows plugged in which wasn't really pleasant but in this update that has been fixed one thing that I noticed when I connected my phone to a carplay is that it'll randomly just disconnect especially on the iPhones from 2018 which was just kind of annoying you're really listening to some of your favorite tunes and all of a sudden like goodbye that's a bike that I did not really notice too much but it was still there and that has been fixed as well home pods gotten updated as well because they were able to randomly shutdown or restart and sometimes Siri even stopped listening so you were not able to use the Hopa to its full capability but now it should be completely fixed well one thing that I had even in my comments on my previous video about the iPhone smart battery case release was whether or not you could use the iPhone excess battery case on your iPhone X iOS WAP 11.3 allows you to do that so if you have an iPhone X go ahead you can go and buy the iPhone excess battery case you'll be super happy with it it's gonna work it's compatible now many people complained about cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity with their phones whether it was range whether it was just the speed whether it was just the connection and failures and all that that has been fixed as well so normally you shouldn't have any more problems like that so it should be very happy about that and especially in the countries where this bug occurred where I live did not happen but there are many people complaining that connectivity issues where permanence on the phone there was this airplane mode bug that has been going around here I haven't noticed that bug but what I have noticed is the VPN bug which pretty much does the same thing well this means you are not even in airplane mode but your phone would show the airplane mode symbol as well as the VPN so that's something I have noticed but it's not been too much of a pain in the butt but it's fixed so that's pretty much everything that's new as you can see many bug fixes nothing really big feature wise but that we know since I was 12 was made to be a bug crashing update one thing that I have noticed while using I was open went on three for about a day now is that it feels faster than I was to a point one point two and the updates before I have noticed this since I was to open 1.3 beta 4 and now it's even better it's super fast it just feels way faster when you're closing apps or just doing something on your phone which is great battery life well the battery life was really bad on iOS 12 point one point two and throughout all this but I don't really know if it's better right now but a new update should bring new so maybe it's better maybe it's not but I may make a video on the battery test here to see if it's good or not so anyway should you update yes definitely update connectivity boost bug fixes that's what you get amazing things but let me know after you have updated how it feels and how you really like Iowa's slope 11.3 whether or not it brings some bugs with it as well because that's a possibility but normally many bugs should be crashed should not happen anyway we should be seeing and I was beta release maybe this week or so hopefully I'm excited for that but if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it's gonna be greatly appreciated by me and if you have any comments I'll reply to all of them as I love doing that anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video ok bye [Music] you
