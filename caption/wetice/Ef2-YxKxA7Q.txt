hello everyone and welcome back to another video today the long-awaited iOS 12.2 beta 4 has been released there are some new features and changes that I would like to share with you in this new beta but if you are excited for this video then leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more the update sighs wasn't that big at about 300 megabytes for my iPhone XS but it can be more or less depending on the version you're updating from so let's say you're going from beta 1 to beta 4 then it may differ for you however with this size you may tell yourself that's a big update there should be thousands of new features well actually not really but still there are some interesting features if you go into the control center and look at the Apple TV remote you will see that the icon has changed it looks more like a remote now however the remote menu stayed the same as previously updated in beta 3 continuing if you go to the Settings app and navigate over to podcasts you will see a new selection for going forward or going backwards 10 seconds or more this is something similar to how you can go forwards or backwards on a YouTube video now I would love to hear what you think about these changes in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more the news app was updated as well the ICANN got refreshed and looks better but it isn't a major change I also noticed a small change in the Apple music app where they now feature a three month trial right as you enter the app I know I know it is a small change but I wanted to share it with you anyway now as you know the battery life hasn't been that good in the past betas especially beta 3 but I think I know why the added some new features to the battery menu in the Settings app there is a new tab called usage under the insights menu which tells you what you can do to prolong the battery life these are all the features I found so far but I would love to hear from you if you found some new features that I missed in the comments down below the performance seems to be solid it is very smooth and doesn't feel like they did something with the performance the animations are smooth and there is no lag at all overall it feels pretty much the same however I would love to talk about the battery life but since I've had this beta for an hour now I really cannot say but stay tuned for a follow-up video about the battery life in this beta well that was I was - 0.2 beta 4 it lets me know what you think about it in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music]
