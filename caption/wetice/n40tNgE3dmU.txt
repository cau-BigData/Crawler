hello guys welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about the latest iPhone X I and Apple watch series 5 rumors and a little bit about the MacBook and Max rumors as well as some more on the air power and air pods - now if you're excited and leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more let's get into it today we've got a massive report from TF international securities about apples 2019 lineup of all their products this is a very well-respected source with actually a good track record and they're really trustworthy in my opinion let's talk about some of the latest news let's start with the 2019 iPhones so we should be seeing three new models there will be kind of a second generation of what we already see today so it's gonna be kind of a continuation nothing really changing except a few minor changes so we should be seeing something like the iPhone XS something like that can i phone XS max and a new iPhone X are at least one of these iPhones will have a triple lens camera which we can now pretty much say that third lens will be an ultra wide or a super wide lens to take amazing wide pictures let's look at all the new stuff from this report now there should be new bad tech for improved geolocation and navigation inside of a building so let's say the connectivity when you get out of the building will not be so kind of weird it's gonna work way better than before there will be a new back glass it'll be kind of more Madi it's gonna be a little bit nicer and actually probably coming to the airports as well we will have new charging technology which is going to be even better in 2019 there will be a new bilateral wireless charging which basically allows you to have a charging mat but your iPhone X there and then you can put air pods another phone on top and it's gonna charge through the first phone into the other phones you can potentially charge two phones at once which is super interesting to see of course face ID with the new processor is getting upgraded there will be a new flood illuminator which will get stronger and there will be less rejections when looking at the phone to unlock it and maybe even less misinterpretations however I haven't had any of those except of some rejections as with every iPhone we should be getting a little bump up in battery life so we may go a little bit higher as it'll be way better as my phone pretty much lasts one day ish now from this report I can say there are two or really weird things we should not be seeing a USBC based on this report we should keep the lightning port and the notches won't get smaller which kind of contradicts some of the other sources which say that the notch is getting smaller and also some supply is already kind of know and confirmed that the notch is getting smaller in production let's get into the Apple watch Series 5 which the Apple watch says this is my first one has been one of my favorite products it's amazing on a day-to-day basis so we never heard so early on about some Apple watch series 5 rumors of series 4 we never heard about them so early on ECG will be expanding to different countries around the world not just in the US there will be the ceramic casing around the Apple watch is gonna get upgraded and may even get more Madi as would be on the iPhones and on the air pods to the button that you have on the side will not be a mechanical button but more software based which means that it's just gonna give you feedback kind of like a vibration like you see on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 home button it's not mechanical you cannot really press it and it will reduce some of the issues where it can break or get stuck and it'll even make it more watertight than it already is let's get into the iPads so 2019 this report will be an amazing year for Apple they're supposed to release the iPad Mini with apparently a faster processor maybe going up to the a10 Bionic we should be seeing a ten point two inch budget iPad so going from nine point seven inches all the way to ten point two so some sources say 10 inches some sources say 10 point 2 inches so I would say the safest bet is around 10 inches bloomberg said in the past that we'll be seeing new iPad pros in the spring of 2020 however this source says that we should be seeing two new iPad pros this year so that would be a total of four iPads to come so as you can see here there are conflicting rumors about this some say that we should not be seeing iPad pros until 2020 and some say we should be seeing them in 2019 we should be seeing a spring or lease for the iPads the budget iPads at ten point two inches based on this report and an iPad Mini during the spring event as well so we can say they're on their way the details are not really precise yet so we may be seeing something completely different from this but still super amazing let's talk about the Mac's a little bit starting with the MacBook Pro there aren't a ton of details but if you want to get a MacBook Pro right now don't do it there's a new MacBook Pro on the way so just wait a tiny little bit longer for a new Mac Apple is preparing a huge refresh for the MacBook Pros with a 16 and the 16.5 inch model made for professionals they will be completely redesigned and well we can't really say the whole redesign because it's unsure yet but it's most likely going to eliminate the bezels around which will make a super cool screen and the 13-inch MacBook for all of those who want to get one will be able to go to 32 gigabytes of RAM the Mac Pro which was supposed to come in 2018 was delayed as you know and now it's supposed to be coming in 2020 so Apple wurly a 6k screen with that so a 6k dedicated screen probably with no bezels amazing to see so apparently or k5k wasn't enough for them they went all the way to 6k so what we can say I bought seven touch is coming with most likely a a10 fusion chip based on this Mac rumors tweet air power will be coming in 2019 alongside air pods to with their wireless charging case and a new black color for air pots too anyway if you're excited for all of this then leave a like down below and subscribe to
