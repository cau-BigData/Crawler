hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today's the 28th is the last day of our daily vlogs so it's kind of sad at the same time because we had so much fun together while we were recording the videos for 14 days and now it came to an end and I'm still full of ideas full of energy and I'm still good except i can say that it took a little bit on my mental state and all my routines because i usually my routines are a lot different then if i have to record a video every single day so that was kind of a change that happened indeed 14 days and i also wanted to experience this kind of small change in my life and see how i want it happen basically because i never knew how it felt to record every single day video and even some days was pre-recorded because i went away so that was a really interesting to do and it was kind of fun honestly because it kind of has the garage and kind of a sign that you need to post the video that day any was fun it was so much fun I enjoyed it and I hope you enjoyed it too but it came to an end and it's kind of sad now i'm going to quickly amount a few things number one is back we're going to have daily videos for seven days that means for one week one full week when i will be in scotland and that's going to be in april so that's not so long from now it's only like a month in one weeks away so that's not so much you know the venice blogs they're going to be similar to those except probably little better and i want to shoot many videos of gypsum journey so be sure to be tuned the when and when it's posting those videos because of course i'm going to put more effort into them and they're going to go out probably like a week or so after slowly because i'm going to be editing them because we're going to go all over Scotland so I don't want to put it in one it's not really worth it I was not as good not so much because then it will be too long than too short and so on so I want to put it into one like each place go to i'm going to say anything i'm gonna make a video about this so i'm going to be shooting two video every day or so that's going to be kind of fun also so that's going to be your daily video that I'm going to put these are going to be probably my favorite ones because it's going to be Scotland and it's going to be interesting to restain in some weird places that some of them may not even have really a really good Wi-Fi so that's gonna be interesting to upload videos that is them and make them every day because invented the internet will excellent at the hotel so it took me like half an hour to oppose it so yeah that's going to be an interesting factor in expecting concentration and of course either live in Europe I'll have to take a plug there's adapter thing ah a lot of tacking more go into that and actually it's going to be fun yeah it's going to be fun but yeah and then Ben is going to be a problem because daily videos from April then euros i may june and it's like summer holidays but probably i'll have maybe two weeks of daily videos in june or just for solides and it's kind of a problem towards the end for the other half of june because they'll have probably a lot of time and everything's and i'll be able to make videos every single day but then tense we're going to see and that's quite far away so i'm not going to say any promises now i'm going to probably announce it probably in like a couple months and i'm going to say it and one of them has andheri videos and one more thing is that basically i would want to put i'm going to go back to the normal schedule what is 23 videos a week so i'm going to probably due monday wednesday friday that's i find great days for making videos and so that's gonna be three times the weekend it's going to start next to notice because today is Tuesday and kind of wanna relax little bit from this video's there's going to be up for the video on friday and then next week we start with our schedule all right take care and I'll see you in the next video don't forget subscribe in life thanks bye [Music] you
