hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are looking at the 20/20 iPad pro which is surprisingly going to have a triple camera setup we got some images from on leaks and today I would like to go over them and see what we will be most likely seeing in 2020 on the new iPad pro it could be coming within the next few months but more about that later in the video these images are the best look we will get due to on leaks very good track record over the past few years of course the first thing we notice is the triple camera setup on the back of the iPad which is quite unexpected to say the least I have always said that cameras on an iPad aren't very useful since now we have much smaller devices that fit in our pockets with three or four cameras but that's just me it will most likely have the same specs as the iPhone 11 Pro so it doesn't really make sense to have the three cameras there it is said that the only difference between the iPhones and the 20/20 iPad pro will be the new time-of-flight camera it will help with a our augmented reality and it will perform better and analyzing the depth in the image and much more with the time-of-flight camera it might be better and it could make it more useful however still doesn't give the full potential to three cameras on an iPad the one thing we don't know though is from what the iPad will be made of on leaks and some other sources have been saying that it could be made out of glass but if we look at the past we have never seen glass on the iPad and it's most likely going to be made of aluminum now could the iPad finally be different maybe or maybe not on the front the camera might match the iPhone by adding more megapixels and face ID will be getting better as well due to the new camera the face ID camera will have a wider angle similar to the one on the new iPhones which means that it will definitely be able to capture more of your face in the environment but still not as a flat surface most likely so it will definitely be better but not as good as on the iPhone 11 series the speed upgrades to face ID will most likely be kept for the iPhone 12 coming later this year so there shouldn't be many speed improvements on the iPad Pro regarding face ID inside the iPad we should be seeing an a 13 X processor which makes sense compared to the past years as always the iPad after the iPhone release got an X series which is basically just an improved processor so it will have some minor changes and might get a little faster but definitely nothing a major one liek that might be coming or might not come in 2020 is the display the display had some changes in the past but now it might go to micro LED which would be a massive improvement for the iPad however we could also be seeing OLED but that's very expensive technology so the cheaper micro LED might be the way to go or we'll just have to stay at LCD I believe it's finally time to make some changes to the display as it's really time and it needs the change otherwise all the other features and changes would not be enough to make someone buy a new iPad pro the three cameras could be a key feature but it is definitely not going to be the main one on the iPad pro now finally when will we be seeing the new iPad pro well probably between now and March is a good bet since Apple already changed their release cycle this year for the iPad however we could see it as late as October 2020 laughter the iPhones which would bring many more changes to it but that's just speculation well we'll have to wait and see that's all we can do if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these and also if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you next video by [Music]
