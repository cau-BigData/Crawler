yo guys and welcome back to a brand new video vlog this is something I wanted to talk about since a while now well if I say since a month now but let's let me show you something cool that I have now I bought myself this thing it's so amazing like a speed dual charger because like I had two charges but this charge is so quickly okay that's one positive thing now some people may take this like hooray finally something cool and some people may take this like are you serious or something like that I this I'm sorry for the people who enjoy games on my channel and like Minecraft and like other games like that but there are many people who enjoy blogs more than the gaming videos and that's the thing that it's kind of also hard to to say to you guys but since we are all grouped together with 160 subscribers I wanted to share that my channel is going to turn into a vlogging channel ok now I'm not making any promises I'm going to I'm i know i'm not gonna make big promises but i'm gonna make you one promise i'm going to have videos twice or three times a week ok most probably twice like how we have it now probably like you see maybe monday and an on monday and friday or something like that i'm gonna choose something and i'm gonna share that with you guys little later but i want to say I'm publishing this video a little earlier than my channel is going to change in two with ice blocks my name is going to be changed so the new name is gonna be wet eyes vlogs and you're going to have mostly vlogs on my channel right don't be sad and and be happy I don't make anyone sad but look I'm gonna explain it a simple way I enjoy doing vlogs more than gaming videos I'm gonna say this like this I've been gaming doing gaming videos as I said in one of my videos since September 2015 so more than a year now a urine and like two months or so so that's that's quite a long period of time for me to understand what's going on and I went through this is my second channel I have and I've said that already and I'm gonna explain that maybe in another video because it's quite interesting what happened and I finally understood like recently what really happened but back to this video I enjoy making vlogs alright as you saw i put more effort into those blogs and i'm going to go more into public and that's what i want to improve okay i'm going to improve that by a gigantic lot because i have a couple of nonsense that i'm gonna make a little later probably towards like december or end of november because there's gonna they're going to be many days even weeks even months that i may evoke daily so you're gonna have a daily video of log so that sounds to be pretty cool but as you can use you understand probably hopefully you understand that i'm going to be making this change now you may be asking yourself when are you going to make this change now i have videos I'm going to continue recording videos up til December 15th okay so oh yeah december 15 so that's one more month of Minecraft videos and other games or whatever okay but there will be also vlogs now like this and they're going to be more bad badger badger badger badger badger that's that's what's going to be and if you like see on December 15th like a new thumbnail and like a new name and all a bunch of stuff like that then don't be surprised that's why I'm making this video okay cuz right now it's called a test gamer because I've been doing gaming videos and i'm going to change it to white eyes blogs all right now it's it's going to be better like this because i want to give out positivity not negativity so but if i want to give positivity I want to do something that I really enjoy and something that you guys will enjoy also and I'd wanna like come to a video on like okay bye no I'd want to do that I want to be excited I want to like have fun and this is what I love doing right so you know I hope you'll accept it no I'm expecting some some D subscribing and a bunch of stuff like that but you know there are many people watching both I think on my channel but it's going to make them sad without the games now I'm not saying that I'm gonna stop gaming forever totally never again on the other hand what I'm going to do I'm gonna post some game or something whenever you know I find something to post or or have something that I really want to share with you guys that I worked on or something so they're gonna be occasional kind of gaming videos but not gonna be like this that I have pretty much to three times a week of video games so my channel I'm gonna have two or three videos a week that means it's going to go a little down but more quality alright guys I hope I explained everything quite good if you enjoyed this video please leave a like down below it'll be greatly apprec did and subscribe and if you unsubscribe December 15 I'm sorry that I did this to you but no okay take care and I'll see you in the next video
