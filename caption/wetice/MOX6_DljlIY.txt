hello everyone welcome back to another video today I would want to talk about my 3-month experience with the MacBook Pro I can say that it has some pros and cons this is actually my first MacBook Pro ever and I haven't been happy overall with the experience now I haven't been happy because of a really frustrating problem so let's start at the beginning I got this laptop in December of 2018 and until about mid January everything worked well I used it everyday and loved how it performed however after about a month of usage and became a nightmare the computer became slow at first which I thought could be because of an update however that wasn't the culprit after some time the kernel task started taking up all of the CPU this is the core of the Mac OS as it is in charge of cooling the computer what it does is prevent other applications from using the CPU in order to cool the laptop this process cannot be stopped through the Activity Monitor after about two weeks since the problem started and became apparent that I couldn't do anything about it I tried everything from restoring to factory defaults adjusting some settings and doing a Diagnostics test on the laptop itself that is when I understood the true severity of the problem the Diagnostics tests revealed that there was a problem with the SMC more commonly known as the system management controller I further investigated on the internet and found some tips and possibly resetting the SMT controller Thank You Apple nothing changed with repeated attempts of resetting the SMC this is what I investigated more and found that there may be an issue with the logic board this would require me to go to the Apple Store the next day I actually went to the Apple Store to have it fixed at first glance in the store when I arrived they didn't really know what was wrong with it which kind of surprised me so off it goes to the Apple repair shop after about two weeks which is actually lightning speed over here I got the report from the repair shop the logic board which houses the SMC was pretty much dead so there it is after less than two months of usage the logic board managed to fail luckily I was still under warranty and it had been replaced for no additional costs imagine if I wasn't under warranty I would probably have to pay like five hundred dollars what surprised me even more was how common the problem is in these laptops there are hundreds of open questions and forums all over the place with different tips on how to fix the SMC however there was very little instruction as how to proceed if the SMC reset doesn't actually fix the problem if you encounter this problem and you're still under warranty then don't even bother fixing it and just go to the Apple Store and they'll probably fix your problem as it is the logic board now enough of complaining let's talk about the pros the MacBook Pro is lightning fast doing pretty much everything I throw at it Photoshop Lightroom Premiere Pro which are one of my most used apps work like a charm it is an amazing laptop for video editing and picture editing and it comes even in such a compact form with a lot of speed it's amazing when you're traveling in three words what I can say is I love it so this is the end of my three months with this laptop including a two week repair period I wasn't very happy about the failure but the pros outweigh the one only con I could find I would for sure recommend this laptop for any future buyers with a significantly high budget as it isn't a really cheap laptop however no other problems since I've been very happy since and I would really recommend it but anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and for more videos like this okay take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Music] you [Music]
