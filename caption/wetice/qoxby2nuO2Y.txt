hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are finally starting to look at iOS 14 rumors we're going to take a look at which devices are said to support I was 14 and I can say that it is quite impressive there are some older devices that I would never have thought to be supported this far and we are also going to look at some rumoured features for iOS 14 all right let's get into this video you might have heard that in the past Apple removed support for upgrades to software on older devices because of the battery they wanted to preserve the lifetime of your phone but some people took it in the wrong way either way the news picked it up as Apple trying to make users buy new iPhones but that was not the case last year many devices got supported and even some quite old ones this year it said that the supports will be extended to even more devices than before now which will be supported out of the iPhones let's start with those of course the iPhone 11 series the entire X s and X R series the iPhone 8 series and 7 series and this is where I thought it would stop but it also includes the iPhone 6 S series and the old iPhone S II now I feel like the iPhone 6 S series won't be supported this year anymore because Apple was said to remove a support for it last year however they extended support for it for one more year but I think it's going to be the end now what about the iPads the entire iPad pro series the generation 5 6 and 7 and the iPad Mini 5 as well as the iPad air 3 will be supported this is really good news as many of your older devices will be supported if you remember I was 13 brought a ton of new features but they came with so many bugs it is quite stable now but the start was quite rough bloomberg reported a while back that Apple wants to focus on the bugs more in iOS 14 now you know the trend big update one year and then the second year we get a small update mostly focusing on the bugs and the things they did wrong in the previous update so all this is shaping Iowa's 14 to be a bug fixing and a very stable update this will be great news for older devices as they will focus on performance which will make iOS 14 even better for you however for the newer devices there will be a lot less features which is quite disappointing now let's look at what features we could be seeing on ios 14 one thing that is very annoying is the UI for calling you you know when you are just doing something on your phone like browsing the internet or playing games and then you get a call it fills up the entire display it is very frustrating and you can't hang up otherwise the person will know that you don't want to talk to them so you end up looking at the screen for 10 20 seconds waiting for it to end now the software engineer at Apple said that we might be seeing this sometime in the future this is definitely not confirmed but it could be underway as Apple has acknowledged it we have so many different concept of how it might look and they are quite cool look at this one it could be a banner that you could swipe out of and it will basically save your life another feature we could be seeing is more enhanced augmented reality because Apple has been working on it a lot recently there could be new animations for swiping and closing app and for the 20/20 iPhone will be seeing 5g support there for iOS 14 will support 5g even though bloomberg reported that Apple would focus more on improving the software they also said that we will see quite a few features of course this is all we know for the moment but hopefully there will be more soon we are still five months away of course so there is definitely still enough time for new features to be revealed all their devices will be supported which is great news and with that great news it's time the end of the video if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this and also it helps me out tremendously also please consider watching my previous video ok take care and I'll see my next video bye [Music] you
