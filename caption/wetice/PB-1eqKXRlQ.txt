hello everybody and welcome back to another video today I would like to show you the best settings you can select to have a great high quality video on your Canon ATD but before we do please consider leaving a like and subscribing as it is all greatly appreciated let's start with the frame rate you have many different options here if you select 60 frames per second then you can have a great slow motion video if you do some manipulation in your editing software you can also have the choice of 30 FPS frames per second which is the most common resolution at which people shoot videos and then finally you have 24 frames per second which gives you a cinematic look and you will get more motion blur as well next the picture profile as this is important if you want to color correct in post-production by default your camera welcome with the automatic one but I recommend that you change that the best way is to use n1 which is neutral then by hitting neutral you can select sharpness contrast and saturation by playing around with these you can see which one fits best your style next audio levels which is very important as well to have great videos you need good audio and good video to adjust this setting you have to go to the menu down to the fourth option and sound recording it is normally set to auto as well but it is best if you are using an external microphone to set it to manual I then set the recording level to the lowest possible as this way the external microphone can do the rest next auto focus the Canon a TD has very good auto focus by default by selecting the auto focus setting you get three options most of the time I use space tracking and flex his own single when I'm in the image then I use face tracking but when I really want a precise auto focus on some object then I use flexi zone single digital zoom you go into your menu and hit the third option then you head digital zoom three to ten times which will give you a three time zoom on the image you got this of course works at whatever focal length however be careful as you can zoom in up to ten times but the more you go the more image quality you lose next is so if you want a very good video and not have a lot of noise then you should go to the lowest ISO possible of course keeping the exposure good basically the lower the ISO the better the image and the higher the ISO the noisier the image and finally image stabilization you should use image stabilisation lenses if you shoot by holding the camera in your hand now I would like to show you an image that is without stabilization as you can see it is a very shake and makes it a really bad shot however once you turn on the stabilization the shot is way more stable than before this is the end of the video these are some basic tips that I use all the time to make my videos the best they can be please leave a like and subscribe as it is greatly appreciated and let me know if you have any suggestions for some future videos in the comments down below okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
