good morning guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so as you can see we're starting the vlog in the hotel and now we're going to go on an adventure today we have a long trip through Scotland straight ahead so that's going to be fun we're going to maybe go explore a little ways but we should get to Inverness tonight hopefully and we have many stops along the way that's going to be some fun but now we're leaving the hotel and we're going to our car here we go we are leaving the hotel so our first stop is a small town or city of birth and that's not so far from here is only maybe 50 or 60 kilometres and then we'll look around there and then we have some more things planned so yesterday we also set up all our way points on the GPS so we're all set today yesterday those kind of a mess a little bit because we were going with the GPS so now that's that's good [Music] a little bit each other's nice as we expected but now happy birthday I remember the name but to sit there and we're going to look at that and then risen [Music] it seems so unreal all right we just arrived some kind of cafe over on the road you know and we're going to have a small sub for drink a little bit and then we're going to continue the road but the GPS sometimes it's funny way 60 but it always takes us to some nice here we go arrived at the dam and fish ladder that that's how this place is called I see you spineless kind of an amazement to get around to here because you know our GPS told us to go somewhere else and this told us the signs told us differently so well that was kind of unfortunate but we came we see it well we don't but we're gonna see it and we're gonna get some footage here we go we're going upstairs look at the damn but it's looking so nice and it's like no previous shot you can even cause it to read something about it but the Salmons as you can see behind me they climb up to go upstream and then they pass the dampness that's nice a feature for further fish another wise the water goes down of course so now let's go get some views from the top [Music] holy God all right so we're on top as you can see it's a really nice view from up here and now we're going to go back down because well it's a just one time see it's really amazing how they particularly trust the end even catch fish around here so that's recognized anywhere you go [Music] anywhere you go not me p alright walking back to the car so we had it not nice views from the dam but now time to move to the next spot what we'll see in the car but also funny because we never know where we're going and we're continuing our trip today [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] here we go we arrived to some kind of hotel restaurants where we're going to have lunch we're going to have lunch and then we're going to go to the distillery just to look around and see what they offer and then we're going to continue to even s and then we're going to go to a castle so that's i started the plan that's why i'm so so knowledgeable with all this but let's go eat here we go after a great lunch time to continue our travel today great lunch fish and chips and now time to go further and further [Music] so it is so we found this beautiful spot just like that from the highway well highway not really highway but it's beautiful even I have so many nice shots of it but we're we're I'm even so happy that we took these roads to come here because it's insanely beautiful so yeah and there's also lock not so far from here we're gonna go try to look at it but we don't know if we can hear anything do you see me I'm hidden here again ergo we arrived at the doll Winnie distillery oh my god the sun's coming out and I just put my glasses away and we are here we're going to maybe get the tour of the place or something and then we're going to continue but let's get it short walks through the place and route it was nice inside even outside it's a nice distillery and now we're going to continue and I think our next opted-in evenness so that's over me [Music] well here we go we came somewhere we got lost again that's what we do anyway always so we got lost now we're trying to go find our hotel but we wandered off in some directions just to look around and well guess what we got lost and now we are going to go back and hopefully find the hotel me well the beer the bear lodge is not even on the GPS and we found it because I was you know looking at the signs and everything and when the smallest sign error to find this hotel or whatever laws and we found it so all of us are happy but there was like a large like an very steep hill it was kind of scary but we're here finally after the whole day now even a funnier fact is that we don't even know if it is the correct the correct large or correct hotel or whatever you want to call it but yeah let's let's try to look I don't know if we are in the great spot but we just walked into someone's please well we were right so it was the correct spot we found it very nice people inside so now we're going to go have some food because we got recommended that if we go too late and there's going to be too many people and if you go now it's going to be great so let's go ahead so we found some kind of place what we got recommended from mark at the hotel and so it's called the loch ness in that we're going to have dinner tonight let's see what it's like and I'll tell you afterwards but maybe i'm going to go edit a video still from Edinburgh that's kind of funny and then we're going to go back home ok here we go out of the restaurant it was a great dinner in in this nice kind of spot not so far from our Lodge and now we're going to go to our Lodge and enjoy the evening and it is one video and render and upload so I did quite a lot of stuff during dinner and now it's time to go and now I may edit one more video but so far this will do it for this video if you enjoyed we should leave a like down below it will be
