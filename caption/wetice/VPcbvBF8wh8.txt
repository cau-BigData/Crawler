hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some interesting news about air power and the ipod touch 7 these products might be coming today let's take a look why but if you're excited for this video you know what to do go leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more well we know that air power isn't out yet but there has been a leaked image on Apple's website yes on Apple's website that this product could be coming today or in the very very near future Michael Bateman tweeted in this tweet right here that he found references about air power in Apple's web site on the Australian and Indian sites it's not available on the US sites so it can be a mistake it can be on purpose no one knows but Apple leaked an image of how the air power could potentially look what is interesting is that this is the first acknowledgment that Apple has ever made in a very long time or even leaking their own thing for the first time ever in a very long time so therefore of it safe to say that as this week Apple has been releasing tons of new products from air pods to IMAX who a lot of other stuff we could be seeing air power today as you know yesterday we did not get any products but today we can hope for the best and get them now from this image here we can see that Apple changed a little bit the design not much but just a little bit but they say that they changed a ton on the inside as you know in the past they had problems where the device was overheating and it wasn't safe for use so they fixed all that apparently and it's safe to be released what also can kind of confirms this could be coming is that air pods to with the wireless charging case was released on Wednesday meaning that you need wireless charging mad for it so potentially this could mean that air power is on the way let's talk about ipod touch seven now so it could be coming as well today there are some new rumors where basically we should be seeing the April Bionic chip on that iPod as they put it in the iPad so it makes sense for them to put it in the iPod Touch 7 as well also I know that many people love the iPod Touch including some of my friends so I think it's safe to say that it's gonna be a good product for Apple to release this product could be coming on Friday as well as well as air power so then we just have to wait it's today 7 a.m. PST hopefully we can see something hopefully maybe maybe now I would love to hear what you think about these two products and whether or not you'll be buying them in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more well yeah we still have a couple days before the event so there's still time for Apple to release some stuff so it's safe to say we couldn't be seeing them yeah we can wait and see anyway this is the end of the video so I hope you enjoyed it don't forget to leave like and subscribe and all that thank you very much and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
