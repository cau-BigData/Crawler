hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video welcome back today is another awesome day to be recording a video now today I'm going to answer one of my frequently asked questions that I also have written in the description down below and you just saw that coming soon this video coming will be coming soon now these questions will ask on Twitter also so I'm going to be answering this question very very briefly and simply that this is the easiest way I can explain it there we go alright so as you can see here this frames gonna look a little weird but on the table right here we have three things now first of all this is the camera I use to record my videos typically now I'm recording this video on a g7 X so this one's different now this camera is a OS 100 D as you can see here it's a great camera I really love it when you have it a manual setting it's an awesome camera now I'm soon gonna change it so this video is gonna be relevant soon anyway okay now I lens that I use on it it's a simple simple lens can you like focus please it's just the normal standard lens that comes with your camera so it's the 18 to 65 millimeter lens what's a perfect lens if you want to just like sit and talk no it cannot be ultra like ultra large few thing that's not very good if you're sitting and making these kind of vlogs because then it captures too much off the background so it's not so if you use this camera in manual settings it's the perfect camera you can have to record these videos now moving on we have this microphone so this is a rode microphone from Road what can I say it's this I think it's kind of a standard microphone it's not the top of the top but it's not necessary because all of my videos sound great in my opinion otherwise there we go so I'm I'm pretty sure this does a great job even in like a cooler rooms if I could say this room is not the least echoes place in the entire world so this microphone really reduces the echo what I'm really really happy with that one I don't even know how this video is gonna turn out because I don't know then g7x how it how well it goes with we let go but so this second accessory it just do one like thing that bothers me is that it requires battery 9-volt batteries now the my camera this one here this one requires normal batteries normal Canon battery so if that could be connected and it could be siphoning the batteries from the Canon be great because whenever I'm home I record and I have it plugged the - I have the camera plug - like the socket with like an adapter so I don't need to worry about battery but I have to worry about batteries for the microphone - now moving on we have this little thing this thing is like the best thing in the entire world this saves me a lot one broke down in Scotland which was a sad story this is the battery pack for the Canon one d and well it's a pain in the butt to find these so this one's quite this actually these are quite for a reasonable price on Amazon they're very low I could not find a battery pack that was good actually the trick with these is that you couldn't you have to be very careful when putting in the batteries and you have to be very careful whenever you're taking the batteries out and working with it so you have to be careful with it because yeah there you go I don't know so you can put two batteries in here just like this if you open this up you have you can put two batteries already one in there take it out there we go take it out and you just put the battery back in and just push it in so there we go it's a perfect little little system there we go so this is what I used to record my videos so these are the three main things that I used to record my videos there are very simple things that are not really that's not like a really professional thing so it's just these three things that do the entire trick and do the entire work well no I don't know if I should count like a tripod if I should count the lights there we go I just covered what I used to record my videos so there we go just this a tripod and like two two lights to light up myself there we go that's pretty much it but anyway guys this will do it for this video if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video take care bye [Applause] [Music]
