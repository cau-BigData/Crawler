hello guys welcome back to another video how are you today today we're doing something completely different than we usually do because today we are going to install my storage system for all my videos that I piled up over a couple of years now and we're going to do that today we're going to first unbox it and then we're going to go plug it and put some files on it here is the box as you can see it's from kuna storage system this is it if you want to look what it is now let's open it and let's see what's inside alright let's see there's some kind of welcome note here and see what's inside so he did box some cable alright so that the power there's some internet cables and that's about and some screws and a manual moving on you have this plastic bag with a cable for the power and the thing itself is here and here is the whole thing so protection alright alright so here is the storage this is the whole thing the drives go here in front this one goes one here and one here here's like the power buttons and stuff some lights and then you have a you a you have a USB and then from the back there are just two Ethernet ports and a couple USB and the power port and a USB see if you will need that they give you a quick set up installation guide I don't know what that says but we'll see what that does alright so we have the storage box over here now these are the two things or you have to put the drives so we I have a 2 4 terabyte ones this one and this one so this is 144 terabyte one and this is the others so this will be on raid together will to give me 4 terabytes of storage now I have to figure out how to mount them into the two racks what's actually in the instruction manual so that should not be too difficult alright so I figured out actually some screws here so these kind of screws what are these they're kind of like silver ish these go there's eight of them and they go to tighten it so now we need to find a screwdriver but I did not figure out where the black ones go so that's gonna be interesting but I'm gonna just take a screwdriver find which one is the proper one to go the holes are here where you just put the screw like there and that's gonna hold it in place okay lost the screw alright so now I'm going to just screw all of them all [Music] the screws are in place from this side the disks is holding in and normally now you should just be able to slide it in now let me see how I think this way take this closer and I think you should just slide it in like that and it's in so I'm going to repeat everything on this one because this one's not holding it alright so here it is I put both of the disks in there all set in there not falling out or anything so now we're going to turn it on follow the manual I'm going to take you through it briefly with some shots and then we're going to look at the final final product okay so as you can see here it is now we're going to power it on using where I cannot see using this button here okay turned on okay there's air coming out okay it's making it it's on okay now I'm going to open the laptop and we're going to do everything to set it up and now as you can see I'll show you in a moment it's just formatting applying some settings so we're creating like a personal cloud or whatever this is right now and then we're going to continue the instruction all right then we set the storage up we have some file on it so this is the end it just took quite a long time to install and just kind of play with all the storage settings and everything so that's really you should consider that that you need a lot of time to play around with the settings but it's working and you can access all your files and it just works perfectly so this is it and if you enjoyed be sure you like down below and subscribe if you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next video bye
