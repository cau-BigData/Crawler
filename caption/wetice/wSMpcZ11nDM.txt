hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today again another awesome day to record a video and is it show pretty much but today I want to talk about the topic that's very very interesting for me at least and for any content creator who makes this kind of content has to come up with ideas now to come up with ideas it's quite hard for me sometimes but sometimes it's it's quite easy now that depends of the mood you're in sometimes just come up with many many ideas at once but sometimes just have to really really really think now brainstorming is an awesome awesome way of getting ideas so just take a piece of paper and you just start writing down ideas that come up to your mind and the stupid ones you just cross out now that's a simple way of doing something like this very easy now the next thing is browsing the Internet well there's many ideas on the internet you can just look around you can see something that you like reading that maybe some other people would enjoy you know like looking at so you can make that into an idea for a video or then you just come up with your personal experience idea so whatever happened to you a story time or um or just something that you want to talk about that song that has been on your mind for a while now these are like three kind of main and you can like branch off from all of these to like different ideas different different I mean you can go from an idea to an idea but sometimes happens to me when I'm recording a video and I'm talking about a specific topic while speaking about that specific topic I come up with another idea and I sometimes even mention it in the video so idea from the very it's like another one that you can you can find and that's just by speaking about the topic that you're speaking about that day you just you just have an idea and it's and it's really simple and and it's really really great and then whenever you finish recording you just write down the idea and you just think about it and and you think if the idea is worth making a video or like with the idea now sometimes these ideas don't are not used so sometimes my ideas are are stupid that's why I cancel them out now sometimes these ideas are great and I want to keep them for later because I don't feel like this is the proper time to make the video with that idea now this is what I do most commonly that I usually brainstorm brainstorm then I write down my ideas and I'll leave it there for two days I read them everything them and sometimes more ideas pop up now that's what happens sometimes now I use like notes to write down my ideas be sure to always write down your ideas I have like 10 ideas in there now just something fell off it was kind yeah I have like 10 ideas in my notes so basically I can choose ideas whenever I want to and what I feel to record that's also another big part in it that would you feel like you want to record now if you don't feel like recording with that idea you can record that idea and that's why it's great to have multiple ideas on your list at once not just one because then you don't have to brainstorm so often you just have to think whenever you want to make another idea not use the idea you have already written that's an awesome way to just kind of have ideas non-stop this kind of process takes time to develop but overall whenever you start you will see that first of all you start with stupid ideas and then you're gonna get more creative and more more more more like you're gonna think and you're going to really know how to process and like sort the ideas you come up with whether they're crap or great so there we go anyway guys this is just a short video to explain how I come up with my ideas for videos now maybe there's some creators that are watching my videos so let me know in the description down below how you come up with your idea or even if you're like uh if you're doing something else how do you come up with your ideas anyway take care subscribe and leave a like it's greatly appreciated of course and comments I love reading your comments and answer to all of your comments so they care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Applause] [Music]
