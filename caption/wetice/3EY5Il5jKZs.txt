hey guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so today their second day and we're gonna go to Dundee that's the plan for today that's where we're going to sleep eventually today hopefully but until then we're going to just go see the forth bridge for example and then many more little stops on the way to dundee and i think there we have something very close to dundee afterwards and then the hotel for the night so that's the plan for today dunno we know Oh [Music] bring is she cool don't use the shipping news I bridge now I don't know I think it's Quinn's Mary's bridge or something like that I just read signs and I don't know if I'm I'm not very good at sign the names bridges are here behind me so we're going to take some pictures and maybe spend some videos of course and then i'll show you right now so maybe you can even capture and train I just caught the train but I did not have the correct lens [Applause] ok so after a nice view we are back in the car and we are going to our next place what is the a bird or castle we just set a few waypoints on the GPS to go there and we'll see how that goes because it's good it can be fun we just have some great like I think 80 or 90 kilometres to go and then we'll be there as an ice castle we have like two or three castles today so that can be nice and [Applause] [Music] well we arrived through some kind of spot here now I don't know I was not vlogging with this camera for a while I don't know if I'm in focus or anything but we are going to see the sea or the like or I don't know what the hell it is anymore and we're going to get some shots [Music] not haha so we walked down here and as you can see behind me there's the sea and there's also an oil rig whoa that we're going to try to capture with another lens and otherwise it's beautiful around here so we just arrived to some kind of small place with a view so that's our main purpose why we came here and when we escaped like the windy area it immediately gets like hotter outside because otherwise it's so cold and even the footage will be better without the wind and there's not so much way and maybe it maybe it sounds horrible but not not so much wind and we're gonna go look at some of you and maybe have like we're gonna go have a drink or something if it's open well it's been like two minutes and we're going back because there's nothing here if you close and it doesn't seem to be the best place ever to do something around here so we're going we're going back somewhere else so we got out of the car and now we should find the castle because we follow some signs you told us to park in a parking lot over here but we don't know if it's correct or something because the castles we don't see it so well for you but we're going to try to walk around and maybe find the castle without moving the car [Music] p here we go I think we found it it's right in front of me hopefully it's not a different castle but i think it's the correct castle it looks really nice so far from here but it's behind the bushes so we don't know yet but i think it's going to be beautiful in general we just have to go up and look at it [Music] Oh so part of the castle has been destroyed and part of it is revealed as you can see behind me there's the castle partying here is revealed so I don't know mixed feelings about that baby I mean it's not in any way and it's kind of interesting that half of industry built in half of it is this [Music] I was appealing [Music] we found a small little Pete place Pierre room where we can we're going to have some tea and coffee and so on so it's very nice it's really nice small place we're going to sit outside because there are these small knives benches where you can sit it's really really nice and you're going to enjoy your a cup of tea or coffee or whatever you want it's a really great great place at the castle oh and maybe I forgot to mention this castle is called the a bird or castle maybe I already mentioned it but I just want to read mention it again it's in a small villagers town of a birder and you can come look at it here alright so we finished at the castle finally it was a really nice castle we had tea as i said in the previous shot and we are going back to the car and we are going to our next destination what is i don't know what we're going to see in the car we have it all in our plan so we're going to see where that takes us [Music] [Music] so we are trucking along and we are following some kind of tourists roads like tourists coastal roads so whenever you come here just try to follow some kind of coastal roads because they are going to get some amazing views of the coast because there are rolls along the coast so that's really really nice I just follow the signs and you use you should see some tities Oh [Applause] Oh [Music] football
