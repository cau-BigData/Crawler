hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video now we're reaching our last week of baby videos but it doesn't mean that another one is not coming I'm not gonna spoil it or anything but today we're going to look at some things you're doing online and they're probably legal every single day now I just went through the list a little bit and I can tell you that it's quite accurate number one I don't fishel see any streaming services now everyone's done that that they watch something on an official you know like you go to whatever page and you watch it there for free of course but you know that happens and those websites are there for a reason for the people who don't really have the money for you know like nice place to stop or if you live in a country where Netflix is crap that's a better example I think many of us faked a name for example for an Instagram of Facebook or whatever profile you don't put your real name unless you really want to but once in your life you actually probably faked your name for sure like yeah for sure well I've done this connecting to unsecured non-public Wi-Fi now probably most of us have done this even maybe by accident that you for example in a restaurant and there was an open Wi-Fi so you profit the restaurant there's something for join and you were using their Wi-Fi now I know that it's illegal but you know mistakes happen sometimes it happens sometimes you just you know stupid and happens so you know what can you do really unlocking your iPhone and illegal also jailbreaking is still technically legal as objected personally unlocking your phone to use across carriers isn't what what whatever I understand what they say but then it's illegal now I just lost my phone so OH clicking save image as is actually illegal now most of us know this because there's this copyright law some of you probably know it quite well but in YouTube it works the same way you can now download something that's more yours or otherwise you'll get a copyright strike and so on so just if you would save as I mean if it's illegal but if you use it just for yourself and put it on a wall paper or something then I think you're free to use it but if you don't spread it around or make pictures out of it or something then you need to either agree with the creator of the image or just do something like that you cannot steal it and do your thing because that's illegal yeah now sharing passwords is illegal everywhere but I have never done that you never should tell someone your password because then it may end up really bad for you and it's not going to be pleasant if you do that because sometime your friend or whoever you give the password to we can turn to be an absolute jerk and you will just you know do whatever we want to hear account and you'll not be very happy about that but you know just don't share your password your password is your personal thing don't share it please don't share it underage Facebook account so I know that there are many people many kids that make an account when they're younger than 13 and they put the fake date of birth that way you know Facebook and not really do anything but you know yeah don't do that because I mean it's illegal but no one will really find out because no one has a message to check you yet but I think it's gonna soon come yeah here we go uploading copyrighted content to YouTube is illegal as you can see if it talked about that as you can see it seriously go you cannot like take your favorite show or something and put it on YouTube and put public or whatever just so you cannot do that it's illegal it's not yours it's someone and you did not make it so don't spread it around but anyway guys this will do it for this video if you enjoyed be slim like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future I really hope you're enjoying this baby Street now it's kind of sad that we're soon landing this but anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video tomorrow bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music]
