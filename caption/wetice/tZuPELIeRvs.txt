welcome back guys how are you today today's another great day as I say always today we have something special planned today I got some stuff today all of these are SD cards and one of them is a box for SD card so today I wanted to talk about the topic which is the cards are great for pictures with dress D cards are great for video and how to use any cards properly let's say so I have a bunch of SD cards right here plus some more that came SD cards die quickly with me I understand so these are all the SD cards that I have some of these are useless some of these I use a lot so the ones that I use a lot break very quickly since they're such a crappy design there's this small thing there's this kind of small thing here where basically this breaks off like so easily I don't understand what happens it just breaks I broke so many of them if you can get few more SD cards I always recommend that you always label them so for example let's say here so as you can see this one here is g7 X this one here is 100 deep so what I like to do is to label them because each camera creates its own folder and then it's like a huge mess and it's great to have the SD card formatted for that camera I like the SanDisk ones I'm not sure about other ones but as you can see down there I have written one g7 X and that way I know which SD card is which oh you can write it down there it's usually quite hard to write on it but I mean you'll figure it out and it's quite simple though but it's it's difficult with a pen and that way you don't have to you know look in the computer what kind of file you have on it and you just grab it quickly and go record your video so then I have these as d cards which are like 32 gigabytes but they are more for pictures because they have a slow writing speed now this is where I'm going to get into this now writing and reading these are the two things you have on SD card now frightening is what the camera is writing on to the camera that's understandable now for example if you're recording in 4k you cannot use this one this is the right speed of 30 megabytes per second for sure you cannot use that so then all the way you can go I think I don't even know the exact number but you can go quite high up the maximum I have is 9 64 gigabyte and it's a 95 megabytes per second SD card I have two of those and those are my ultimate favorites for doing from everything literally doing everything now one of them is here and probably not gonna even get to unboxing these whenever I'm home I use this one 16 gigabyte and this is a 90 megabytes per second frightening speed so this SD card gives you a lot of functionality it's not that expensive it's very good so if it breaks I'm not going to cry if I broke or 128 gigabyte one and that hurt a little bit so yeah then I use the GoPro so you need to have micro SD cards so those are plugged in the adapters or at least I have them like that and I have I don't even know I have a 64 and a 16 and these are about 92 speed so as you can see I have these two for the GoPro or for any slot that has a micro SD card so yeah I have kind of a collection of SD cards but I use all of them and then of course I have kind of a few old ones for example this one so this one is kind of an older one and even remembers the ancient times it's an 8 gigabyte one it's very small and also the writing speed it's not that very good so this are all the SD cards that I have now it's very useful to store on view SD cards somewhere right it's very useful to put them somewhere not just having laying around like I do usually since I use them a lot that's why this box comes into place this box has 12 slots where you can put SD cards so actually that's good and I think you can buy multiples versions of this one which have like I think even like inside that you can put that microSD card under the SD card so yeah that there there are multiple versions and this is not that expensive why I like this is because so what you do you put the SD card inside like so as you can see and you just continue piling them up like that and you can go all the way down however many want you can even organize them so this is great so this is pretty much it for this video but SD card so I hope I explained all of this really well and if you have any questions be sure to leave them down in the comment section and I'll reply to all of them yeah this is it so if you have more requests about these kind of videos of course leave it down in the comments it will be also greatly appreciated and yeah this is it take care and I'll see you in my next video with something else um yeah yeah I really like this background also so that's why this is kind of like an you think yeah take care bye [Music] you
