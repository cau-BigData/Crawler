hello everyone today we're gonna be talking about the iPhone X and iPhone XS whether you should actually upgrade or not or just stick with your iPhone X so as you know Apple released their beautiful shiny new and gold colors which is a really beautiful color iphone XS there are many differences to start with but they are not very big if you compare the iPhone XS it has a more durable glass which is a really good feature if it like Falls that it doesn't break and you don't have to replace the glass and stuff which is over four hundred dollars just to replace that which is too much money it's like half of the price on the phone it's ip68 water-resistant which means your phone can fall into the water it can stay there for 30 minutes up to 2 meters so you can just dive in go get it no problems there and you're safe but it's not covered by the Apple insurance so I am not sure whether or not it actually works as they said so I mean I'm rather not gonna test that but just stay away from the pool with your phone that's that's my tip and that's what I do the display there's very minimal changes compared to the iPhone X it's just that the dynamic range was improved by 60% which is quite a lot if you think about it but the change is not very noticeable but I mean you can still try to look for it maybe you'll find a very subtle change face ID is now safer and more reliable so you spend less time and locking your phone it's gonna be a lot quicker so I guess it's gonna be a great feature and it was hopefully improved even if you want to lock your phone and dark like in low-light environments so hopefully that's a nice change to have now the biggest change like the massive change is the a12 Bionic chip it's seven nanometer chip which is actually helping the applications launch a 30% faster which is something that you can save time on as well and there's a better efficiency on the processor resulting little bit of battery-life I'll talk about that a little bit later there's a four core GPU with a six core CPU so there's an improvement and four gigs of ram which is actually all more than in the previous phone which is a nice upgrade because that you can have more apps in your background and games around a lot better with the GPU so overall a better experience smart HDR it's the new feature that has been added in the XS and XS max where you can where the phone takes multiple pictures and combines them together to give you one very beautiful picture the camera has zero shutter lag apparently which is a nice feature as well since now it takes multiple pictures at once and it combines it now shooting towards the Sun is a lot better basically since as well it combines the pictures and gives you the best picture so it's just a lot nicer with the Sun so video has been improved a very little bit it's just 2 times faster in like the autofocus the stereo recording is there with the four microphones so it record stereo audio which is nicer in video so it can really capture the audio a lot better and it's better in low light environment so it can be nice to shoot in a little bit of a darker environment a big change was the bokeh effect as well which allows you to actually modify the bokeh effect after you have taken the picture and the selfie camera is 1080p 60 frames per second while the on the previous phone it's only 30 frames per second but I don't think you really actually need to have 60 frames per second instead of 30 frames per second it's not a very noticeable difference if you just like facetiming or something it has a wider stereo sound so it's great for gaming and watching movies videos so you just have a nicer feel to it with 512 gigabytes of RAM where you can store thousands of pictures and thousands of data so if you are looking for something like that for taking a lot of pictures then this is a great option with also an one gigabit LTE band so you can browse the Internet a lot faster but that's not available we were in the world yet so I don't know whether you would have a good experience when you get the phone right now worldwide roaming support has been added which allows you to have a better roaming and it's their best roaming in the iPhones so far which is a nice feature and supporting dual SIM capability is also great because you can have two SIM cards at one so you have two numbers one personal let's say and one work primary secondary and Isom so ECM is available in many parts of the world except China where they have just two SIM cards so ECM should be rolling out throughout the world very shortly but I don't know where it's available so I don't know if you have a great experience with that at the beginning the battery life as I mentioned in the beginning of the video is improved just by 13 minutes so you're not going to have a very big improvement there but apparently Apple should release a 10 watt charger and that's gonna be allowed by a software update that hopefully we can come out with but that's not gonna be included in the box with your phone one thing that surprised me is the headphone dongle that doesn't come in the box so you have to buy it separately which is kind of ridiculous for the price they charge for the phone now the question should you upgrade well just to have a nice gold color da twelve by RNA and just a few other improvements that are not ginormous no personally I would stick with the iPhone X you still have a very good phone for I mean you don't have to upgrade if you really want to upgrade it's the iPhone XS max but prepare your wallet like your pockets have to be very deep to be able to buy a fullness $1,500 so I would stick with the iPhone X if you have an iPhone I then maybe consider upgrading to the iPhone XR or the X just something you may keep in mind is just maybe it's not the best time and maybe you should wait till next year for the upgrade anyway this is it for this video I hope you enjoyed you should leave a like down below and
