hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I would like to take a look at an iOS 13 concept by Alvaro which is linked in the description below we are only eight days away from WWDC where we will most likely see iOS 13 so this concept gives us what we should most likely be seeing but before we get into this video you know what to do please leave a like and subscribe to stay up to date with all of the iOS 13 videos coming very soon also let me know which features you are most looking forward to in the comments down below let's take a look at this concept by Alvaro which show us some new changes dark mode new features and some new apps coming starting with the iPad we can see that there is a new notification and control center it gives a new look where you do a lot of your daily activities the home screen is changed it looks like a desktop with a lot of control we see folders on the home screen which is pretty much looking like a Mac desktop I am really looking forward to this feature to have an iPad that can be more of like a desktop than just an iPad continuty is another big change coming this is basically the communication of different devices in the Apple ecosystem for example you can pick up a call on your iPad on your Mac but the quality isn't that very good yet it should be getting a lot better and seamless in the future dark mode the most exciting feature dark mode will be system-wide where you can switch between light and dark mode like on your Mac you should have controls in the control center to toggle it on and off let's take a look at the new apps and features we should be seeing the reminders app have a huge overhaul it should have more organization more categories progress bars and shared tasks it would be amazing to see this app have a refresh the music app should shake and have better search options you should have the ability not to go just through Siri to find what music is playing but maybe go through the music app itself the next app is the mail app the mail app is kind of old in 2019 so it would be great to see some new changes here as well we could be seen to add attachments waser we can sign documents in the mail app and much much more we should be seeing a new volume indicator as the one we have now is very annoying Center than the screen we should be seeing the volume indicator on the side or on the top we should be seeing Safari downloads possible on the iPad and we are expecting to see some more widgets or better set a redesign of the widget screen we could be seeing them on the home screen as well it will be so cool to have some more customization on the home screen itself with widgets and more however we don't know if Apple will be doing home screen customization but that would be really cool though the last thing that is in this concept is find my friends integration into the Maps app it doesn't make sense to have two apps so it would be cool to have a one app for both of them but we don't know what Apple will do however what we know is that there should be a redesign on the way for find my friends well this is the end of the video thank you to all vero for making this concept go check out his video the link is in the description down below also please leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest iOS 13 videos okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
