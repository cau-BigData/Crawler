hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12 point 3.14 the entire public there was no beta testing and therefore this is a big surprise the update for me was about 110 megabytes on my iPhone XS however as you can see the update size varies on the version you're coming from an on the device this update comes just two weeks after the release of iOS twelve point three meaning there must be some bug fix as this came so quickly and surprisingly but before we get into the video please leave a like down below and subscribe as it is greatly appreciated and it helps me out tremendously now let's go take a look at what's new in this beta so if we go over into settings we go to general and the About section and we click on twelve point three point one we can see that the build number is 16 F to 0-3 and there's no letter at the end meaning this is not a beta this is a four release which is stable another change here will be for devices from 2018 which would show at modem firmware 1.0 5.0 4 but since this is a older device then the modem firmware is 3.0 3.0 for this should help with connectivity issues and call it dropping the performance should be better or can stay the same depending on if you had any issues or not well these are pretty much the only changes in this beta right over here but there are some bugs that I would like to talk about and also keep watching to know if you should update or not the first thing that is fixed here is an issue that could prevent making or receiving vuelta calls voice over LTE calls so that's great that they fix it as this was kind of a major issue the second issue is fixes issues in messages that could cause messages from unknown senders to appear in your conversation list even through filter unknown senders is enabled so that's also great that it's fixed as that could cause some issues and then the third issue fixes an issue that could prevent the report junk link from appearing in messages threads from unknown senders that's great to have that fixed as well because I heard many people were having she's with that but I didn't have issues with that well besides these bug fixes there isn't anything new but you might be asking why is this such a small update the reason why there really is this update is due to these major bugs that we saw here and Apple doesn't want to wait on to the release of 12.4 so they fixed it now now what about performance and battery life so if we go over into battery this phone doesn't use battery life a lot but on my daily driver the iPhone XS i justed the battery out a little bit and it seems to be about the same as in 12.3 there's no change so I would say that 12.3 won't decrease the battery now the performance the performance isn't very good there are some issues I heard people complaining about the App Store when they would go update or when they would just browse through the App Store it wouldn't be working very well but I didn't have those problems of App Store freezing but just be aware of that one go ahead update to twelve point three point one but don't expect much connectivity is better there's quite a boost due to the firmware update I don't have any issues with Wi-Fi bluetooth or cellular and many major bugs are fixed but performance isn't that very good however I would recommend that you update to have these bugs fixed well this is the end of the video for iOS twelve point three point one if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously and also let me know down in the comments if I was to open three is good or not and how is it performing for you okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
