hello everyone originally I wanted to unbox the MacBook Pro 2019 has just got here but today's a special occasion and you know that from the title because we hit 600 subscribers on my channel that's just incredible so that's like 600 people that clicked on my video and just click Subscribe pretty much in one way or another which is just insane and here I just want to say a big fat thank you like a huge thank you like a massive thank you I couldn't have done it without you and I will not be able to do it without you in the following months and continuing on in this journey so one thing that's gonna be a big change is that we're this thing here the studio that I have right here is pretty much gonna be the set for only the next about two three weeks and then you're not gonna see this ever again so no I'm not leaving no I'm not quitting YouTube no I'm not doing any of that I am just gonna be moving from Europe all the way to Asia so you some of you probably already know where I might be going but for those that don't I am going to be living in Hong Kong for the next who knows how long hopefully for quite some time and Studios gonna be completely different for the next few weeks expect videos that are Apple related and just like this unboxing that's gonna come next week it's heavy and and a few videos like that but then as soon as I reach Hong Kong there will be a lot of things going on if you remember some people watched the Hong Kong vlogs I made the kind of like finding the perfect home videos type of thing but I never showed the actual house that we got so that's gonna be something interesting to go look at I will do for sure a house store when it's empty because it's Hugh huge and expect some videos from there and then I will kind of take you through the whole process of building my new office for example now I'm basically in this one room I do everything in a single room the studio is kind of like in the middle of the room it's it is what it is right but in the new house that we're getting it's gonna be I'm gonna have in an office like a just an office what's happening okay just an office for all of this it's gonna be super cool I am really excited about that I have some ideas about how to make it work there will be some changes in terms of video quality and audio quality I'm just super excited about all of that so I've been using this microphone this lav I year whatever Road thing I hate it honestly so be honest I hate this microphone I just don't like the sound and like I've had it for a couple of months now I just don't like the sound and and don't get me wrong this is like an expensive microphone that's like $300 or even more I think and I I just don't like I just I just don't like it but expect some changes there I will take you through the whole process of the microphones as well because that's gonna be a very big learning curve where I've never been in let's say so I've always stuck with the cameras and audio has been a thing that I let slide and lighting as well so right now I have like two soft boxes in front of me and like one overhead it's nothing really like extra the the lights are all the same but in my room I really want to do in the office in Hong Kong it's gonna be super cool I don't want to spoil anything it's just gonna be something that I'm gonna be really happy and proud about so it's gonna change from just this background right here but anyway the purpose of this video was to thank all of you every single one of you that recently subscribed or are here already for quite some time thank you thank you thank you so all the people who are commenting on my videos liking them I really appreciate that it helps me tremendously if you do that so just please do that and and yeah share it with your grandma or something would be would be great one more thing before I end it off is you know that once you had a thousand subscribers you get into the partners program of you like of YouTube and we're 400 subscribers away I mean less now as at the time of this recording but thank you just let's get the 400 subscribers going let's reach it by like spring next year would be amazing so let's get going okay well I hope you enjoyed this video thank you very much again if you missed my previous video then please keep the card shown up here it was a I don't remember what kind of video it was but but it's right here and please leave a like and subscribe as you know it helps me out tremendously and I will see you in my next video which will be I don't know when but you're gonna most likely see this thing opened up okay take care and I'll see in the next one bye [Music] [Music]
