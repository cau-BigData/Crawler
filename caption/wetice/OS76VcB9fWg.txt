hello guys welcome back to another video so today it's going to be a topic which is the Amazon echo dot generation three third generation whatever you want to call it it's this device right here and before you go hit the dislike button listen to what I have to say about it because it's not really positive so just that I'm not talking out of like nothing I had the previous second generation and now about the third generation however the third generation is actually garbage like to be honest a bigger adapter it takes more power the only real thing that I found here is it's bigger heavier and has a bigger speaker which okay it's good for some people but it's not really what I want to do and then the big part it's dead literally I plugged it in hired working for two days and all of a sudden just like goodbye so I don't know what what happened I was really optimistic about this device since its predecessor was a really good buy however now deciding between these two devices here the owners thing I can say is by the second generation it's cheaper it didn't die and it's like more practical in my opinion so I don't know what to say about this honestly I was really happy to get it it even has a nice sleek design looks a lot better but the functionality what's different nothing just the speaker's better yep the audio port well I can still breath my head around how to change the outputs or just you have to unplug the thing so well this is basically my week with this thing the buttons on the new one are also really confusing this symbol here is actually the mute which is really stupid because this is how it was before and that makes way more sense than like some kind of stupid button like that anyway I'm not gonna ask for likes or anything if you want to dislike this video and you had an amazing experience feel free to do so however if you agree with me just I'm here to help you guys and to find the best thing you can possibly buy and obviously for me it's been the second generation because it does exactly the same thing and to my testing they sound pretty much the same except it's louder which is normal because of its bigger speakers side and there's more bass because the amplifiers a little bit bigger but otherwise it's not a big deal honestly the Alexa app is still like crap but that's probably just my preference and the thing with the kind of different gadgets you can install to this it just doesn't make sense I really prefer how Google did it with their interface and not having to have some kind of features or stuff like that so it really works well I work with Google mostly now because these are just absolute trash so I hope you enjoy this video that I kind of shared my story on this by the way it is doesn't even start anymore so if amazon will watch this video which they'll probably not please contact me I don't like your device to be honest I really loved the second generation you did a great job here and I thought that in third generation there would be some improvement but the only thing I see is speaker size more power stupid symbols and the whole device being dead so that's my experience I would really like that you share your experience in the comment down below and tell me in the comment section down below as well if you experienced any of these kind of weird things so I'm gonna unplug it and see if it works again but nope I don't have big hopes for that so anyway let me know these things and leave a like if you agree and if you enjoyed the video and if you want more videos like this otherwise if you complete against this and you love it and it works perfectly for you and whatever I'm saying is absolute crap then there's like the video I won't be offended but please live like subscribe if you want me to continue making these videos and I'll see you next time with another video bye
