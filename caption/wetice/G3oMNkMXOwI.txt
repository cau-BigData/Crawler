what's up guys Apple released iOS 13.5 0.5 beta one after releasing iOS thirteen point five point one for the developers we are going to take a look at what's new the bugs the performance and the battery life some people of course didn't get iOS thirteen point five point one and that's for a very good reason because if you were on the developer profile you would not get that one but now we know why since iOS thirteen point five twenty five was released today so starting off with the update size it came in at about four point one seven gigabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max this is of course common when going from release build a public release to a beta again so the update size will be big on all the devices where you want to update so if we head over into settings and general and the About section we can see that we're running 17 G five zero three five D so the D at the end means that will be for sure getting quite a few more betas down the road if we had a little lower we can see that the modem firmware is 1.0 6.00 the previous version at least on the iPhone 11 series so what about the changes there don't seem to be any changes or differences after reading all the release notes and just looking through the entire system it was probably released to patch the jailbreak as they already did and I was thirteen point five beta one so in Iowa's thirteen point five point five beta one they do the same it was also probably released to fix some bugs from the previous version and add some security enhancement as just make the whole system better so there are no physical exchanges or features that you can actually see but I believe the performance will be the main change in this version so it feels much smoother when going through the phone multitasking is much smoother so of course everything feels much better in Geekbench scores I also saw an increase in a multi-core performance coming from iOS 13 point 5 so definitely expect performance changes here it'll probably be getting also faster mainly due to iOS 14 being just around the corner regarding battery life I really didn't have any problems with battery life in this version and in the previous 13.5 of course then it depends on how much you use your phone and what you do on the phone but it was really quite good for me so don't expect any significant upgrades to battery life in this updates it's already so far down the line in I was 13 so what is this update so the update is probably mainly for bug fixes security enhancements and overall performance increases I will be using this version over the next few days to really see if I can't find something new or if I don't find any bugs or some of the bugs that are fixed further we might not be seeing another beta next week but maybe in two weeks but there all depends on what will be the release cycle for this beta so expect maybe one on the 9th or on the 16th or on the 8th or the 15th so sure you update well it is never good to update to the first beta of a new version but here I don't find anything against not updating of course it is a point 5.5 update which means there won't be any significant changes that could lead to bugs or anything just like a worse performance or worse battery life if you are on the developer profile then yeah just go ahead and update there probably won't be anything wrong at least you'll be running the most recent version of course it might fix some of your bugs and just increase your performance of the device well this is it for iOS 13 point 5 point 5 beta 1 which came after thirteen point five point one the public beta will of course be getting this update soon as well so stay tuned for that also if you are ready for iOS 14 coming in about 20 days then let me know in the comments down below about your favorite leaked creature or about a feature that you'd love to see if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video all so if you missed my previous video then please go ahead click the card shown up there okay take care and I'll see you in my next video you
