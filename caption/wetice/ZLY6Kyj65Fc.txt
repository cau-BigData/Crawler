hello everyone and welcome back to another video I'm holding my camera in my hand at my recording desk today I'm gonna show you around my lights and audio setup but before we do don't forget to leave a like and subscribe if you're excited for this video anyway I've had this question asked multiple times over in my comments to show you how my lights and audio setups work let's take a look we have to start at the start so in the past I used this video rode videomic here to record my audio on top here on my head but now I actually use this little la vie right over here which is way better for videos like this I use the rode video link road link ya type of thing it's a really good microphone I really enjoy using it it's still kind of a pain to set it up but once you got it you are really happy now for the light umm one softbox on the right side and another softbox on the left side and one overhead which I turn on when I'm recording with the camera over there when I'm recording shots overhead doing some iOS videos or anything like that then I turned this one off so there's no reflection right over here just finish the video about iOS this is the setup here now I'm also going to include kind of a setup tour in this video so kind of the camera and all the other accessories that I use all the time to make my videos work we have to move over here so this is where the main section is this is the 6d mark 2 with the road link right here I'm recording on it right now so as you can see there's an audio level bar which is great and then we have an output here kind of like adapter and adapter but leave that be and it goes all the way down to this screen which actually shows me what I'm doing I previously had it over here but it blocked the view of all this and it'll be seen so very annoying and then you might be asking what is this thing right over here well this thing is very simple this is a teleprompter I will talk about this in an upcoming video how this works but basically it mirrors text from my iPad over onto the teleprompters that I can see it right from the other side so I can see it from here all the text it's going and as you can see the camera is just behind it which the camera cannot see very good otherwise I might also use my laptop for other videos if I have scripts here for like the iOS videos and stuff like that so I pretty much use two cameras all the time I use them 60 mark two for my primary camera shooting me and then I use the HDD for overhead shots or for videos like this so I really love these two cameras they work really well now for example here I'm recording on my lab I to my 6d because the setup is actually quite annoying to do and I'd not want to do it on the ATD because I use this one for vlogging as well so I don't want to mess with the settings so that the rode videomic can actually work here with no problems so this is my desk with a chair and here I pretty much put anything Apple related when I film Apple videos you could see that it changes from phones to an Apple Mouse to a jewel the Mac Mini to any other shots like this really like doing this is a new setup for me well this pretty much concludes the setup tour except this grey wall here it's just the wall nothing special about it I wanted to do something cool about it but I'm not gonna tell you why because that's a surprise for later this year anyway this is the end of the video if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and also if you missed my previous video then please click in the corner up here okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
