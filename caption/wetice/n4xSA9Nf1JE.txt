hello everyone and welcome back to another video previously we didn't know much about the Apple watch and we even thought that there might not be a new model however today we received a lot of news about its design and confirmation that it's coming there is a great chance for it to come a report from two days ago by maangchi Kuo gave us some interesting news he says that the Apple watch will not only have an OLED display but that it's coming in the fall of 2019 it is possible for Apple to wait and release the watch a little later but since they've never done it I think it won't happen so we will most likely see the iPhones and the watch on September 10th 2019 during the conference from this report we also figure out that there might be a new model coming this year over on I held BR they discovered leaked images of the setup page found in beta 6 of watch OS 5 you might have noticed that the design doesn't look different but look at the text the first ones is 44 millimeters titanium case there isn't any titanium case currently in the Apple watches and the second one says 44 millimeters ceramic case does that mean that ceramic cases for the Apple watches are coming this year these are the two unreleased Apple watches that Apple has been working on these are only set up images but we have titanium and ceramic cases coming we also have the sizes confirmed now 2018 was a huge jump for Apple as they brought the all screen display and other huge updates they also upgraded the screen sizes from 38 millimeters or 42 millimeters to 40 millimeters or 44 millimeters that sizing should be staying the same this year you will be able to keep all your bands for your Apple watch if the size stays the same which is great now you might be asking why ceramic and titanium well that's simple for people that want a classier watch then ceramic will be great for them the other one will be getting titanium as it is very light metal with a huge resistance force I feel like that is great to make the watch more durable but it might come at a cost well this is all I have for you guys we will have to wait and see until the rumored date of the conference September 10 20 if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here also please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
