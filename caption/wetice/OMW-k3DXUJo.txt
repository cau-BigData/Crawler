hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today today is a different day because today I'm holding the g7x in my hand and today we're going to at least I'm going to answer a question that was asked again on Twitter now that question that was asked was how I record my videos first of all we're going to see where I record my videos the ones that I do at my desk when I'm sitting so I have a screen here that's connected to my computer where my main screen is over here and I just kind of have it here off to the side because there's the wall behind me where as here the wall and some other stuff would be behind me what I don't like and so this would be the kind of shot you would get with the wall behind me except of this desk here what's out of the scene usually because I kind of like I'm raised up a little more on my chair and it's it's just out because I'm more zoomed in so that's that's it so you see the blue wall and in front of me there's the screen so then you might be asking a question what does this screen though well this screen is where I see the main camera what it is recording right over there since the 100d doesn't have a it doesn't have a flip screen so this way I can see what I'm recording so if I look off to the side that's why here I can see what I'm doing and recording and basically here I record what I'm recording so just a small pixie here and I see if I'm still in focus or if it's still recording so what allows me to do that is this HDMI kind of switcheroonie here which just goes all the way down and gets plugged into this screen all right over here so this is not anything that's complex that you cannot do yourself when you don't have a flip screen then one amazing thing is where as you can see I have no batteries I have this camera a battery adapter thingy where basically it provides power right from the plug so I don't need to have batteries so that little thing is runs all the way down like this all the way here and this comes into this mode after thingy will just plug into the plug underneath my desk so that pretty much explains a part one of where and how I record my videos now I have another place where I do my videos what you see when I'm on the unboxing something or making a review so this is it right over here this is what you see whereas my unboxing slash review this same function same adapter what goes into the screen here what I can see from sitting right there as you can see my hand so it works and the same adapter for the power so I have unlimited power and the microphone would I need to put batteries but that's good so then I sit here I see the camera and I see myself up there as you can see let's just see I'm sitting in front of the camera I see myself right up there so it's perfect see if I'm still in focus and if I'm still recording so this would be a great place to end off the video at the desk anyway this is I think not even a desk this is just like some kind of I store stuff in it so and it has two functions actually so it's perfect anyway if you enjoyed this video if I answer this question correctly and if I understood it correctly then let me know in the comment section down below or by leaving a like leave a like and subscribe it's greatly appreciated and I hope to see you in my next video what's on Friday take care and I'll see you next time bye [Applause] [Music] you
