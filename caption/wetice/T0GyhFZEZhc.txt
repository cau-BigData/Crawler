hey guys I'm white-eyes gamer and welcome to something new so this is a vlog type of video so you know I want to say that this video's will be a little special because I'm not going to be like a special type of lover we're basically i'm going to be making lots daily no i'm gonna be making vlogs when I have something to show you guys and something that I feel like giving out to you guys okay so what I'm going to mostly do with the trypsin journey is ok I am going to basically make like this will be like the behind the scenes of the gypsum journey ok so we're going to be basically where I'm going to be walking all day when we go somewhere and then in the evening or next day I'm going to put out the blog and the trypsin journey video will be a separate one ok so that will be a different video so there one two videos one will be kind of the behind the scenes and the other will be the main video ok so then I want to talk about something that I wanted to talk to you for a while now ok so basically one thing first I want to talk about the history of my channel so I started thinking about making you make youtube videos in September 2015 ok you can see that my channel I opened it april eleventh 2016 but I in September and all the rest i was like playing games and i was getting into the microphones and all that things so thanks in April 11 I started my channel and everything so I wanna talk the history of a microphone okay so i started in season one okay this was in season one basically i started with a webcam okay so basically i was recording with this thing ok so this thing basically i put it on and put it on my lamb okay and then I was speaking into this web cam okay I still have this webcam it's a creative webcam you know I was using it just for sound nothing special you know it's normal webcam okay nothing really special right but then the next thing I was using so this was used in season one most of season one okay and then also what I was using in season one towards the like towards the middle or something like that I was using a headset with a microphone now I was not able to find the headset but i found the microphone from the answer so i was using this microphone so those black go ahead said i was using it like this okay this was my microphone before good microphone at that time when i was looking at it and it was I good i looked at the sound because i did not know there are many different microphones out there that i can use the dialogue back okay and then the microphone i use now at my favorite microphone i mean for now I don't know there more microphones that I use the you know there aren't picture but it's this one okay is this microphone you know it's unplug it's a normal microphone cable okay and plugging into a USB so that's great and it's a tone or e3000 microphone so I i love this microphone as well this is the microphone i recorded like most of the episodes on my channel and even all the episodes are record now I recording on this microphone ok so this microphone it is effects small ok and it's it's great it's a beast is microphone I mean I can do so many things with it except on the beginning I had some problems with it where where it was kind of the sounds low or something so what I've done is I install the software what basically makes the microphone like you know it from one hundred percent to four hundred percent so so now the microphone sound is higher and a lot better so that's what I use now and this is my favorite microphone then I have another microphone what is the microphone i'm using now there ok so it's a roadie microphone i had no idea was the model whatever and that's the microphone i'm using now great microphone i think is it equivalent to this microphone i'm pretty sure and it has the sound great like this ok and then on with the microphone i have a camera eos 100d canon camera ok and that camera it recorded all the trips enjoy this video i did not change camera yet but most of the pictures are done by a 450d my second canon camera I like cannons because the lettuces I can be you know swapping them out for whatever can I get so I won't be buying new lenses but this is the camera i use for all the trips and your name's videos because the 450d is not a video camera it's just a photo camera this look into both this one in the photo and video and beautiful pictures you know I know that they are lower models by the OS 70d what I'm planning on getting later on but yes this is a beast and then in my camera collection i have also well you know the webcam over there oh the microphone webcam and then what I have also is a go extreme thing with a recorded yoga time lapse with but that I'm gonna change because it's only 720p and that's I don't like 720p I like 1080p you know so I'm gonna get a 1080p hero for you know go pro not go extreme so yeah that's going to be another camera in my collection so yeah yeah this is it for this vlog i hope you enjoyed this vlog if you did please let me leave a like down below so this was my first vlog i hope you enjoyed it okay so yeah i'll see you in the next episode
