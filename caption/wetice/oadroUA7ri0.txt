uploaded and then it should be up today so I hope you enjoyed this vlog we are going to go through the Vienna christmas market since it's Christmas alright so we have the tickets now and we're going to the Vienna to the Christmas market so that's going to be quite fun I think the train is here we just bought tickets a 1215 okay there's couple stops and the trainees spark like in a weird spot I mean it's cool so let's just get inside the train it's gonna be cool you [Music] [Music] drive to Vienna and train White Hart the seats we're not very very good but we are arrived now we're going to make our way to make sure because want to go christmas markets there are multiple of them I don't know which one yet but we're following some of our tourist guide friends they're not doing tourist guides it's just I just call them like that because I think that's you like that but there's so many people this time and this camera is doing an amazing job of doing everything that's pretty good [Music] alright so now as long as in the metro kind of i don't still know correct way but we're going under down were taking another escalator so I hope the correct way and for me we just came out of the metro we r CH different plots right now so we are good now different puzzle climbing up the stairs now and the people are so well educated here that they stand in one line to go up like the left flank we always empty so that i'm going to show you okay so we are outside there's so many people out here is insane we're near the cathedral so it's it's a beautiful area there's so many tourists so it doesn't even feel like I would be doing something really all for now logging with this camera because there are so many cameras on here doesn't even feel we are Christmas backers right now we found one to two of them there's nothing to what we're trying to do now is eat something because we work go on the road since like 11 12 tracks technically we took the train but I need me to find something to eat but as I said 153 markets already and there's nothing so I think the only thing that will have to do is probably go to the biggest market what we did not want we just finished in the market can eat something and now we're going to like a small coffee place did you have a drink and sit because we've been out since a couple hours now and it's quite tiring i can say so we need to go sit a little bit it's going to be cool we're inside the place now and we had no spots we decided to sit like on this kind of small spots unix the window nothing special but we're going to have something probably and sit here while Stan [Music] okay coffee break over there's no small little cafe nothing really special i hope you enjoy the small speed up i made i'm still learning the camera and you know basically that it's not the best still but yeah and i'm trying i'm shooting in different like perspectives and just trying to do a different kind of thing different things to make these folks good this morning even i tested with 50 frames a second but then i had some problems at youtube so i don't want that too much but 25 frames is just perfect and everything works correctly so now we're about to walk the main market and yet so we'll see what they offer [Music] this looks like a quite nice Street and I honestly it's quite long it's nice and I have some beautiful shots of it so hope you're going to enjoy them and we're like standing just not so long ago in front of like the most like the nicest cafe in Vienna and there was a line so long even around the corner so it was I mean I don't know how we move and stay there but I mean it's the nicest [Music] I don't even know how many horses i have in mind oh yeah already probably a lot of them just passed around me but sounds a ton of horses in my video and I'm getting so used to this all to my public now that I don't even care anymore this is starting to be cool and I think I racket civilly to learn how to fold you care not properly [Music] [Music] the nicest place I ever saw in fact I'm gonna play with some settings on the camera and also from how it changed by a little bit probably some of the images and stuff so hold up i'm gonna play with some setting well we just came out of that area it was a nice area but I played with some settings and I'm not even sure because there's like sunny settings and cloudy settings and all kinds of settings like that but I'm trying to sunny setting since there's some Sun now but at night i'm gonna try the nights and things so it's gonna be pretty cool and i'm gonna mess with them cuz anyway you know that at four it's dark and it's like 330 at now so you know it's gonna be dark soon [Music] haha the only thing I'm going to say about christmas market that the amount of people there are there were no there are like huge lines and you have to be literally like pushing them over because they would not move the people would literally not move they're gonna just stay there glued there and the favorite thing of people probably is it a stand in middle wait for something to happen or wait for someone to tell them to move now we're going to go still all over the in a little bit as you can see it's starting to get dark you know all of the treats all of the nice horizontal starting to light up yellow and all different colors so it's starting to be really nice outside and thing is i still haven't sold a Christmas Jean here outside I need to see that [Music] alrighty some we just went to like a beautiful Street photos just behind us it was really nice and now we just turned over to like a different Street and I don't know where it is we just started walking around we're gonna meet some people and then the train is at 18 15 6 15 so that should be ok I let you just decided to put like a kitchen shots in it I really like the design of the kitchen now we're walking on like a nice today and as I look into the viewfinder non-stop I always see that it would look like if it would be day but it's not as so that's real [Music] you from the others I must've called a bell I to tell you with everything that I've look all you never [Music] I'll give you an update we are now sitting here and just disgusting little bit the train is going to go in exactly like one and a half hour or something like that so we are somewhere in the middle of you and I don't even know where the hell we are and we're going to take the metro again a little later so well we are on our way to back to travel back to go home so we're going to take the travel number number electric be like in our hometown it's like numbers and here is lectures I don't even know but that should take us to let you take us to the train station or we can take the metro there are two options but I don't know which one we're going to take and you know we'll see depends on what we don't get so short tester or something but I think with the microwave to change and with this you don't have to that's why we're taking this kind of public transport ha oh it's pretty cool and we should be home late or something it's only one hour but the NI at night is also very very nice and I really like [Music] at least [Music] sorry breaking your heart [Music] please [Music] alright we are back at the station we are going home we need to see we wait to see which train it is to take home but we are really like hold up I'm gonna check my phone 6 26 34 @ 6 26 when I see and the train leaves at six k 40 something so we are quite like now good we just took the tram and we need to somehow now get somewhere where I don't even know where but map maybe we should check that maybe that should be how we go I have no idea let's just I'm gonna try to go figure out which way we need to go to catch the train maybe that way I still don't know and I'm going to see if if we get even home on time [Music] arrived to the top now we are here on top at the train station I don't think we came to the correct spot still don't we are the correct spot or maybe we are ah but in fact the strain is very short it's only somewhere there but I just want to say this vlog is really fun to make for me and if you enjoy these be sure to leave a like don't worry don't worry I'm not ending this vlog yet I'm ending this vlog when I come home you know this was a Saturday full of fun full of her friends and full of things like that and it's cool now i love these seating areas all over the place you can literally just sit in them and wait clacking their heated or something but we are here vien hope i'm not gonna even say what thick is and veena people i just want to say Austrian people in general they don't comment they just asked about my vlogging stuff and and about all that that they don't care when I'm vlogging or anything and it feels also like that that I don't i'm not i don't feel anything about it and it's all just who they're chill with it but in my country I'm still keeping that a secret they care they just stare at me like what the hell is that guy and why and what and where so yeah [Music] alright so we just arrived to our train station and finally we were standing a whole trench if there were so many people I'm so excited that that basically we made it here without dying in the train I mean I ended up sitting on on the floor and divorced arrogant like what I hell are you doing
