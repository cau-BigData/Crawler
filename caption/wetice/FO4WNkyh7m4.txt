[Music] today I take you through this place this is my new desk tour this is what I edit this is where I work this is where I make all the videos all the pictures and everything this is all happening or right behind me on all this here so let's get into the tour I don't really know where to start but I'm gonna start in this corner of the room this is where I have my production clapper for the production and everything then if I continue lower I mean I have some USB kind of ports here and then a collection of previous iPhones that one's the iPhone 4 that's the iPhone 8 then I have this small kind of collection right here with some speaker system that I'm gonna talk about a little more further some means of course you need mints all the time and then the big screen right over here the biggest necessary most used thing actually out of the whole setup so that's my dog just detail so this is a philips ultra widescreen I think it's 4k as well it's really good for editing and I'm really happy with it then here lower I have some crap like some adapters nothing really special then here I have a really nice cup holder for mugs and stuff and another speaker and here we have Amazon Alexa at all of you already know this is where it's places and then on the same side I have the iPhone 7 plus and the iPhone 8 plus site plus is black and the 7 plus is great so then I have some remotes here so for the air conditioning from the speaker system for the LEDs and my computer glasses here and next to this I have a switch an Ethernet switch and the Philips you thing and it's covered by painters tape or by like by electrical tape because I cannot stand the light at night so if I go a little bit back here is my favorite part of the desk this is the Apple space gray Mouse the Magic Mouse - with the keyboard the keyboard Space Gray with the numeric keypad as well it's really really nice I love it the keystrokes and everything super great I love it and the mouse the gestures even on windows works really well then if I move on to this part of the room it's gonna be up here there is the center speaker that I have here for some reason and then I have kind of like a collection of cameras right over here on the window that's a Philips you lamp so here I pretty much have just the g7x the GoPro Hero 5 just this is the battery pack for the ATD and then a bunch of Gorillapod so the small one different one then 3k and I'm using the 5k on the 6d right now and a Philip you lamp that I have some light here so moving on to this part of the desk this is kind of like the workstation where I do other things then video editing so right over here there's just a Mac Mini that I I think it's a late 2010 or something like that works really well for other kind of work that's really good and then connected to it just a standard Dell screen nothing really special just a 1080p screen and then the keyboard here so this is the Apple magic keyboard 1 and it's really really interesting because it still uses the standard batteries which is kind of old and I have next to it the white Apple Magic Mouse one as well which works on batteries still as well then I have some batteries here that I've charged and some adapters for tripods there and then as the makes sense I have the battery charging station right over here this is where I started must of my batteries so I have two chargers for one is ITT one is 6d they have the both the same battery and this one's for the g7x these are like stuck here mostly so I don't never take these these are just the ones I have at home and then I have like this kind of power cube where I have just plugged a bunch of things and all of that and it's just kind of nicely cable managed and just the light plug there so if we look at it the whole thing it's not big it's just using all the space I can and I really like it so let's just get down to the floor now don't mind all the cables over there so this is the speaker system that I have it's really good it's five speakers works really well and has some quite good audio quality now the cables around here are just a bunch of mess I don't know why I have so many cables and then the thing you've been waiting for is this the computer I find it really cool to look inside at all the parts that there are like the fan up here that makes light and the red fan there and the discs down here in the graphics card should be really really cool and fun experience to watch the computer so this is the computer from the front and the other side is just closed there's nothing there well so I hope that you enjoyed this video if you did wish to leave like down below I hope you enjoyed this setup I've been working on it for a little while now and I changed it around they removed parts of the desk because they used it toward the unboxing station now but you saw the unboxing station previously so you know everything about that now let me know if you enjoyed by leaving a like and if you want me to do more videos like this in the future then subscribe and it's really hot and it's to money to turn on conditioning okay take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
