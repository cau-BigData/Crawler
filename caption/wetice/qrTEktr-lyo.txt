hello everyone and welcome back to another video here we go the rumors and leaks for the Apple watch Series six are slowly starting to come in of course it is really early as this product will be coming next September but before you click away from this video stay they are really really cool we have some details already from credible sources talking about features that make a lot of sense the Apple watch series 5 came with only 2 new features the always-on display and the better GPS tracking I was disappointed as it was very minor which brings me to think that the 20/20 watch will be packed with new features and changes all around compared to this year we will be seeing big upgrades to the screen technology upgrades to water resistance a better processor and a redesigned side button as well as sleep tracking Apple purchased a company that sells accessories for sleep tracking on the Apple watch a few years ago in 2020 it will be probably the year where we will have this in iOS and watch less actually 9 to 5 Mac talked about this in the past already you will get a notification before your bedtime if your battery is low so that you can go charge it and sleep with your watch it is very likely that the headlining feature will be sleep tracking as you can see from this the second big feature to this one is micro LED technology we already know that Apple introduces new display technology to the iPhone and then the same to the Apple watch so it could mean that the iPhone and the watch will have micro LED screens now what does micro LED do it allows for a thinner and wider display that is brighter and consumes less power hopefully Apple can do the same thing they did with the iPhone 11 Pro this year where they basically made many changes to the battery life and many more things by going through the software and tweaking it all over there haven't been any rumors about battery life yet but hopefully battery life will get better as it hasn't for the past few years the Apple watch series 5 can already submerge up to 50 meters compared to the iPhone 11 that can go up to 4 meters for 30 minutes Apple is said to be making the water resistance even better on the Apple watch the side button and the digital crown are said to also become solid state buttons this means that the button will not be actually moving but it will just actually kind of you will just press it and feel like a haptic feedback I already talked about this a long time ago and it didn't happen so maybe 2020 this change would prevent some parts from breaking and it would even become more water resistant so that may be to go to 75 meters or there would be a diving mode but this is all just speculation Apple didn't make the Apple watch Series five any faster or any better with regarding performance they upgraded their processor to the s5 from the s4 but the only addition here was better GPS that's it this was really disappointing but maybe next year on the series 6 we will have better processors so if you want to buy the Apple watch now during the holidays maybe you should consider waiting and buying something else for now the series 6 is already looking really good with sleep tracking a better processor better water resistance maybe better battery life and that's just the top of the iceberg that's nothing if you want to learn more about iOS 13.3 beta 2 then please click the card shown up here also please leave a like and subscribe as it is all greatly appreciated and if you want more videos like these ok take care and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music]
