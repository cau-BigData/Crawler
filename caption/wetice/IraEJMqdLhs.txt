hello everyone and welcome back to another video we have been talking about the March event for quite some time now and today we have some confirmation on a few products that will be coming today source is target you know the American superstore we have confirmation about three products that will be for sure coming the first one is earpods x generation and there is no image now we are left to speculate whether these are the over your headphones or just upgraded air pods their price however is $399 so I highly doubt that these will be the third generation air pods and it is very likely to have the studio earphones that Bloomberg and many other sources have been talking about now you might be like this is fake right well we have an article from nine to five Mac which is a very trusted source that got other screenshots from the system at Target we see not only the new air pods but the new Apple watch bands a new Apple TV and a new iPod touch however the current iPod touch is about $199 so why would it be $399 this might actually be the iPhone se 2 or the iPhone 9 that should be priced at $399 so it looks like a naming mix-up as an iPod Touch for almost $400 would be insane of course as every year we get new Apple watch bands but that's not very exciting out of the news we have the Apple TV X generation that was leaked across the operating system is going to be coming as well it will probably have an a 12 or a 12 X or a 13 processor many people started playing games from the Apple arcade on the Apple TV but the processing power is just not good enough so an updated processor with better graphics for $180 is the way to go of course the current Apple TV 4k is priced at $180 so this generation X Apple TV will most likely be 4k or 4k HDR however we have no pictures and no other details whether it will change on the outside or not another source that actually talked to the employees at Target said that the products are generally added before they are released however the release of these products can be between a week and a month could this be fake well it doesn't look like it because many of the products shown here have been leaked for many months all these products are really exciting but we still have no idea whether the Airports Pro will be over your headphones or just the third generation however $399 for a third generation of air pods is way too much so I think that they will be Apple branded headphones but this is just my speculation so I might not be right the $400 iPod Touch or iPhone se 2 is likely on the way but now I am just confused which one could it be the iPod Touch with like giant upgrades or something or could it be the iPhone se 2 which we have been hearing about for a long time with a 4.7 inch screen with a better processor in the shell of the iPhone 8 with touch ID etc well let me know what you think about all of this in the comments down below if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to know when I release a new video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I will see you in my next video [Music] you [Music]
