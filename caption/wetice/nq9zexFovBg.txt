hey guys and welcome back to another video today today we are going to be unboxing the canon g7x this one died a couple days ago just before leaving to Zanzibar so yeah I got a new one and I never did an unboxing video so here it is I'm really excited with this camera because this is a really good camera and it's not the quality that made it die it's just me dover using it and stuff I mean it was my go-to camera the whole time I don't know what happened but it's not under warranty anymore so I could not do anything so as you can see here this is the powershot g7x mark ii it's the same as this one so let's see inside i completely forgot what was inside but let's see alright this opens nicely and inside you have oh that's what is this the warranty okay that's all that your manual your standard manual from every camera it's useless and here it is so i'll have two charges now i guess so you get the power cable with the official charger to charge the batteries so these that's the charger then this is useless you get a small kind of strap thing you get one battery very generous from canon and at last you have the g7x here it is this is the camera you probably saw it many times in my videos but it's just all fresh brand new if you see that I don't think there's a difference there's probably no difference I just wanna which one is dead but this one you see the screen is all banged up on the sides and everything so it was really used I really loved the g7x as the go to vlogging camera because it just does everything it goes in your pocket it does absolutely anything you want but I'm gonna talk about it in more detail in the future wow this one's not even shiny anymore so I'll talk about it more in the future some upcoming videos about the camera because it's great as a camera and I really enjoyed the biggest factors are like the autofocus and all everything that you have on it the manual mode is not even bad for a compact camera so that's really really good and and it just has this flip screen alright the lens is really really good and and just everything in the camera makes it such a good go-to camera if you're going somewhere where they don't allow big DSLRs or something like that or they allow just you to sneak in with a camera so this just goes in your pocket wherever in your purse you mean anywhere you want to put this camera it's gonna fit instead of carrying this big DSLR that I have here so that's a really big positive and the also the audio is really good because it has a good microphone for vlogging so I'm not complaining about anything of course it doesn't have such a good microphone as a big DSLR with a big microphone on but it does the job when you're outside and when you're traveling and when you need a camera which you can rely on that's tiny alright guys so this is it for this video so if you enjoyed visually like down below and subscribe for more videos and wish me like that this one will not fail in two years but it will survive a longer time but yeah all right take care I'm for me like subscribe I'll see you next time with actually as ads of our video next time alright bye [Music] you [Music]
