hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some new Iowa's 13 concepts that were made by Iran cuz II hope I'm not saying that wrongly all I have to say is that they are amazing but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's get into these concepts that would really bring life to iOS starting off he presented us with this amazing home screen which would be completely redesigned with that Iran showed us that there could potentially be widgets which would be fully customizable but on the other hand it would look too much like Android then the Settings app has an amazing new design with better menus for connectivity options and Wi-Fi however this one looks really far-fetched as this would require a ton of work so realistically speaking we may see a redesign but not to this extent for now it could come in the future messages such iMessages should be redesigned as well we should be seeing a similar design to the Settings app but this concept is more believable here than in the Settings app completely doable we could see that the control center in this concept didn't get such a big redesign it pretty much looks very similar to what we already have so I would hope to see something more like this for example it could have Advanced Options or something like that along those lines we cool as you know there is a lot of talk about the volume HUD Apple is said to do something with it and this concept shows what it may look like however I don't really like this specific one as it looks too big I prefer the ones we have been seeing that are a little bit smaller with a smaller volume HUD comes a smaller call system every time someone would call you you would see it in a small window on your screen or just small pop it would show up on the top and then you could move it around so that you can do something else while you're calling this is something I would love to see and it would bring a lot of multitasking for those people who use Apple music often there could be an app redesign I really like this redesign and it would bring more to the app if you know as I mean Syria would also get an update we could be seeing a less intrusive Siri interface in different forms when you would say the trigger words there would be a small UI on top whereas if you press the button to activate there would be a bigger UI this would be really cool as it would make it less intrusive and bring some change into iOS finally the feature that pretty much everyone has been waiting for and is confirmed dark mode he made a really cool concept that I really enjoy seeing even though he did not add as many details as some other sources we've been seeing but still something cool to see that it's actually coming well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today but let me know what you think about these changes and what are some features you would love to see also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I will see you in the next one but [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
