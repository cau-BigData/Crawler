hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to talk more on the huawei mate 20x as I've had some comments about gaming and media on this phone so gaming some games are gonna talk about that then media meaning like movies pictures how the screen size is how it all works together to make an amazing experience so starting off with gaming I've recently just started looking into some games on this phone I've played some car games I've played some just like not really Hardware intense games and I can say that it performs really really well the cooling of the phone for games is really important and this phone has amazing cooling all around so it doesn't really get too hot in my opinion even though I don't know what kind of games you play but I wasn't really playing some hardware intensive games but that'll be cool to test out and if you can let me know how some hardware intense games are doing in the comments down below overall my gaming experience frame rate and so on even though I'm not such a big gamer I'm gonna talk about a casual gamer user experience type of thing it feels great you have a big screen so you can play really good games you have stereo sound on both sides so it gives you a really cool experience when gaming you have sound from both sides you can really get into the gaming experience there's no lag or stutter on the games I played I really really enjoy also the augmented reality thing there are some games with augmented reality the camera works really well with that it can be a lot of fun especially if you play with friends and also the artificial intelligence that's in it that's just like a side note media so that's what I do mostly on my phone so media considering Instagram Twitter YouTube some movies and pictures and videos that I make let's start with the size of the screen because this is pretty important here if you go into your gallery then you have your pictures and I recently made a vlog and I talked about that but you have such a cool experience when looking at the pictures so you really get an amazing image on the screen you can really zoom in and if you zoom into the whole phone you see this amazing edge to edge image which is really something that I never thought I could do and the size of this phone just makes it a lot easier to really zoom in and get into many of the details that are there and you can really see how much the camera actually does add the 40 megapixels then the same thing applies to videos pretty much the same thing if you're playing back videos you have that stereo sound and it just works really well and it's really enjoyable overall then if we look at YouTube it's ginormous so YouTube videos can be watched at a super high resolution and on this phone you can really see clearly what's going on which is something I really enjoy doing so let's say my video look how big it is on this phone it's really cool you can really really enjoy the video to the fullest from this phone so that's something really incredible and not only my videos but you can really go on and watch movies and things like that which make it a great experience now browsing Instagram same thing ginormous screen you can really look at the images it has a great color everything is just so big you can really scroll through many comments at once you can read them on the full screen which gives you a lot more reading space and they're a lot bigger so for those that don't have a really good vision and need glasses for your phone for example if it's small that I would recommend this one it's not at a high price but you can really see perfectly perfectly what's written so that's something really cool to look at and now Twitter pretty much the same thing with the writing when you are logged in of course I'm not but you can really see the tweets clearly you have the like button and so on it's a totally different experience and for those that want a big screen so that I can see big images like me when looking at photos that I take with this phone or videos it's a great experience even if you want to just watch a movie with your friends at least you have a big screen and you're not all crowded around this tiny screen so great for many different uses well this is pretty much the end of the video I hope you liked it leave suggestions in the comments on what I should do with this phone and what I should test with it it'll be all greatly appreciated and I'll get to it as soon as I can anyway please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated just do that it helps me out a lot and yeah take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
