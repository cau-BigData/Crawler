hello everybody and welcome back to another video so in the past I recorded some videos about iOS 12 and today I'm going to answer the question do I like iOS 12 so iOS 11 I said I loved it but at the beginning it was really good but then really really many bugs came to light and I was 12 fixed that so many bugs on iOS 11 were fixed with iOS 12 which is really really good because now we don't have many stupid bugs but what they noticed so far in the betas but they're only betas is that there are still many many bugs and many bugs that are brought with I was 12 so I mean they fixed iOS 11 bugs but the iOS 12 bucks from the new features are there again so hopefully in the betas that will be coming through the month of July and August and September will fix many of those problems and bugs and it will be just like a stable great iOS 12 the to just replace I was 11 fully in at the end of September so yes I love iOS 12 all the new features it really makes it a better place it makes it easier to use it makes the lot faster so in all of these aspects I love it a lot so I mean if I should say like a one big whole roundup thing is that iOS 12 is a really good update you should update and maybe even get a beta but you should wait for the final release because there are still many bugs that need to be fixed and many problems that are sometimes even crashing your phone like one bug that I found is that it randomly puts like app limits by itself and then just crashed your phone so you need to restart so it's like a bug that should be fixed by the end of September when official release will come so I mean yes there are bugs I would not recommend to update right now when the bait that just came out but you should rather wait for the final release to just get a really stable version but if you're like me and you love testing and seeing how the iOS develops and how it goes through all of its stages then the beta is a good place to start you can really see many you can really get you can see all the bugs that are there how they are fixed and and you just get to experience something that's not many people experience if you just wait for the final release so it's really interesting and if you're in the beta software like group the profile then you also get updates throughout the year even when it's out with all the new beta versions that they're testing out so it's really interesting if you want to see on all the new features in the all the new bugs they fix in in advance but it can bring risks such as having the bugs yourself and just be stuck with bugs and wait to the next beta version or the next version so I mean just keep in mind these things but back to the question do I like I always twelve I love it I really love it I really do all the updates that came are really good I would like to try the an emoji that emojis but I don't have an iPhone X so I cannot try that but all the other features my favorite one is the bedtime mode where no notifications come that's like amazing that's like the favorite thing ever group notifications are also my second favorite thing they really save you a lot of the scrolling on the main screen just to find that you have five hundred not occations from Twitter 100 from Instagram and 10 emails or whatever so it saves your life just to have notifications and to be able to just get rid of them quickly so yeah I love iOS 12 there are so many features that are really good excellent and help save time and also with Siri suggestions you save a lot of time and you can customize Siri a lot more than before and also she suggests some apps that you should cancel notifications on which helped a lot so I mean I love it I have no problem so far except many bugs that are there but I bet that that to be resolved within the next beta releases and it's just going to be all fine and dandy alright but this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed this video be still live like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future so if you want to talk about more of these more of these kind of things and let me know in the comments section or just people I can subscribe and let's grow okay take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you [Music]
