hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12 point for developer beta 2 out for the developers but everyone who's in the public beta can go and get it now as it is available for the public as well this update comes just 5 days after the release of beta 1 and I'd like to talk about it as it is very interesting but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and it helps me out a lot now let's go and look at this beta now this is a very small update at about 80 megabytes and now I'd like to show you why that is so if we go into the settings we go into general and about and we go take a look at software version we tap on 12.4 and we can see that we are running 16 g50 27 eye and the eye is very important at the end in the past we would have G at the end this is the same build number as in beta 1 but we have an eye instead of a G G being a very unstable version so I is a little more stable than G now what does this tell us well something probably went really wrong in beta 1 so they had to make another release very soon and usually there's 2 weeks between releases but as you can see it's been only 5 days it must have been an emergency fix however we don't know what it could have been there were no FaceTime bugs or any bugs in general reported however there are some things that I'd like to show you in beta 2 that I forgot to look at in beta 1 when you'd open up your wallet app this would be the launch screen you'd get which is new and this card right over here is most likely the Apple card that's coming this summer so that's really nice and this was pretty much the main reason for 12.4 to get devices ready for the apple cart now another thing that I noticed in 12.4 are the animations when doing anything there are smoother system-wide and a lot better after five days abuse I also noticed many speed upgrades on this phone but the most visible change is on the animation when unlocking your phone so let's take a look boom the animations a lot different for me at least it unlocks faster compared to twelve point three and also this exact animation works the same way in your app store as it would on unlocking your phone so these are some performance enhancements it can be pretty much because this will be the last update out of iOS 12 there's a little bug in iMessage so if I would just start typing so if I would type love for example so this bug doesn't happen on all the devices but if you look closely over here so I typed love and it suggests emojis now it's on a phone basis it doesn't say on which phones this is going to happen but sometimes some people report that these suggestions would not show up and it do just show suggestions of words which is something that we didn't see in the past another thing is a bug in your messages so if you'd go this and hide others it wouldn't work in beta one however now it works which is great also do not disturb mode wouldn't be working really well in beta one but that's fixed now as well so it is good to see Apple fixing small bugs like these even though I think there was a way more bigger reason why this beta came so soon overall performance is very good battery life hasn't been really good for me in beta 1 but now in beta 2 it's a lot better if we go into battery on the phone we're going to see that I use my phone quite a little bit and the battery life has been really good so far it seems to be as good as in iOS 12.3 well this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed if you did please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out a lot and also let me know in the comments down below how I was 12.4 beta 2 is doing for you and if you have any issue or any bugs I'd love to know okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
