hello guys welcome back to another video today we are in a different setting because we are in New York City right now for a week and I just wanted to record this video here so today Sunday I don't know how the time works in Europe anymore but today I wanted to talk about a topic of pre recording videos which is something that happens to every youtuber and someone who's making videos online when they travel or when they go somewhere abroad where they cannot really your record videos or they have to be a sketch on a schedule that's a little bit different so here actually this time I did not pre record any single video so I am just recording videos here and today's video is just before Christmas and I'm super excited for that but um I just let's just get back to the topic of pre recording so pre recording is something just really annoying for me to do because I don't just like making it a videos because then they're not recent and they're just not proper if you get what I mean so I need to always kind of make videos that are recent and just kind of like real life not videos that are a week or two weeks or three weeks old so that's just my personal experience on that but there are many people who prefer pre recording and being in advance a couple weeks so they have something to fall on this is the first time that I actually did not pre record videos for this New York City trip because usually I pre record videos for actually the whole summer for example but that's something I don't really like doing and next summer I'll probably not do but pre recording is really horrible for me and my feelings on it is that you just have to force yourself to make videos in advance that may or may not be Rison and for example if some kind of Iowa's new release comes out I want to talk about it but I already have pre-recorded video so it's kind of like a nightmare to do and it's it's really complicated to pre-record and even if you're a such schedule of like three videos a week for summer for two months it makes about 30 videos which is a massive amount for such a short period of time and it requires a lot of time beforehand and it's just and also the quality of the videos are not as good so the video they're not as good as the ones that are made recently because I can put more time into them and more energy than if I'm making five videos in a day that's just the whole point pre-recorded videos are not as good as videos that are made like within the same week and posted couple days after that's the videos I have time to be made and it's not like you're forcing yourself to make many videos in a day because that makes it horrible however now I regret not pre recording because I'm kind of sick and it's kind of horrible with my voice right now but honestly it's good it's fine I'm really happy enough pre-record actually um it could have been better but it's fine everything is fine actually and New York City is wonderful it's actually dark right now so I cannot show you anything but great vlogs are coming soon and yeah this room is actually gorgeous as well but anyway back to the pre recording I'm kind of getting off track the final verdict pre recording videos is for me the worst thing to do ever I hate to do it it's not fun it requires a lot of Simon advance and the videos are not good and yeah too much work and ones too little effort into the videos that's all I can say but everyone it's there is to like the videos or not but yeah okay well anyway this is the other video so if you enjoyed it be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video okay yeah well bye [Music] you
