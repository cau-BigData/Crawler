hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're going to talk about the whoo-wee mates 20x one more time and look at the camera on the back but no we're not talking about photos this time we're talking about videos now if you're like me you really like making videos and you probably ask the question why can I just have a phone in my pocket and record videos instead of carrying a hefty camera now the May 20 X has three cameras on the back it comes with lekha cameras one being at 40 megapixels one being an 8 megapixels and the third one in 20 megapixels they all do different things the front camera is also in 24 megapixels which must be great and can replace the g7x by megapixels but today we're gonna answer the question can it actually replace it today I'll be comparing this phone with the iPhone X s to see which one would be better for a pocket vlogging camera but if you're excited for this video then leave a like and subscribe all greatly appreciated now let's get into this video for video mode you have actually only two choices on the phone you have the regular video the pro mode and some different options like time-lapse slow-motion and we're gonna get into all of those now the regular mode is fully automatic the only thing you can do is adjust the beauty level and some different effects for your videos the pro mode is pretty much where you can unleash air creativity well at least that's what I thought however in video mode you adjust only a couple settings now don't get sad yet you can adjust the exposure you can adjust the focus even though would you really like to manually focus on a smartphone doesn't really make sense in video but you can do that you can adjust the white balance for cloudy days sunny days different lights scenes that you can have and you can also change the colors and some different things in the settings however the sad thing is here that you cannot actually change much so just stick with Auto I guess because you can pretty much you cannot even change the ISO which is stupid and then you have the more menu where you can find slow-motion time-lapse and a bunch of other options that already mentioned as you can see there are a few options here and you can do quite a lot with this phone actually keep in mind that the iPhone excess has its cameras on the back at 12 megapixels versus who always 40 megapixel main camera on the back it's a big difference the front camera however on the iPhone X s is at 7 megapixels and who always at 24 so big difference again you should also know that the iPhone XS can make videos at 4k but who we can only make it at 1080p full-hd that's something to keep in mind however we will be doing all these tests on both having 1080p regular now I would like to show you a few videos from the camera all right here we are in regular how do you like the quality of the video now the next thing for content creators is sometimes adding slow-motion to your videos now we have some trouble actually here between the two phones keep in mind that the higher the framerate the slower the video is the iPhone can go up to 1080p at 240 frames per second versus rural way at 720p at 212 40 frames per second as you can see you're losing quality on the iPhone you have 1080p HD at 120 frames per second whereas Huawei is a 1080p full-hd at 120 frames per second so there's differences in both of them now look at these two slow motion side-by-side of the same subject and let me know what you think about it in the comments down below the third thing you will be using our time lapses now here are the time lapses side by side of the same thing on the Huawei my 20x and the iPhone 6s the iPhone accessory at 1080p vs. who was shooting at 720p as Huawei cannot do time lapses at 1080p now in my opinion right over here I can say that the iPhones time lapse is way better because it keeps a constant light level versus Huawei changing the light level constantly but I would like to hear what you think about it in the comments down below how about videos using the front camera let's try that we will be using regular mode with both being at 1080p but keep in mind that Huawei has a 24 megapixel front camera and the iPhone has a 7 megapixel camera but let's go look at this here we go I'm talking to the Huawei phone now um it seems a really good I'm clear actually really natural colors and now when looking at the iPhone it seems a little bit greyish in my opinion like compare it with always way nicer in video mode front-facing battery night at least that's what I think but let me know in the comments well we've reached a final verdict which one is better here that's actually gonna be tough but let's start with the audio I listen to the audio really carefully and I feel like the iPhone is dealing way better with the wind than the huawei mate 20x however the overall sound of the device is better on the Huawei so out of this it's more like a 50/50 because one deals better with windy conditions which is great as a vlogger but has worse audio versus one having horrible wind projection and better audio so it depends what you like slight I cannot really make a choice here however on video the video is really really good on the iPhone and on the who away on the whole way from the back camera it looks really natural versus iPhones looking like a really vivid but then it switches when you go to the front-facing camera when the front-facing camera on the iPhone was and look grayish but on the whole way may 20x it looked vivid so which side of the camera should you use if you want a vlog I would recommend the who away well what's my final verdict out of all of this well functionality is pretty much the same however this one has a better camera you can adjust a few settings whereas here you can talk to adjust any setting but then when you're shooting like a video of a dog or a plant or something in front of you then the iPhones way better but if you're a vlogger and you have to see yourself which is today's question I would recommend the Huawei main 20x well this is the end of the video so let me know what you think about the Huawei and iPhone accessories for vlogging based on this video leave a like and subscribe it's greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
