what's up guys are you ready for an emotional roller coaster yeah i'm not but that is going to be today's video you know how much we talked about the 14-inch macbook pro well it's not going to be coming this year and to make things even worse you might not get earphones in the box with your new iphone 12 but on the good side of things we have so many details including the price the features and the name of the upcoming apple glasses starting with the macbook pro and the bad news a few weeks back apple released the new 13-inch macbook pro which was definitely disappointing if you remember there were no changes coming from the previous one at least on the base model but we were all expecting the 14 inch screen now we know why it's not coming or didn't come the 14 inch macbook pro is delayed and won't be coming this year but rather sometime in 2021 so you can see how disappointing it is not to have a new macbook pro with slimmer bezels a better microphone and better speakers as well as many improvements that we saw on the 16 inch next up the iphone 12 might not ship with the earphones in the box and you might be like this is obviously fake well it is not it is from a very trusted source menchiko but it goes very well with what apple said they are supposed to have a promotion on the airpods later this year which could effectively mean that there won't be earphones in the box alright on to the good stuff i believe two weeks ago apple ran out of stock for the homepod and now almost every store out there is running discounts so it might mean that a new homepod could be released anytime now but a safe bet would be during wwdc in just under a month from now now for the best part of this video the apple glasses we have all the details about the features the price the name and everything else from john prosser this is usually very weird hearing about a product that should not be released until at least 2021 so starting off they will look like regular glasses and will start at 499 it is said that they will have two screens one for each eye and they will augment everything around you previous glasses from google had cameras which for many people including me would pose a privacy issue but apple won't be putting one and apple is said to be using the lighter technology in those glasses of course they will have an included stand that will charge them wirelessly however it is going to be interesting to see how apple put so much technology into glasses while keeping them light and comfortable to wear so i am still a little skeptical on how these will actually become reality and they should be called apple glass that's that's it all right that's all we know but when should we be seeing them john proster is saying that they could be announced as soon as this fall fall of 2020 or during an event in the first quarter of 2021 but adding to the confusion mark german with an extremely good track record is saying that these aren't anywhere near being released at least not this year or next year he's saying they won't launch until 2022 or 2023 further saying that john prosser mixed up the apple ar and vr headset with these classes the ar and vr headsets are coming before those glasses so there might be a mix up here well if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when i release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here or see some of the videos in the description below okay take care and i'll see you in my next video [Music] you
