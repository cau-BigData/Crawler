hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you lets me know again in the comments I'm fine as always well I'm not always fine but when I record it makes me energetic and it makes me want to record and yeah look okay whatever I'll explain later but today we're going to look at the most ridiculous jobs you never knew existed so that's going to be quite funny and hopefully it's going to be quite interesting and ridiculous stand-in bridesmaid what does that good enough what's that what is that right just in case your best friend falls out on one of the most important at the dock and organs are filled days of your life you can now hire someone to fill their shoes your new bridesmaid will do everything you need from holding your train scratching your bouquet okay interesting so that's what these are for I hope you understand base travel agent seriously so like a travel agents but for space so if you're tired of traveling the same sunny climes on the same sunny planet why not consider a holiday to space oh so he basically the space ages looks a trip to stay for you and you can go for a vacation to space what who comes to probably craft out of money but you have vacation in space but could be quite awesome in one way also cheap biscuit dunker so I did not really understand what's going on here well you can doesn't evil right here but just ignore that for now yep ignore that so they are basically you know when you have that drastic moment where a cookie drops in like your coffee or tea or something well so they hired some biscuit dunkers and you're testing their strength and endurance so I don't know better testing the cookie that's probably the me being stupid again but just saying Eric all professional apologize there that's a job actually what I'm quite surprised well let's not talk about that so no one but I want to greet back saying sorry is up and shrinking awkward and you have to admit that you were wrong that's actually Sherwin here what's what's going on with my hair there we go okay so basically you can hire a guy who's going or guy or girl who's going to basically take all the blame author and she's going to apologize to someone instead of you and she's going to take all day so actually that's going to be good for you to really shine and if you did something really bad well it is something really bad you should actually go yourself but if you're just not able then just hire professional apologizing and you'll be fine and then the person will thank you for not even being able to apologize to her or him dog surfing instructor so why serve the Waynesville waves alone when you can do it with a man's best friend so is this like a job that you teach dogs how to serve so probably you just sit all day on your motorboat and you teach dogs how to serve but I don't think it's very pleasant for the dogs to serve since I think this one is quite scared already and I don't think I think he went through a lot of pain during the making of this picture so I don't think that's very good for the pets so I would not recommend this kind of color accident exist wow you can actually huh you can cuddle sadness all day that must be so sweet and so much fun but like all the not be sauce it is like caring like a small little bear and just cuddling him oh my god does not be there's not be a great job for you if you like bet that if you like cuddling and if you're not allergic to fur so that's a great job for you should consider Carrie consider a career change along that but anyway guys just include for this video if you enjoyed you should leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this it would be greatly appreciated and take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] maybe [Music]
