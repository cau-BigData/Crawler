hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're going to talk about Iowa's 13 beta 2 and my experience with it all together so I've had I was 13 since the release during WWDC 2019 which was on June 3rd I've had it since then I'm super happy with it overall it is a lot less buggy than previously as in iOS 12 betas after the developer conference now it is great I've had beta 2 on my iPhone for a couple days now and I just want to say something battery life in beta 1 was horrific I couldn't go through the whole day and now I am going through more than a day which I I just don't understand so like I charged my phone last afternoon so yesterday afternoon we're currently today afternoon right well I am at 68% that's pretty incredible for me and it's like maybe I didn't use my phone as much for this past day but overall since I installed beta 2 it has been a lot better I can go through the whole day and still have about 20% at the end of the day 20-30 percent at the end of the day which is incredible which is a lot better than an iOS 12 in my opinion at least for my use on my iPhone XS so that may vary on which device you have now performance wise it is very fast it is a lot faster than iOS 12 in my opinion the animations are a lot better a lot clearer and a lot faster as well now animation wise yeah there are some bugs still some things crash some things just do weird things but overall it is very clean for a developer beta and so early in the development process now feature wise feature wise I love it so it has incredible new features in pretty much almost all the apps there's new things everywhere which brings a new touch to it so it is in your boring phone it's really clear I started using reminders more often now that's one of my favorite apps now the reminder app you can really schedule where you can really see your scheduled reminders you can really see your reminders for today very clearly and you can see all of your reminders just like this it is incredible to see all this in such a good interface and that's only the one of the few things and of course I love dark mode that's something I love so so much in the evening when you're on your phone and you just don't want to have this bright white light staring into your face you can have dark mode which makes it amazing so really I am super happy overall even the Photos app for example I love it it is incredible the new machine learning that it shows you the pictures that you love and so on that's an incredible experience so my two-week plus experience is amazing I am really happy that this beta works really well I didn't have to reinstall my phone or anything or erase anything it works perfectly well if you enjoyed this video and you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here but before you do please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
