hello and welcome back to another video so the wall seems different-colored now because I'm using the g7x for the first time in forever now because I'm going to show you and give you a tour off the unboxing station and recording station where I record all of my videos so let's get into it right now I cannot undo but I mean this is just like a big plain wall that's all it is there's just like a shelf right over here but we don't care about that but it's just like why there's just like a huge Caribbean blue that's what they call it and I really like it on the videos so this is where I'm looking so this is the table this is just white paper it's just stuck on a black desk that's pretty much everything and then I have SD cards here my phone google whole mini there just a knife or in boxing some lens caps then we have this one light second light this is the main camera here this is the 6d mark - we have a lens here that is the 16 to 35 4 and we have a rode videomic on top and that's the screen I'm looking at so like the blue looks completely different than on the g7 X which is really cool and then I just have a standard tripod here and that's pretty much it for the camera so view from here just a blue wall a chair the desk the - and or lamps and the camera there now if we move on top here is the Canon a TD and that serves as a camera that looks down like this when I'm unboxing something and I can see it in the viewfinder right over there so pretty much everything works well there's no carrot card camera now now as you can see this railing this is actually a microphone mount and this like long pole here that means the two poles here these are from the set of like a back screen with like different things and I just use it it's like a homemade thing really this is a microphone mount and that's pretty much for everything here now on top you will see another lab it's another end or lamp and it's actually on this kind of stick and this is also homemade so this is also home a this is a fire extinguisher at the end a pole yep a pole with another and or lamp these lamps are really cool you know why they're really cool because if you look at the back that's what really cool you have the five different do you have five light bulbs inside and each of them they do like a different light on the wall so that's why they're really really cool so as you can see this is the view from the camera and that's where I'll be sitting when I'm recording that's the camera I know it's also on top there it's actually from Joby Gorillapod with a screw so that's what's holding the camera I hope it never falls and then if we move all the way down here to like the mess just the blue carpet for sound and just like the plug there's like HDMI cables for what I have a screen there and just like the plug and all the lamps plug there and then if we move around here you see you have the Google home mini there and just flick from the side here nothing different right and then just like the main power cable going here where I can plug some other things so that's the whole setup very simple right except I'm kind of concerned about the fire extinguisher but it's also serves a nice purpose whenever it would be if higher helped not but thus it is the whole world just run around one more time and you can see so it's pretty much everything all right but if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future I did not use the juice of an X for a while and now I'm going to 60 so tell me what you think about the quality and tell me what you think about this setup I really like it it works really well and I'll see you next time leave a like subscribe I'll see you next time in another video ok good bye bye [Music]
