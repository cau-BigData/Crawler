alright hey guys how are you today today is another great day to record a video because today I'm going to show you something different I did this previously with the 100d so today we are going to do kind of part 1 of reviewing this camera and I'm going to concentrate on the manual settings of the 60 camera now also give some samples of pictures that I have previously taken so you can see what this camera can make but now I'm just going to show you all of the buttons and what they do on the camera alright so let's start this side of the camera so you have all these buttons let's concentrate on these so if the autofocus button which pops up on the screen where you can choose which one you want the one shot a out nai server autofocus then you have the drive button which is only available in the photo mode because what it does it has a single shooting you know high-speed and all the remote control and timer so you can choose that using the the wheel button and that's used for almost everything here then if you click on the other button what's the ISO button you know what ISO means you just that's the light level so you just scroll that with the scroll but that I show you then to apply you just click it again then you have this one what's the metering you click on that and it shows you the metering then you have the light bulb kind of as you can see the screen turns yellow that's at night that you see all these parameters over here then the button all the way up here next to the scroll wheel it's the auto focus auto selection so on the screen you're going to see you can have like all the different types you can even click with your finger and as you can see you just can scroll through them to have that now the same button is actually over here so it's just like with your thumb you can click it easily or with your finger up here then you have the auto focus on button which you can turn it on and off so that's really good then to change the exposure it's just this scrolling wheel over here and as you can see the number changes here when I'm scrolling through that so if I would select I so as you can see the I so it's just and I can be moving this and you see that the number goes up on the screen and then I just apply it by clicking I so again so here you can see everything you have even how many factors you can take until the battery runs out so that's really good now if I get into more detail about the I saw on the ISO range on this camera in pictures can go all the way to 40,000 but if you're in the video mode then your ISO can be only two twenty-five thousand six hundred so that's your range that you have okay so basically also this camera is really great for night photography and for day photography so both of those so I'm going to just give you some example pictures of night photography now I'm going to give you some examples of some day photography or some Sun or whatever you can look at that I put the ISO ranges with it so if you want to go and look back at them you can look at that and see the differences now most of them are not even shot at very high ISO range is not even at the forty thousand so that's just something to keep in mind it's really great it's a really good camera and I really recommend it for shooting all kinds of pictures and videos especially because that's what I do it has the flip screen what I really like but I'm gonna get into that in the part whatever it comes after this talking more about the camera but this one is it I hope you enjoyed this video if you did be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and stay tuned for another part explaining another part of the camera so this is going to be some kind of mini-series okay take care and I'll see you in my next video
