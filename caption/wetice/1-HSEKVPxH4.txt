hey guys and welcome to another episode but this episode is kind of more like a tutorial and as you can see we are in creative we are not on our survival we're not in our modded SMP but today i'm going to show you from our model SMP that you can see the harvester system we have there because maybe some of your interested in that so today i am going to show you how that works so I measured my holes you just for the study that don't have to be doing on camera and I'm gonna put the harvester you can s first see that I'm putting the harvester the other way around because if you put it like this it faces this way so I put it like that and it faces that way then the next thing you want to put is your planter just put that there like that one deep in the ground and like this I dig this out that you can see what's going on then you can remove your temporary block and you want to go with your power pipes over like this and also connect it down to the planter the next thing you want to do is to put your your sludge so I'm going to know first put your first chest where all the items will go from the from the harvester and then you take the sludge out through here and for the sake of this tutorial I'm going to put the sludge boiler right over there because you can carry it wherever you want just one caution it poisons you so I would put it somewhere else then you want your overflow chests maybe somewhere here and you take your your item duct and you can connect now this so see connected and you want to put also an extractor over here to extract the items from an ignored from the sludge boiler okay now you want to connect the harvester all over the place so you want to put your item duct on the bottom with a servo that is on black list four o clock because you don't want oak log and ignore it so you don't want all clocks going into your planter then you take you don't want to connect that then you take it and you can run it however you want wherever you want where your plan trees and you connect it to the planter like so then you want to make a security system on this because the overflow once this fills up with saplings the saplings will be just running in this pipe and it can crash your server so what you want to do maybe for easier way I am going to dig around a little more here we're going to reconnect this pipe like so and then you have another one coming out and you have a bloops you have a blue servo the input servo over like this what is on white list with a sapling so again you have white list there then the rest of the saplings that are outgoing you just take them just take them around and you can connect them not like slowly you just connect them to your overflow chest we're also your sludge items what are created go so that's connected like so then next thing you want to do is on this chest on top where does the would go you want to put your item duct and go wherever you want except there's also a security system for it so you're going to put a servo an extractor and you're going to put white list for wood and you're going to enable written control low for this design if you want it then you're going to carry this a little bit and you're gonna put a chest over here that's where your wood will go and now to go look at the security system so the security system is requiring a little bit of stuff you just want some some comparators some repeaters some redstone dust a hopper and some shovels so you're going to take from up here we're going to take a block and I'm going to connect it up here so we're going to take a block there and I have a screenshot next to me so sorry if I if I'm doing it a little slowly and you go like that for now this is a temporary block you don't need it there and you put a repeater over there with your redstone going like this then you turn over here a couple of blocks one two three like so and you go like this with your redstone then the next thing you do is you have to also go over here so you can put your repeater already there and then the next thing here you want to put another block and you want a repeat you're facing that way no texts no nothing and you go one more behind it oops one more behind it with your redstone and then you basically turn this couple of blocks like that and then you go up with the Redstone Excel or maybe we know we go one more block out because that would be a little safer for us and we put redstone again and we come up like so with the red stone there we go and here you turn over like that and you put the comparator facing out of the chest like so and you put another one facing like like so like that sorry for that and then you put another block with a hopper and for shovels one two three and four shovels in the upper and three years lag like if you have many hoppers you do that but if you want if you want to reduce like also you can just put a block on top of the hopper because it's is trying to take items and it can like sometime your game so then finally here we finish this up you put two more blocks over here of redstone whoops of redstone and then you come to the here with repeater connected with a piece of dust and now we are done so now you have your security system that when this chest is eighty percent for the system will kick on and it will stop the chest and the harvester from cutting so they harvested from cutting and the chest from extracting the wood so now let's test it out so we'll put a power bank for now that we have some power and I'm going to just connect it right there and now all of them should fill with power but ok and now you put your saplings in the planter and you see here also i forgot whoops sorry for that that we have no power to the sludge boiler so now we also have to program their the cell what you never know what site is what because maybe this one because there's no really any faces on this so now okay now it extract and how each machines should have power yes and now if we put saplings in this it should plant it all over us except one more thing as you can see it blends in a three by three only so if you want to extend it you need to take an upgrade the copper upgrade and you put one here and also one over in the harvester that they harvest the same thing so as you can see now the whole area is planted with saplings and to just show you that it works you just oh just grow some trees and you see it cuts it cuz the wood the wood goes into the chest here shortly just come you see is coming what goes into the chest and to show you if we fill this in completely that it is eighty percent for what is two rows and a half so if you feel all of that in I mean if it fills itself all in then the sis the security will kick on so let's just fit it in see it turned on the extraction God stopped and everything is not extracting anymore and if I grow a tree it's not going to cut it as you can see so now you have a security them that will not crash your server and it works totally as we have it except this pipe we have going into some smelters what just leave in the comments down below if you want a tutorial on that to know so I hope you enjoyed this and please leave a like if so and please subscribe so thank you and I'll see you when I see a song good bye bye bye
