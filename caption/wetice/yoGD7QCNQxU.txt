hello and welcome back to another video today we have some exciting news so I was twelve point one beta two just came out and I just wanna go take a look at it because there's some exciting changes so the new thing is the emojis so there have been some emojis that were added and then there were some subtle changes and the emojis so there's just a little bit that happened here they were reorganized some are even redesigned some were even changed completely like this Chinese takeaway here so before it was the sticks in the bowl now it's just the sticks in the bowl they are separate so that's a very subtle change so then the second issue that they fixed was the charge gate so that's something that when you plug your iPhone to charge it would not start charging immediately but it will start charging after a while so that's fixed so now it will start charging immediately which is a great I mean it's good now now 3d touch makes a sound so on the iPhone 10 XS and so on you're going to have a small kind of ticking noise when you 3d touch that's just a subtle change into the design and how it works then isom has been added so now in the settings you're gonna see the ESM which means that these sim just came out as Apple said it would come out in this release so 12.1 is the release that they're gonna release the Eason so another feature is that watch faces have been added so if you go into your watch app on your iPhone you're gonna see that you have these new colors so there's 52 new colors of watch faces so you can really customize what kind of color you want to have on your watch face which is a new nice feature subtle change but it does something good on the iPhone XS now what's the new kind of depth effect you can adjust it from the camera so when you're in the camera you can just adjust it which is something that they said in their show and in just came out but now that's something I did not mention in like the iOS videos so that's something I just wanted to add now air power so air power I'm waiting for it it's something that would be really great to charge all your devices at once on one pad I mean apples hinting about air powers and their software's a little bit that means they're kind of working on it but no one knows when it'll be released so there's no release date for it and I hope it's gonna be you know by the end of 2018 or early 2019 in the performance there's no difference it performs really well actually you can still do everything you want it works really fast it's really good and and smooth so there's no problems there whatsoever unlocks quickly everything goes quickly as iOS 12 should be so I'm excited for this update this is going to be a great update of course it's in beta now so you just have to wait a little bit to get it to have the four release that will not have any bugs and problems but if you enjoyed this video leave a like and subscribe it would be greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time with another video bye
