hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some rumors that actually make a lot of sense and we heard most of these last year we heard most of these from Bloomberg about the air pods 3 and the air pods Pro so there should be two versions coming now today maangchi quo and digit x confirmed these things which just says a lot about this report Apple is working on them and they might come as early as later this year but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's get into this super exciting we just got the air Potts 2 in March and Apple is already working on a new pair this actually makes a lot of sense because air buds too weren't originally supposed to launch this here but rather in 2018 as the copyright on the box says copyright Apple 2018 there was also air power on the box so therefore air power and air pods Stewart probably planned to be launched together after the September event however since air power got delayed and they thought they would fix the issues but they never did so they just released the air pods with the packaging how it is now let's just look into these rumors and these two reports that we have today let's start with digit times they say that ear pods three are coming in 2018 and also they confirm a feature that's really exciting for me is that noise cancellation should be coming to the air buds this year it is going to be incredible in an earbud that is so small usually digit times isn't the most trustworthy source but today maangchi quo goes full on and confirms what digit times is saying there is a pro version coming at a higher price however mexico says that a new design is coming however Apple is still working on a new version of earbuds - there will be the air pods to like renew to new versions like the air pods three will be for the people who don't want to spend a lot of money but we don't know the specific price maangchi Kuo says that the price should remain the same at about a hundred ninety-nine which is the current air pod price now we also heard previously from Bloomberg in June of 2018 about apple's plan for the air pod they detailed air pods - and the air pods Pro so I believe that this year Apple will try to capture two markets so the low-end market with an upgraded pair of earbuds - and the higher end market with the air pods Pro they will probably have a black color new coding water resistance but no Pro features those should be the air pods 3 the basic ones maangchi quo now confirms that there should be a pro version so what digit I was saying and what Bloomberg said Mexico's confirming it and he has an incredible track record we don't know what feature we'll see on the new air buds - but we know some on the air pods Pro we will probably for sure have a noise cancellation however this feature will probably require Apple to add a bigger battery because noise cancellation will take up a lot of batteries so hopefully the battery life will go up and a not down there should also be watcher resistance but not the washer resistance to the point where you can actually swim with your air pods but to the point where they can get wet when it's raining when you sweat and so on so a little bit better than we have now there should be new color options on the pro the black color or better known as the space grey will most likely happen the air pots 3 Pro or whatever the airport's pro should be coming in a mate finish instead of a glossy finish that we have now however it's unclear if airports 3 the basic ones will have the same finish or they'll keep the old finish we should be also seeing better sound quality which will be great but that's been getting better and better over the and we will most likely see a health sensor as that is what Apple has been doing for the past years introducing like stuff into the Apple watch into your phone and so on so that is unclear yet so now we have digi times Bloomberg maangchi quo on leaks confirming all these rumors so it's say that we can trust this but let me know which ear buds you will be getting in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
