hello how are you today great day today I'm always changing the outros but that doesn't matter at all today we're going to talk about something that I talked about in the past already today I'm going to do the same thing I did with a 100 D and it is talked about five of my favorite accessories so I've been using the 6d for about I don't know a month or two or so we'll see I'll remember but it's February now so I decided to do this now so the first accessory that may sound that may sound different is actually an iPad yep so why I chose this is because the connectivity with the iPad through Wi-Fi and bluetooth to the iPad to have like the live view or something it's amazing someone can be behind the camera looking doing whatever he wants and you you can see in front what do you base it what the guy is basically seeing who's behind the camera so that's a really great accessory that I love and the connectivity is just perfect now one other accessory that may sound you all so different and I don't know why I chose I dunno why but it may sound different again I chose a remote this is a remote that comes with Canon a great small remote we just open it just to show you a small remote like this now what does remote allows me to do is to take photography at night and bulb what basically it's something if you hold the camera is just gonna be completely this not disturb completely blurry and it's not gonna be a nice picture anyway so this one and the iPad work very well together as well because basically I can just see what I'm doing on the eye without touching the camera to have no shakiness and nothing at all which provides great pictures at night and during their wherever I need that a camera cannot be shaking and has to be not touched at all another accessory is a lens this sounds obvious probably with a camera but since the 6d is a full-frame I had to buy a full frame lens so this is the lens this is a 16 to 35 millimeter just a great lens for videos and photos its ultra wide so 16 to 35 and also it's a 4 aperture so it provides great images that I really love and they're really good really great images but I use also many other different lenses with this camera such as the one I'm recording now with what's actually a very very very very old lens from Canon the 22 105 millimeter it's very old and but it's still great and I love it now another accessory that for me as a vlogger that I love vlogging is this this is a gorilla pod this is very necessary for me just to hold the camera in front of me like this that I can vlog so this was probably the most obvious choice but I kept it as long as I could out out of like the list that I have those interesting ones but this one is really important and I really love this this is the big one the black one otherwise you have the smaller ones but this is I think the biggest I don't know but it really holds the camera well you can attach it anywhere you want so this helps me make time lapses another video like the footage whenever I'm walking or something like that you should watch the vlogs to see how I use the camera but that's basically what I do with this now the most obvious most most obvious is basically you have to charge your batteries right so to change my batteries you get to charge your batteries you get this from cannon this is their charger from cannon it's not the best but it's a really good one compared to like the 100 d charger what's like absolute crap this one really works well it has like also the flashy things to see about how many times it flashes and it shows you how much the battery power has so I don't know let me just said how much power the battery has but what I found and what they love buying whenever I get the new camera is actually this so this actually is a dual charger for the 6d or those kind of mark originally I we bought it for the a TV but this is great to charge two batteries at once it shows you also the percentage while it's charging and you can like to choose low voltage or like high voltage charging what I never understood what the point of that was because it seems like this charging the same amount of time I don't know if you know just let me know in the comment section down below and I'll probably take that advice but this charger compared to this one because this one charges one this one charges two at the very closer similar rate so I really love doing that and since I'm to charge many batteries at once this basically helps me to charge them quicker than if I would have to be waiting for one and charging another one and waiting for one and changing another one so that's perfect with this it's great this also has a car charger adapter and a USB so you can charger with all of these instead of just your standard you know the normal plug I don't know how to call it the normal clock but yeah these are all my accessories so if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and
