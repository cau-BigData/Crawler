[Music] good morning guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so today is the 30th we are about to leave we are just leaving the hotel room right now we packed our stuff I have all of the things what we were taking pictures and videos with and now we are about to go give our suitcases and things to concierge down and then we are going to go walk around Venice a little bit more well we just set our final goodbyes to the hotel for for some time now oh my god there's so much like all the pies okay so we just set our final good-byes from the hotel to the hotel and well we are now going to walk around a little bit just to see what we can find around here just a little bit because we have to spend some time until two-thirty where where we're going to be going to the train station of Santa Lucia again and then but before we left our stuff in the hotel so we're gonna go grab those and then take a boat taxi back to the train station and then a seven and a half hour in the train again oh my god i'm so bored [Music] so we are walking down a nice Street of like many small market shops and next to the sea here we are not really in like all the panels and everything you see in Venice here we're kind of on the edge of of the sea and there are many small restaurants around here so is I really liked walk in this kind of areas and this was like the luckiest week we had since it was sunny every day all day and yes we're gonna try to sign a small cafe just to sit and enjoy since this is our last day and we have still a couple hours left so not so much less that's why we want to enjoy it on the fullest and then we're going to head on back to Vienna and yes that's gonna be kind of sad after [Music] okay so we're going to sit at a nice cafe that is like really close to the watcher where all the boats come it's a really nice area to have a coffee or something about what I'm going to try to do this walk since you remember that yesterday the walk was kind of shorter I like it was like seven minutes today vlog you know my vlogs I wish to do the more than 10 minutes so I'm going to try to do that today but I'm not sure since you're going to sit first eight hours in the train so that's kind of I don't know we'll see okay so we just finished a small coffee break now we're about to walk around a little bit more fine maybe someplace to go eat some last pasta or something before we leave because we're leaving in less than like four hours from Venice and we have to be at the train station earlier so that's sad the time is running out it's running up so I'm getting few more shots and one thing I want to tell you I had any kind of like a presentation from some nice guy of masks yesterday and i'm going to post a video lecture on it's gonna be an italian maybe i'm gonna put some subtitles maybe not but yeah so i'm gonna i hope you're gonna enjoy that [Music] around so we are walking around then it's a little more yeah I'm really enjoying it today since um this is kind of yeah I'm saying this in every clue but I'm really sad and we have to leave this sunny Venice and we go back to like minus five or something like that so that's annoying [Music] at this road name alright so we just finished up in the restaurant after a good lunch again I had again pasta a really nice restaurant like every restaurant here and what is also funny as I said in many of my videos that in these restaurants basically on they they are really small and scary at some point but then when you enter them they look nice and even the people and all the staff that in there that's in the restaurant and the food is great so that's why you're like it now we're walking in a street you can maybe even see that there are this kind of hangers where they hang their clothes this is like a really typical area what I really like since we were walking since two days in areas where it was not that typical you can even see that there's like a gigantic bed sheet that's just hanging off that someone can just completely take see [Music] alright so we're walking next to a prison that was a prison quite many years ago and it's really nice and I think the prisoners that were here where I mean honestly they were just looking out at Venice every day all day but maybe they were not maybe this stupid what I'm saying but I think stage they had like a prison stay that was kind of different from other prison stairs but again so let's walk in few streets again and then we are going to go to the hotel and pick up our luggage and go to train station [Music] okay so we're walking back to the hotel we really have no more time to just spend doing nothing where they have to go because those should leave the hotel in about like less than an hour what is like no time since we have to walk all the way back well this is quite a long journey but anyway I'm still enjoying the walking in Venice because it's beautiful many buildings and all kinds of things like this so I really enjoyed okay so we are back at San Marcos plaza we are going on to the hotel do you know that the hotel is very close to San Marco plaza so we're not that far anymore we're going to get our bags probably sit for a little bit and then we're going to go back home that's kind of sad is almost all right so we are just arriving at the hotel it's probably the last time that we're seeing it for maybe a while because we're not close of coming back but overall it was a great day and I really enjoyed this hotel except was kind of hot in the rooms you know I like sleeping with an open window so there we go all right last time we're seeing the hotel let's get our bags and let's take a boat taxi okay so we are just in the boat XD right now we are on our way to the train station of santa lucia we're taking the Botox again through the main channel is really nice this is the third time we're taking it and really I am still enjoying it for for many times no we go with it quite often [Music] do that you georgeous I don't [Music] alright so we just arrived to the train station of Santa Lucia I'm ahead i'm so sad the train goes in two hours barely and then we're going to be sitting in the train for the next eight hours of my life great i'm so excited and then we're gonna arrive to Vienna and yeah I'm not feeling that too much not killing that too much and then tomorrow's new year yeah well we're gonna see what you're going to do I probably got a vlog yesterday I'm gonna block to the end of the year so we're skiing I'm gonna see ya because this look Kenny we're gonna go up tomorrow but tomorrow's new year so then that vlogs gonna go up a little later but I have few videos that i want to make as you know the end of the year video and these kind of videos so yeah I have some work to do so I'm going to manage even a vlog tomorrow but probably I will just to have like a nice streak of like five logs that's perfect now I really like to do it all right let's go to the train station get our tickets ready maybe locate the train probably not and sit for a while alright so just some time has and two hours about the trains going to leave in like one hour or so something like that we are going to have a train right over here next to me so that's pretty cool we are going to go inside soon sit I'm so sad to be leaving this but I don't even have the view anymore you cannot even see anything anymore he just see this ugly train station and then we're going to arrive to Vienna at mid night so maybe I'm going to vlog into the train except they hate is that the windows in the frames you cannot film anything through them so pretty much I cannot get any footage and even if I do you see the camera and me instead of the outside so that's kind of annoying guys I just want to take time to explain something to you now as you noticed i'm home and it's been a one day since I've been home now what I was gonna say i pick up i was sick in the train i was sick like all day today so i did not finish the vlog but to slog i could not even continue that was just dead sick and i was i just went to bed and slept so i did nothing but its new year today is the 31st and just as you can hear some fireworks are going off already it's 1130 right now so half an hour until new year whoa calm 2017 what I'm super excited for now I'm going to test this camera out how what kind of job is going to do it's probably going to do an amazing job and and we're gonna see but I just wish you a good new year happy new year and everything that you have a great here and yeah so I just vlog has been since 23 days now and i'm sorry but i'm going to edit didn't have it by tomorrow of course yeah but this is from venice footage it was before and then now we are going to die i'm so excited for the fireworks now so enjoy some shots [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh
