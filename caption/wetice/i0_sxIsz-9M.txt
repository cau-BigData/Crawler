hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I would like to take a closer look at io s 12.3 beta 2 that was released just a couple of days specifically on Monday of all this week I will discuss the performance some of the new features and of course the battery life which has been a big topic of discussion when updating from different iOS versions now let's get into the new features but before we do if you're excited for this video then leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more first feature that was quite significant was the modem firmware update that was updated from 1.0 5.00 to 1.0 5.0 1 so what this little update does is fix some of the cellular connectivity issues that you've been having or just a bunch of connectivity issues with Wi-Fi bluetooth cellular and all that for example some people had calls dropping and just crashes went on the phone for me for example so that's something that should be fixed now and I haven't had been having any issues and more then the second update here a new feature was the Apple TV that was updated just inside the App small fixes small updates there it's been a little bit simplified so that's pretty much all the new features covered right here most of the new features will not features but like most of the fixes in this update swear bugs there were many bugs for example the palm rejection bug on the iPad pro where basically if you were drawing it wouldn't it would register your your palm and just like close out of it so just something it was really annoying for many iPad users also three-way calls weren't working as well and the phone would crash causing many problems for many people but now it is fixed in this beta the biggest bug fix was to stop apps from crashing where some apps crashed but was on the developer side so developers fixed all their apps and now they're pretty much working correctly in beta-2 well that is pretty much everything we saw in this update some small fixes but they just helped the quality and the whole overall user experience now you might be asking what kind of bugs did you find or what kind of bugs well I only found the palm rejection bug but otherwise I haven't found any bugs or haven't been experiencing any sort of bugs however there were reports by many people who reported bugs so I would say it depends on the user or depends on the app you're using or depends on the device you're using or I don't have issues so I wouldn't say that this is an issue here but it depends on the person now the speed and the performance has been great and really consistent in this beta everything is smooth there's no lag there's no stutter I would say globally no issues here everything has been working really well for me no issues that's pretty much all I can say now the big topic battery life well it's a massive topic when updating and in the past to remember that it hasn't been very good but overall in the past few betas it has been really really good and I have no problems at all the battery life has been good on all of my devices on my iPad on my iPhone on my Apple watch on all of them even though they don't like the app wash doesn't use iOS but like globally no issues here so this leads us to the question should you update well yeah there you should update because you know it fixes many bugs the performance grade the battery life is great however there's no new features but bug fixes are always great to see now I recommend that you update to this beta so you can fix your bugs as I said previously and any issues you had in the previous ones now one more thing I want to discuss is when will beta 3 come well it is possible that we could see beta 3 next week most likely at the beginning of the week so probably Monday Tuesday Wednesday something like that and also we shouldn't be seen many beta's as June is really close now and the release of iOS 13 is really close so I think this is pretty much the final versions of iOS so maybe one or two more but not much more well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about this beta and how it has been performing for you in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Applause] [Music] you
