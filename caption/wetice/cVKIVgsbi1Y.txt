what's up guys for those that have been with me for quite some time you might know that I used to shoot all my videos on the Canon 6d mark 2 but just recently upgraded to the 5d Mark 4 mostly for its 4k capabilities but for those that are hesitant whether to buy the 60 mark - or the 5d Mark 4 I'll tell you everything you need to know before buying it at first glance you might be thinking that these two cameras are exactly the same especially when the sensor is almost identical however Canon and the 60 mark - as an enthusiasts camera and the 5d Mark 4 as a professional camera and that's due to its many differences firstly by looking at the sensor and processor for professionals this can already mean a lot the 60 mark - offers a full frame 26 megapixel sensor compared to the 5ds 30 megapixel sensor even though that is only 4 megapixels it means 4 million pixels and that can already be a lot further the ISO sensitivity on both cameras is pretty much the same but the processor isn't the 60 mark - offers the newer digit 7 engine while the 5d Mark 4 remains on the older the jig 6 + engine but the little older engine has one particular advantage here burst shooting more about that a little later in the video now this is the part I focused on most one buying the 5d Mark for its video capabilities the 5d Mark 4 offers 4k DCI up to 30 frames per second with slow-motion at 120 frames per second at a resolution of 720p on the other hand the 60 mark 2 offers 1080p up to 60 frames per second and no slow-motion capabilities so the 5d Mark forward definitely has an advantage in videos if you're looking for 4k regarding the interface on both cameras you have a 3.5 millimeter microphone jack and an HDMI output but the 5d Mark 4 is the only one to for a headphone jack so the 5e market for is still winning all right now what did I mean with burst shooting which is mainly used for action photography the 5d Mark 4 has a slight difference at 7 frames per second compared to the 60 mark twos 6.5 of course the difference is very minimal but it changes the game a lot the 5d Mark 4 can shoot an infinite number of JPEGs and up to 30 or RAW files compared to the 60 mark - that can shoot up to 150 JPEGs and up to 21 RAW files so of course for pro action photography this will be the way to go in terms of autofocus the 5d Mark 4 offers a 61 point array in live view and video compared to the 60 mark - with a 45 point array so this difference will allow for a wider area of coverage for the autofocus to work making it great for focusing on subjects that are off-center or aren't completely centered this video is filmed on the 5d and as you can see it's doing a very good job of following where I go on the build end of the camera the major difference will be with the memory card slots the 5d Mark 4 supports two cards a compact flash and a regular SD card compared to the 60 mark - offering only one regular SD card slot further the 5d Mark 4 supports the USB 3.0 connection while the 60 mark 2 remains on the slower and older USB 2.0 connection the build of the camera is also more solid on the 5d but the 60 mark 2 is a little lighter and a little smaller in size which can be an added benefit if you're looking for a small camera that is extremely good on the side of connectivity both cameras have built-in Wi-Fi NFC but the 5d Mark for misses Bluetooth the 5d Mark 4 however has the dual pixel Raw functionality which allows you to adjust the points of sharpness post-capture which is a feature lacking on 60 mark 2 moreover both cameras have built-in GPS and an intervalometer but the 60 mark 2 went here because of its Bluetooth support which can be a big thing for many users so all in all which camera would I recommend so keeping the budget in mind with the 60 mark to being around $1,200 and the 5d mark for being at a little under $2,000 then we have to talk about it the 5d mark 4 has a little higher sensor resolution dual pixel raw 4k capabilities so it's definitely worth the additional five to six hundred dollars or less when buying a used camera the better burst shooting capabilities and a headphone jack just make it even more tempting now looking at the 6d mark 2 it is lighter and has a smaller body with better battery life and bluetooth connectivity it is also less pricey which would allow you to get a good lens instead of paying the additional five to six hundred dollars but both cameras require you to sacrifice a feature or two but buying the 5d Mark 4 will definitely not let you down and that's the option I would go for when looking at long term so in my opinion the 5d Mark 4 is the winner here and definitely has some important points that make it worth your money if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video if you're not following me on Twitter yet then please do that as well for some latest Apple news and some little things about cameras as well also if you missed my previous video then please click the cards shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video you
