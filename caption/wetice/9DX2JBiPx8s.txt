what's up guys we've got the official dates for WWDC from Apple generally WWDC is a software event but we have some hints that it might be a little more than that for the first time since the beginning of WWDC it will be held fully online but we have some new products that might be coming including the air tags Apple branded over ear headphones and one more thing starting with WWDC Apple released a press release talking about what the event will be so it is mostly about the release of new software including iOS watch OS Mac OS and TV OS that is every single year and Apple already confirmed those in the report further one worried they had is if we will still be having a keynote and yes we will so of course we can be excited because it's going to be held under 22nd of June WWDC will be held during that week but the keynote will most likely be a 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the 22nd regarding some iOS 14 rumors we don't really have many more we already previously heard that you might be able to use third-party apps as your default ones then be able to unsend messages in iMessage and some other little things here and there there are also going to be categories for wallpapers and maybe some widgets but since then we don't really have much to go off of so of course all the software will be the main point during the event but this year it seems like there will be some hardware John processor about a month back I believe reported that a few new products will be coming including the over ear headphones and air text we have been talking about the over your headphones for quite some time but the feature set is still unknown but we have a few of them known air tags are also another heavily rumored product that will allow you to track additional things in your find my app it is also said that they should be integrated with AR where in the find my app you will be able to look through and see your red balloon show up when you find item MacRumors reported on that in August or September and shared some images of how it will be implemented and how you will be pairing them one thing we still don't know is the price but I would say it'll be around fifty dollars but that's just a guess one thing we also learned about the over your headphones is that you will be able to change out some parts the rumor is that you will be able to have two different pieces one for workouts and one for other more professional work they will probably have noise cancellation and they will of course be wireless via bluetooth now what about the price well it is set to be around $350 based on John Prosser and a few other sources left a dream has been saying over and twittered that a new iMac could be in the works but is this real well Luft a dream isn't the only one talked about this coin X which has been very accurate in the past is saying that we might be seeing an iMac and a Mac Mini now love to dream tweeted indicating that the new iMac was delayed but we have no indication of when it might be coming for all we know it could be released in may or drink WWDC or even later so there is definitely an iMac on the way but we just don't know when another really exciting thing is that maybe Apple will allow the home pod to use a different music streaming service rather than just Apple music now hopefully this will be able to use Spotify that's the one I use all the time but there are also rumors about a home pod mini which is something I would have never expected there is a chance that it could come during the event at WWDC 2020 alright this is all I have for you guys today if you enjoyed the video then please do leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video follow me over on Twitter for more recent updates and some other things also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music]
