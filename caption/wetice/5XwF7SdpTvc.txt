hello guys and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12.2 beta 6 for the public and developers this is just one week after beta 5 came out so today I would like to take a look at some of the new features and changes that we see in this beta first of all it is a very very small update at just about a hundred and twenty megabytes it depends from which version you're updating and this is probably the final beta I know I've said this about beta 5 but this is actually something that will be probably the last one we're gonna take a look at why just in a second so the official release of iOS 12.2 should come next week during the event as well probably this is unsure but most likely as they're gonna hold an event under 25th of March let's go and take a look at some of the new features and changes so if we navigate over to the About section we can see that some things changed here so we can first see that we have the new limited warranty section or this would be also Apple care if you have that type of thing so you can see clearly everything you have here if you click on it it says your product is covered dadada estimate it expect expiration date October 23 2019 so this just kind of gives you more details about what's happening there and you can purchase some additional stuff if you need that if we go here we can see that we have the model number which finishes with an A what that means is that the a is kind of like signifying that this is the last beta but we've had that in beta 5 as well so that doesn't really mean necessarily anything but it usually signifies that it's the last beta now if we go to settings and go down to screen time we can see here that we have a new loading wheel here before you did not have anything when your screen time was being estimated so that just gives you a little bit of an idea what's coming in how long is gonna take this feature was also introduced in beta 5 but it's something I wanted to show you this time hey Siri setup has also changed a little bit there are a few more steps you take and it's more accurate for when you want to actually set it up so there are more points like what's the weather which was in the past or like show me my emails or stuff like that so that changed so it's gonna be more accurate than before now if we go over back to the phone and we click on the side button and the volume button to bring over the power menu we are going to see there are a few things over here so you have your slides of power off button but the most important thing here is that the animation has actually changed a little bit so watch it and see you see it's kind of fades so it's a really cool animation it's a little change but it's nice to see otherwise no other changes everything is pretty much the same now I wanna look at the performance and the battery life so as you know battery life hasn't been very good in the past betas but it improved significantly in beta 4 and beta 5 so I would naturally expect that beta 6 is going to be better as well so what I noticed in beta 5 is that the battery life was good but not as good as in beta 4 so hopefully we can see the better battery life in beta 6 but stay tuned for another video about that later this week now as I said previously this could be the last beta so it should have a very very good battery life let's take a look at the performance the performance has been very good on all the betas of iOS 12 which was surprising but beta 5 was very very smooth and beta 6 is doing very very well as well so it seemed as fast as beta 5 so there's no other problems here also as Apple is having an event next week this could be the final release and I believe that it's ready I even believe that beta 5 was ready for the actual release but now beta 6 makes it even better it fixes many many things Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity is way better and I don't have as many problems because I had some problems in the past but now I really really enjoy it so that's pretty much it not much changed in iOS 12 point to beta 6 but it's ready for the final release now I would love to hear from you how this beta has been for you and whether you like it or are there any other problem select me no all of that in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more well take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music]
