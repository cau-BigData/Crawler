hello everyone and welcome back to another video it has been a week since the release of iOS twelve point three beta one and now I would like to talk about my experience also you should watch until the end to see why you shouldn't update but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's take a look at what changed in iOS 12.3 beta 1 first of all if we go to settings and navigate over to general and about section we will see a bunch of things here as a menu now here you can see that we are in iOS 12 point 3 and if you click on that you can see the belt number which is 16 F 5 1 1 7 H now if we stay in the About section we have to go all the way here to limited warranty which will tell you exactly what your limited warranties or with your extended warranties or a bunch of stuff about your warranty now this page has more information now with some links right over here so just way more user-friendly if we go back and stay in the about page we can go a little bit lower and see modem firmware now as you can see the modem firmware has been updated to 1.0 5.0 0 which is a way better modem for more than before it should help with connectivity issues and the cost should not drop any more and it's just way better so that has been upgraded now if we exit settings all the way we go over to our Apple TV app as you can see the logo has been changed and it's way better now if we go inside you're going to see that it's gonna load up and you're gonna see the whole redesigned Apple TV app and this is due to the reason that Apple is releasing their own streaming service and also just to take a little notice is that this is what actually I was 13 could look like with the layout and the design that's something nice to see but go ahead and check it out for yourself to see the whole TV app as it's really really cool now continuing with this we have to go all the way back to the Settings app go out of general and find Apple TV settings so it should be right here you click on TV and as you can see there is a whole menu now for all of that so the menu is changed and also the icon as you can see here changed so just way clearer and more settings which is great now there's nothing really else to see in this update everything seems fine no problems there let's get into the review now I would love to hear what you think about the new TV app and the new streaming service in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's take a look at the performance the performance has increased a tiny little bit in this version but not to the point where it is visibly better the CPU and GPU scores have gotten better but just by a couple hundred points however with this change in performance some apps cannot handle it and need to be updated I'm not saying that developers are doing a bad job since it's only the first beta however they have to be updated another important thing before updating battery life the battery life has been a big topic of discussion in the betas of iOS to open too but in iowa's 12.3 it hasn't been too bad I would say it is about the same as in iOS 2.2 however it could be better in reality it could always be better however there is no increase or decrease which is better than a decrease if you know what I mean now why you clicked on this video why shouldn't you update well that is very simple many apps that I use on a daily basis crash or have some of issue that is not very good when you relied a li on some important apps of course it might be just my device or my apps but take precaution before updating well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today obviously there haven't been many changes except for the Apple TV app we are also reaching the end of these betas as iOS 13 is supposed to come in less than two months we might see some new features but probably not very big ones anyway please let me know what you think about this beta and the new streaming service in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
