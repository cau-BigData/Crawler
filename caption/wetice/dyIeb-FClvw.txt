hello guys welcome back to another video today is not a very interesting day with the Apple iOS releases but recently iOS 12.1 point 3 beta 3 was released so this is out for the public the developers beta was out yesterday now it's been almost three weeks since the last Apple beta release which is a long time for Apple but I guess that was due to the holidays and like everyone sleeping and you get the point this update is very small it comes about 140 megabytes which is a tiny update but it's just probably some small fixes and just yeah but there isn't a lot of information about this update it's just nothing it's very interesting what is actually in it and that's a very good question but no one knows only bug fixes and improvements that's about it that's written in the log and we should see features hopefully quite soon I am kind of waiting for that because that's what we've been waiting for about a month or so now but also one thing the battery life hasn't been very good since I was twelve point one point two ish that's where I saw that my battery life was going down quite massively during the day and I was just like maybe it's the Apple watch but then I kind of deactivated my Apple watch from my phone to see what would happen and the battery life is still horrible now hopefully this will change in the official release of iOS to 0.1 point three that we will hopefully see in the next week or so yeah very interesting but yeah let me know if something changed something that you noticed any small feature would be great to know about and hopefully you don't have any issues with connectivity because that's some issues that many people were dealing with especially in like Turkey and China and so on so if you have any of these corrective 80 issues it may be good to go and update to this new Iowa's 12 point 1.3 which will hopefully and we'll fix all of your bugs and connectivity issues that you may be having now I am very satisfied with how Iowa's to open one point three works very smooth there's nothing really noticeable that I can talk about that actual crap it's pretty good it's smooth it's fast there are still some little bugs but I did not notice many of them but otherwise this could be a big update for some of you guys and for some of you it may be just an update like for me that there's not really anything new or just no features have changed but anyway I am really waiting for the newest updates that will hopefully come very shortly because I really want to talk about some features that's very interesting to talk about in Apple but this video I just wanted to tell you a little bit a quick update on what I was to open 1.3 beta 3 years just kind of a heads up so whether or not you should update yes you should update I don't find anything wrong with it it may fix issues for some people it may bring up some issues for some people but overall for me it just works really well and I have no complaints and it's perfect but anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future so we greatly appreciate it and I will see you next time with another video okay bye [Music]
