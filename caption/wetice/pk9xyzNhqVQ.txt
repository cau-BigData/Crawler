hello everyone and welcome back to another video as you know we are already almost mid March and there is supposed to be an apple held event this month therefore I would like to talk about what we will most likely be seeing during this event but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more before we get into the products you might be asking yourself when will we see the actual event well probably on the 25th of March also stay tuned for everything on that by subscribing and hitting the little bell number 1 we should be seeing the air pods - now I don't know in which shape or form but we should be seeing one of them they would most likely come in two colors space gray / black and white there wouldn't be any massive design change but we could see them being thicker and longer with a maddie design similar to the Apple pencil Max Weinbach shirt some more details by saying that they should charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 15 minutes that is insane they should also be getting wireless charging hey Siri functionality the w3 processor bluetooth 5 and maybe but only maybe better battery life number 2 with the wireless charging capability of the new air Potts - we should be seeing air power alongside it is finally coming as it has been in the works for a few years now that is mainly due to the reason that Apple wants to charge the iPhone the Apple watch and the air pods - all at once at the same speed wow that must have been very difficult now I would love to hear what you think about these two products and whether or not you will be getting them in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news a bunch more number three the new entry-level iPads as you know these have been here for quite some time and have been getting regular updates in March so it makes sense for a new one to come very soon ming chico which is a very reliable source for Apple leaks and rumors claims that the new ipad will be about 10.2 inches with thinner bezels there will be probably no face ID and the home button will most likely stay as well the new ipad will feature an a 11 processor and maybe support for the Apple pencil 2 but that is not known at all also the pricing should remain at the same starting price of $329 number four with the new iPads we should be seeing the highly anticipated iPad Mini 5 Ming Jing qu also reports that this one is actually in the works and is supposed to come there wouldn't be a design change and the home button would stay as well we shouldn't be seeing an iPad Mini with an edge-to-edge display and no face ID either the only main change reported right now is the new 8 and processor that will be coming number five the iPod Touch 7 is supposed to be coming as well you know that this one hasn't been updated for quite some time so finally for all the iPod Touch lovers here it comes hopefully Apple has just recently made some trademarks by registering it as a gaming device for their Steve Smith who is an apple developer found a reference in I was 12 that these devices should be coming with this information he also shared that there will be no touch ID nor face ID but all the rest should stay the same with some minor upgrades these are all the hardware changes but as you know we should also be seeing the Apple TV subscription and the news subscription service more on that in a video well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about all these products and whether or not you will be getting them in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] you
