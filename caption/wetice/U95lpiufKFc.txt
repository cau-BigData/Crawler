hello guys welcome back to another video today we have some more iOS 13 news and we have some new rumors some exciting stuff to talk about even though some of these things will ruin someone's day probably but if you're excited for iOS 13 don't forget to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay informed about all the things they're going on right now and in the future today we'll receive a new report about I was 13 and the report talks about which devices will be supported in I was 13 however it's not looking great right now yesterday we got an amazing report from Bloomberg talking about all the massive features were gonna be seeing in iOS 13 new iPhones Mew 2020 iPhones and a bunch of other things so if you want to go check out that video then please click here to start off on a positive note new dynamic wallpapers will be coming in iOS 13 which will be similar to Mac OS Mojave which is great if you have a Mac you can see you can set a dynamic wallpaper which basically darkens during the day showing sunset sunrise all that we will be seeing probably a dark mode which will be kind of a dark version with it where your screens gonna get darker during the day or if you stick with the light version your screen is just going to get lighter in the morning and slowly darker in the evening that will finally refresh the old dynamic wallpapers with this bubble and all this which is kind of dumb but this is an amazing start of the video now let's get into the supportive devices for iOS 13 as you know iOS 12 was a huge update it was released to most of the devices Apple has released because of the bug fixes and stability so you got the u.s. 12 however now iOS 13 will be coming to only a limited amount of devices the device support to be cut Mass which is just a really sad thing to see as many of you own older devices for example iPhone 6s five SES you maybe even own an older iPad the iPad air let's talk about which devices will stay and which will not let's start with the iPhone 6 the standard 6 no update moving on iPhone 5s which is just the low iPhone 6 will not update however this one I understand because that phone is about 6 years old so it doesn't really need an update anymore and probably doesn't support what iOS 13 will bring in terms of memory CPU and all that the iPhone success as well you might have thought that it would be updated however no maybe not maybe yes however this article says that it too will be excluded from the update the iPhone se which is a phone that many people have right now will probably get excluded as well and based on this report probably yes however that's I'm sure since the SC is from 2016 which is not a long time ago and that's only three years so we may not be sure about that but it is a possibility so many people have these kind of phones all of these older models especially the SC I've seen a lot of them around and those will probably not be updatable anymore so you should just start probably saving up or just get over the fact that you'll have to be with iOS 12 let's talk about the iPads now if we start with the iPad minis the iPad Mini 1 2 & 3 will not update anymore iPad Mini 4 is questionable but probably not based on this article so if you have the latest iPad Mini it's not gonna be updatable but that's maybe not a bad thing since the iPad Mini 5 is rumored to come very soon at a very good price all the older iPads except the 2018 iPad will not be updatable either which is something quite bad iPad air and iPad air 2 will have no update whatsoever as well so this seems kind of soon because the iPad air 2 is probably couple years old now I don't know precisely how much but it seems like they're excluding most of their devices iPod Touch 6 if you're an owner of the iPod Touch 6 you will receive no update either but however things get even worse now iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 will probably not be getting the same features as the XS success Mac's and the X if you're an owner of the iPhone 7 you may have different features than the iPhone 8 or even the iPhone X so I don't know how I feel about that but that would be really controversial as you know iPhone 7 iPhone 8 are just like two years old so that's not a lot but anyway let me know what you think about this and whether or not you think this is a good move or a bad move for Apple because I believe this is not a very good move iOS 13 is on track to be released to the developers in June during WWDC just shortly after so we're just five months away from an iOS release which is just super exciting however do we want such an update of iOS 13 that will cut out most of the devices well if the features are so optimized for the newest iPhones that they bring so much more than probably yes however if they are just removing support for all these devices just so that they forced you to get a new iPhone or an iPad then that's just really bad anyway please like if you like and subscribe to be updated very frequently about the newest Apple rumors and iOS updates anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
