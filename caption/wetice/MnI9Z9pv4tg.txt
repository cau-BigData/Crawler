hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 13 point 1 beta 1 for the developers just a week after i OS 13 point o beta 8 this is very surprising and it is also an unexpected release we are going to take a look at it why it is released as well as the new features and changes the update came at about 450 megabytes on my iphone XS that's right over here but the size might vary based on which version you are coming from and what phone and device you have so this varies quite a lot now if we head over into Settings General and we click the About section we're going to see here software version and so we can see that we're running 17 a 58 21 II previously we had a and we went all the way to e meaning that there will be quite many betas over here now let's go take a look at the different changes we have over here now the first now the first change that I'd noticed as you can see this is the volume HUD that you have normally so your chose one is using the speakers of the iPhone but here this symbol will be changing based on if you use air pods or a home pod or any other device now one more thing that we can go and see in settings and if we have back to general we go into fonts and we can see that this time it says no fonts installed you can download apps that install fonts from the App Store so now the fonts are actually here so you can use fonts and they are enabled now three finger-touch so previously you know if you touch the screen with your 3 fingers it will open the copy paste and cut menu which would open up in every app before but now it's actually smarter and it will open up only in the apps which actually need it so as you can see in the Notes app you can triple click and it shows you the cut copy and paste menu right over here on the top so that's the new thing now there are some app I can changes but nothing really important nothing really major but now if we head over into settings and we head over into wallpaper and we go into choose a new wallpaper dine amick as you can see down here we have a new dynamic wallpapers right over here so you can select different one there's more of them where in the past there were only the simple ones but now you have all of these now the automation tab in the shortcuts app is back it is right here in the automation down there where previously it was missing so we are happy to have that back also in the Maps app the share ETA is now working so wherever you go you can share your ETA as much as you want also announced messages with Siri is still missing it didn't come back but it might come back in beta whatever in the next coming ones now why was this beta released why are we and I was 13.1 already well I believe that Iowa's thirteen will be the of course the first one to be released to the public just in about two weeks but I was 13 beta that's the final one we had will be the one released but now with Iowa's thirteen point one I feel like they're patching up the bugs that were really visible and I was thirteen point oh and then they were released I was thirteen point one a couple weeks or a month later from I was thirteen point O so it's just to patch up the bugs but Apple doesn't do this often but it will be interesting to see how these things go now performance battery life and all of that stuff of course I was 13.1 will be improving them hopefully but that's not sure but for now it feels like everything is fast all the apps work really well I have no issues whatsoever so I feel like it's working really well but battery life is unknown yet even though in I was 13 it was really good for me if we head over into the battery tab we're going to see the battery life has been quite quite good for me in my opinion and works really well and yeah but we will have to see how 13.1 improves the battery life because I've been using it only for an hours so I have no idea well this is it for this video so if you enjoy then please leave a like and subscribe and also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown in the upper corner okay take care and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music] you
