hey guys and welcome back to another video how are you today I'm fine today I'm going to talk about my vlogging setup so it's very interesting it's probably one of the heaviest but I find it really good for making videos this is the whole vlogging setup as you saw in the thumbnail so this is what I use to do most of my vlogs so I'm going to piece it into pieces that you can see what I actually use so let's start with this this is the beginning of the whole thing this is the camera so what I use is the 60 mark 2 for making my vlogs I know it's not a very lightweight camera but it's really really good with the autofocus and with the light levels and all the features that they are now with the camera I use this lens and I talked about it previously this lens it is from Canon as well and it is a 16 to 35 millimeter that turns inside it's really great lens with autofocus and stabilizes tabulator so it is a really good lens for vlogging I really enjoyed because it has the big field of view and if you zoom any have the background blur so it works really well for making vlogs and whatever I have to do it's a 4 aperture so yeah it's not the best I guess but it's really good for vlogging for my needs because I usually don't vlog late at night so during the day it works perfectly and most of the time I have no problem with light whatsoever so I'm not complaining about that now the 6d itself has a very good body has a flip screen so that way I can see what I'm recording that's a really big positive that's another reason why I got it even like the ATD has this but it's not full-frame and I wanted a full-frame camera like this one so this really works well with that as well so I really enjoy this camera plus the and then my favorite I use this sound muffler which basically goes on the microphone um and I explain that in a different video so then I use this a rode microphone this is a really good one it's not the most expensive one because there's the one the pro or whatever this is so this is like the basic one but I think that it's really really good sound wise for my needs and for whatever I do so I don't see the need for the video mic Pro so I really enjoy this one it has a battery a 9-volt battery here so you need to sometimes put in there but I have a chargeable one so that's great and it survives a very long time and at last a video I made also is this this is the Joby Gorillapod I use the black one that I just attached to the bottom and it works really really well and it's very stable then one more thing that I enjoy a lot is when I put this on the camera I can still access this opening the hatch for the battery so I don't have to remove the gorilla pod to access the battery which is a big positive for never I'm changing batteries and also this camera has this SD card right here which the 100 you did not have but even the ATD had so that's like my vlogging setup so I hope I explained it in a very good way and this is why I use it I know this camera's not lightweight it gets really heavy at times when you're vlogging all day but it's really worth the footage you have with it so this video will also film in the g7x so it's not the best but I needed the camera for this video alright guys so if you enjoyed this one you should leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in my next video next time bye [Music] you [Music]
