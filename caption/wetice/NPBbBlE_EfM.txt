hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some exciting things to talk about Apple released the new iPod Touch 7 and we also have some exclusive screenshots from iOS 13 that will be coming in less than a week but before we do please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously the new 2019 iPod Touch isn't anything special we have the 8 inch chip the same camera as the front one being at 1.2 megapixels the same battery the same 4 inch LCD display no biometric security meaning no face ID or touch ID and the only thing that's new is that we get a 256 gigabyte model for $399 however why would you spend so much for the iPod Touch there are better phones out there for the same amount of money so it is pretty much not really worth it now the more exciting news we get exclusive screenshots for iOS 13 from Rambo and 9 to 5 Mac we have these screenshots of the dark mode coming in iOS 13 the home screen looks pretty much the same with dark mode except the dock which is a lot darker the next screen shot this is really where you see dark mode it shows us the music app with the true dark mode on the OLED screen the pixels in the dark part won't be used which will result in better battery life these screenshots are actual screenshots from iOS 13 not mock-ups keep that in mind 9 to 5 Mac also confirms that you will be able to toggle on and off dark mode from the control center the next screen shot shows us the interface when you take a screenshot it looks similar to iOS 12 but look at the blurred background in iowa's 12 we would have a white interface which looked very ugly the pencil and all the tools look better here as well in the next screenshot we can see the reminders app which is going to be new as well this shows it on the iPad but it will be also on the iPhone it looks a lot better and the app will be able to compete against other reminders now which it could not in the past finally find my friends and find my iPhone are going to be merging into the same app the name of the app will be fine my which combines both of them together it is significantly better they also show the actual icon for this new app which can be seen on this screenshot well there you have it official iOS 13 screenshots no mock-ups no rumors however you probably noticed that the homescreen didn't change at all but remember that this feature wasn't confirmed by Apple but it is not sure and maybe if we still hope for the best we might see some sort of improvement here next Monday we are going to see iOS 13 so please subscribe to know when my I was 13 videos came out so that you can see all the new features in iOS 13 also let me know what you think about these screenshots in the comments down below okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
