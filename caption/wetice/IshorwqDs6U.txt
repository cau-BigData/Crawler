alright guys welcome back to another video as you can see the intro is new and the intro will be newer and newer because I don't want to use the old intro it's kind of old and it's kind of long so I'm going to change it and it's going to be different so probably for the new videos that will be coming I'll be trying out some intros and you know coming up and trying to find out which intro I like the most and then I will stick to it but the old one I want to kind of remove it now even though I'm so used to it I started this video with the old outro but that's the first thing I will change and will be changing and yeah now the second thing as you can see the light as you can see there's a big light in front of me as you can see on my hands and basically I have only one before I was using two from two sides basically and now I have only one and what only one does is that actually behind me the wall is darker you can do it in the settings but I just feel that I am a more focused the light than the background so basically I come out more in front of the camera than the background so I prefer it and then the other one I've used right next to me over there where I have the unboxing and you know I don't know reading table and I put the other light there so it's gonna be also one light and I really like it it's not just a point of having them separated but I just like how it looks and its new and it's fresh and that's what I like to keep on my channel that it's a lot nicer but fresher and and that's that now this video is also recorded on g7x because I just do not keep it lonely but that's just a slight detail but we don't care about that now now the third thing that I want to talk about is my schedule now my schedule is going to be a little more difficult to talk about and I think I mentioned even in the previous channel update but that change now even though the channel update was like less than a month ago that doesn't matter that doesn't matter but my my schedule will change last week last Friday I use the last geoguessr video because basically it's not been getting so much support as it has been given before so I'm gonna stop that and we're going to change completely what's going to be on Friday and drink oh beep now on mondays we're going to have 10 so on Monday we're gonna have that that means we're gonna have technicals things and I don't know what kind of other things just like reviews and review the our unboxings and just talking about different tech stuff then on Wednesday this is what's really important I want to start blogging more and Ignace the purpose of my channel but every Wednesday I will try to give out a vlog that means that I'll try to record a vlog in the week during the weekend or whatever and then post it on Wednesday so every Wednesday I'll try to have a vlog for you guys and that I don't do at least bring back the point of my channel that is for vlogging and I can get more practice and just make folks a lot better and also you can see that my vlogs have been better and better and I started like the new vlogging you know so if you go to my China vlogs this vlogs and you're gonna have someone episode 2 and you can check out episode 3 that's been already up so three vlogs three weeks already so that's that's been going on for a while and the vlogs are completely different a different style they're not so boring as before in my opinion just go check them out they're great I like them a lot now I will put them in the end screen so if both of them so you can click on first one the second one and you can just check them out I greatly appreciate it if you check them out and let me know what you think of them they're completely different I already liked them anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more like this in the future and I'll see you in my next video bye [Applause] [Music] you
