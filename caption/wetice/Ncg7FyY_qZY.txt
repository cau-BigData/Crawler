hello everyone and welcome back to another video as you know the new iPhones are on the way they're coming or really soon in September specifically and alongside that the iPhone XR 2 with a green color we have some new rumors about battery sizes and really cool charging stuff also we get another report about the 2020 I phones which should change up the whole game but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's start with this year's iPhones the first report is by maangchi co primarily about battery life in the 2019 iPhones you might have noticed that the battery life isn't that very good but of course that depends on your usage however for me and many people I know the phone doesn't last the whole day anyway battery sizes should be going up really cool however we don't know - how many milliamp hours we are also supposed to see bilateral charging which seems to be kind of a replacement for air power bilateral charging basically allows you to place your ear pods or your Apple watch on the phone and they will charge yeah it sounds really cool I know maangchi coil also reports that the iPhone xs2 should have a battery size up to 25% more and the iPhone accesed - up to 15% more the iPhone XR - should have such an improvement the xr2 should be getting anywhere from 0 to 5 percent more that doesn't really matter as the XR already has very good battery life I'm really hoping that this will happen as it's gonna be a life changer now I would love to hear what you think about these changes in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's go all the way to 2020 now we already know that we should be seeing 3d laser cameras that should make amazing photos this was reported by a few sources already like Bloomberg for example and with this new technology Apple will also try to push us to augmented reality which isn't something I really want to do but it's cool to have it now the big news here digit Times reports that the screens will be very different from what we have seen in the past firstly they will be all OLED finally from the low-end model to the highest end model now the screen sizes will be very different the low-end model should have a 5 point 42 inch screen the middle range model should have 6.0 6 inches and the high-end model should have 6 point 6 7 inches as you can see the 5 point inch model is gone as it was replaced with a 6.0 6 inch one the 5.4 2 inch one is made for people who don't want a massive phone and the 6 point 6 7 inch one is for the people who want enormous phones further we learned that the priced rata G should be improved the smallest screen size should have the lowest price and the biggest screen size should have the highest this is something that should have been implemented a long time ago this year many people were left confused with the pricing strategy as the smaller screen was more expensive than the bigger one which yeah this should be improved and simplified for the average buyer well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about these changes in the comments down below and also let me know which iPhone you will be getting in 2020 if you have to choose now also while you're down there consider leaving a like as it helps me tremendously and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
