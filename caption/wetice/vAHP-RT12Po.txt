[Music] hello everyone welcome back to a new video today how are you doing well I'm doing fine so as you know recently the iPhone XR has been released so pre-order you probably even received it so it's just here I mean the iPhone is here so we are super excited everyone's excited but like is the iPhone XR bad or good what is it so there has been a lot of criticism at the beginning when Apple announced it in back in September so let's just talk about it now so of course you know that this iPhone is cheaper at $749 so of course they had to take away some things compared to the thousand dollar iPhone XS and then like further on the iPhone XS Macs the first thing is you get six beautiful colors that look really great and they're from glass so you have a really nice color and you can customize it a little bit more than only the two colors with the iPhone XS and XS Mac's the notch is still there so apples not doing anything about it and it's been the point of criticism for a while now for probably the net past 2 years but the camera is inside of the notch now which means you have a vector true depth camera and face ID has been improved with this so it's still amazing and a great addition the bezel around the iPhone seems to be a little thicker compared to the iPhone XS and XS Mac's but that may be because of the display and they could not stretch it out too much the glass back is not as tough of a Gorilla Glass as the iPhone XS and XS Mac's so if it falls it may break way easier than the iPhone X's rxs max but it's still worth the money to risk it I guess just put the cover on your phone just do that the display is a 6.1 inch retina display LCD which may be too big for some users because 6.1 inches of course and the iPhone excess is five point eight inches so I mean if you're upgrading from like an iPhone 5 or from a four which are really tiny iPhones then you may have a hard time adapting to the 6.1 inches but don't worry from my experience you adapt rather quickly after a few Falls of your phone it is still comfortable to use so there's no concern there you're just gonna get used to the handling the display is good so the display has some nice tones to it some nice colors and it also has a very good brightness actually for fun like that that's a little bit cheaper but you still don't have the amazing colors as on the iPhone XS with the black and and just all the other colors you also don't get a perfect viewing angle compared to the iPhone XS since the f1 XS is an OLED display and the iPhone XR is an LCD so that's the difference so it doesn't have great viewing angles but it's still worth it now Apple ditched the 3d touch and replaced it with haptic touch so you don't have shortcuts to your apps anymore as you had in the iPhone 7 & 8 so it's gonna be kind of more of a pain in the butt but you still have haptic touch to access your flash like your camera by just pressing on it or even scrolling in your typing emails or whatever now the single camera that's in the back it's not as bad as I thought it would be so you still can take stunning pictures you can still take stunning portraits and you can still make and have the bulky effect and like adjust it in your camera after the picture has been taken so you still have that feature but it lacks the optical zoom the 2 X optical zoom that the - excess has it's just not comparable now this one has the digital zoom which is not as crisp in pictures as in the iPhone excess and excess max but you know to take pictures it's still beautiful and you don't need to make professional pictures now no surprises here it still has the a12 Bionic chip as do all the other three iPhones that are there so you still have an amazing performance well gaming while watching movies while doing anything you want you just have an amazing a tool Bionic chip so be happy with that yay now compared to the iPhone XS the iPhone XR has over an hour more battery life than does the iPhone XS so you still get a positive thing here you get more battery life compared to the more expensive iPhone XS the $749 for this iPhone are worth the value and even it's the best phone for the money period that's all to say it's the best yes this phone lacks the OLED display and the digital zoom sucks but it's still an amazing phone for the value so it's fully worth it anyway this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and let me know if you're excited for the Apple show that's coming really soon okay take care I'll see you next time bye
