hello everyone and welcome back to another video previously we learned about the general wide balance settings so if you missed that one please click the card up here however today we're going to learn how to fully customize your white balance on the 60 mark - but the process is very similar on most Canon models the process is very straight forward and it might surprise most but it's only a sheet of white paper now be careful because the paper has to be 100% white it can't have lines or any different colors on it if that happens then your white balance will not be accurate further for the best possible results it is best to be in the neutral picture style more about styles in an upcoming video when you turn your camera on this menu will show up this is in manual mode of course or it'll be auto or any other mode you will be in this menu open up and the only thing you'll have to do is click menu and then of course the first menu will open up or the one you had previously opened so you click on the second menu under the camera tab and you can see that under white balance just under there is a setting called custom white balance so the only thing you have to do here is click on that and then when you took your picture of a white sheet of paper you just have to click a set right over here and the camera will use that data from this picture under the current light settings to basically analyze it and use it for the white balance so we have to do is click OK it will set it and as you can see set white balance to this mode which is the custom white balance okay so now the custom white balance is done and you can go take pictures of course if you want to set the custom white balance a little bit differently you can click here ok it doesn't go automatically and you click this symbol right over here which is the custom white balance which we just set and once you have that go ahead you can take pictures in custom white balance mode alright once you have completed those steps you will have a more accurate white balance in the current light settings keep in mind if the light changes you will have to redo these steps to get a custom white balance further you are able to only have one custom white balance setting so each time you change lighting you have to redo these steps all right all right this might sound very annoying to do at this point so why not just use the auto mode or one of the presets well you will understand in the following pictures so in the first pictures it is set on auto so you can see that the picture is very cold so more towards the blue on the spectrum it is really missing the colors it should have and doesn't really reflect what the reality is on the other hand the second picture has the custom white balance and as you can see it looks much better the colors are more equal and definitely more to my liking you can especially see it on the iPhone eight box which is a little pink by default and not white all right look at both of them now and don't tell me there isn't a visible difference what do you think which one do you like better let me know in the comments down below well this was very easy wasn't it if you learn something new today then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video and please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you
