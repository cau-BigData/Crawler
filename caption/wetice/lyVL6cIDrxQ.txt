hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 12.4 developer beta 4 as you can see here just two weeks after beta 3 it also comes just a day after iOS 12 point three point two for the iPhone 8 plus this update came at about 380 megabytes if you upgraded from developer beta 3 but if you didn't the update size might vary now the first thing we're gonna go take a look at is if you go into settings general and about you're going to stop here and you're gonna see that a build number is 16 G 5 0 4 6 D and as you can see there's a D at the end which tells us that this is most likely not the final beta in this series of betas now if we scroll down just a little lower you can see that the modem firmware has been updated on the newer iPhones but since this one is the iPhone 7 it has just been updated a tiny little bit which should fix connectivity issues if you've had any now nothing else is visible in beta 4 everything seems to be pretty much the same in this whole beta however there are probably many bug fixes since it came out about 380 megabytes and hopefully it fixes some of your Wi-Fi issues that you might been having and so on so that should fix some of that however on this topic I didn't have any issues in beta 3 so everything is working perfectly for me also there were a few reports that battery life wasn't the best in developer beta 3 so this is a test device I cannot really show you the graph but I've been using it on one of my phones to test it out and the battery life on beta 3 for me was good and ok however many people were reporting that the battery life was quite bad also performance is pretty much the same it seems fast as always and there are no issues no crashes no lag no nothing everything's working just really well also connectivity was very good for me I had no issues with cellular or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or any of those but even though I didn't have any it should get even better if you had any in the past so developer beta 4 should fix those as well now when should we expect the final release of Iowa's 2.4 as we saw previously in the About section since this has addy at the end it means that there will be a few more betas I mean at least one more beta so we might be seeing beta 5 next week or the week after so looking at the calendar we should be seeing the beta on the 19th or at latest the 26th and after that we should see the final release probably at the end of June or beginning of July and the latest well this is it for this update there isn't much but some things had to be fixed let me know how Iowa's twelve point four bit developer beta four has been for you in the comments down below and also if you missed my previous video then please click on the card shown in the right corner but before you do please leave a like and subscribe okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
