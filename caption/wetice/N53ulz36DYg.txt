hello guys welcome back to another video today today I want to really talk about the YouTube rewind that has kind of brought a lot of attention to all the creators everyone who is part of the YouTube community and even everyone who just comes and enjoys watching the YouTube rewind so the YouTube rewind this year was in my opinion one of the worst now there have been many videos floating around defending the YouTube rewind and there were some were completely hating the YouTube rewind so this video is not about hating the YouTube rewind nor about defending the YouTube rewind so it's kind of little bit of both in my opinion it's kind of in in the middle so the thing is honestly the YouTube rewind this year was purely as this was purely just a marketing and advertisers video so that advertisers come to the platform now that's what it seemed to me it was just a lot of outside the YouTube community stuff portrayed by YouTube creators so it was not like a celebration of the YouTube community and the past year when YouTube rewind started back in 2011 or so it was purely a celebration and like the top 10 videos of that year and like funny memes funny like saves funny videos that were completely viral that was like what was YouTube rewind in the past and from that point I feel like the only thing they've been doing is kind of targeting the advertisers so that they could go to their platform and advertise and show that they're doing good stuff on the platform however there were many youtubers were not included in the YouTube rewind for example PewDiePie Logan Paul and like many other youtubers who had some controversy this here so I mean in one way I understand why you do not want to put all that in there YouTube rewind because the YouTube rewind should be something that's pleasant to watch is something that kind of shows the advertisers that YouTube isn't that bad if you get what I mean now in my opinion would be great is I mean if they could just make two videos one video being a community kind of recap of the year with the best moments and just kind of like what happened on the platform the past year and then they could make one video that they would show to all their advertisers to just say like look this is our clean polished version of YouTube this is just us asking for advertisers now don't get me wrong advertisers are very important on the platform since they provide a living to many youtubers actually and support some people who just love making videos and want to make a little bit of money on the side now without advertisers there wouldn't be many youtubers who would be able to make a living out of it and make videos on daily basis and just put a lot of effort in their videos so advertisers really helped the platform tremendously however YouTube should not forget that their main goal and the reason they're alive is because of the millions maybe not millions but like thousands of youtubers and the community that uploads videos every day for people to watch I believe that the idea was not bad except to just it was not portrayed in the way that people expected so I there have been many videos from big creators who were part of the video and they said that when they were filming the video to super funny super great and just like they had a lot of fun and it seems funny video however then they said that it just lost its entire point after being edited so this can just be a problem of editing and not a problem of the idea but the video was just it sucked let's say it was a bad one like 2017 the video was ok like I enjoyed it but this year it was really just for advertisers like it was just to show that YouTube is a platform that is good and wants advertisers however YouTube has some good and bad sides and creators will always do some good and bad things but they should not forget that creators are the most important part of the platform and they try to make them happy but then they try not to make them happy it's just like a complicated nightmare and like for example in the video they could have included like the whole D monetization story then why it happened it could just be like a whole video but they could make two videos one for the creators that creators could enjoy and watch what happened in the past year and a video for the advertisers that would have been the best option in my opinion however well we cannot change anything and hopefully YouTube rewind 2019 will be better but anyway this is just me sharing my thoughts on the YouTube rewind I hope you know this video if you did be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this and I'll see you next time with another video okay bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
