in 2018 Apple revolutionized iPad by making them more modern with the introduction of face i d better displays faster processors thinner bezels and most important of all an Apple pencil it attracted so many pro users very similar to the iPhone 10 the iPad pro revolutionized the whole industry but that's not the end Apple is back but not revolutionising but continuing their journey of perfection hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at the iPad pro 2020 that it was just released now let's review it after having it for a little while now we have a faster processor and ultra wide lens a lidar sensor and a keyboard was a trackpad coming into may it will allow you to make your iPad into a laptop let's talk about upgrading because there are many people talking whether these features make it worth the upgrade keep in mind many people don't upgrade their devices especially the iPad pro every single year it's more like every two or three years and this period is actually getting longer and longer so since all of us know this including Apple then why is there a new iPad pro so often well so that they when you decide to upgrade you have the best possible version to last you a very long time if you are at the point of wanting to buy a new iPad pro here is what you can expect starting with a design most of the 20/20 iPad pro resembles greatly the previous model the display is still a 120 Hertz LCD display with a p3 wide color gamut refer to by Apple as the liquid Retina display the face ID camera still remains at 7 megapixels compared to the new 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone 11 Series and no SLO fees further the camera still remains in the portrait position instead of the landscape one so when working on the iPad pro I would say most of us prefer working when it's in landscape mode so it's still a little frustrated the iPad pro still comes as the 11 inch or the 12 point 9 inch with the space gray or silver colors you are still able to use the second-generation Apple pencil which charges inductively and is attached magnetically on the top usually it is expected that Apple uses the new generation processor add some GPU processing power and adds an X to the end and beat all the benchmarks however this year Apple decided to keep the previous version the a12 and create the a 12z Apple claims the changes in this processor make it up to 2.6 times faster than its predecessor now why on earth would Apple put an a 12 Z and not an a 13 X as they usually would it is probably because they focused on the GPU performance instead of an increase in speed but the speeds will not be entirely known until the apps update and we can really see how they perform cameras on iPads are really great for some people especially those that only have an iPad so updating the cameras and upgrading them frequently can make this a great feature for the past few years Apple didn't really touch the camera on the iPad pro but that has changed today the new iPad pro has two cameras instead of only one the wide-angle lens comes at 12 megapixels with an aperture of 128 while the ultra wide-angle lens comes at 10 megapixels with an aperture of 2.4 both of these can shoot up to 4k but it's not as good as on the current iPhone 11 Series it would have been great to see the full camera with the triple-n's set up on the iPad pro with all the features further there is still no portrait mode like there is on the iPhone you might argue that there is a button but it flips around into the selfie mode which okay at the end these cameras are the best in an iPad by far before you consider the cameras is garbage you have to count in the lighter now what is lighter it is a time-of-flight sensor that can measure the time it takes for the light to bounce off an object up to five meters indoor and outdoor these are particularly useful in augmented reality that Apple has been putting a lot of their effort into however this technology is not new Google has been experimenting with it as well and many Android phones already have it for better portraits but there aren't many uses for general users just yet besides the measure of course this feature is going to come to the 2020 I phone 12 so Apple might want developers to start creating apps now before the official release of the iPhone 12 further may be with iPad OS 14 there will be some other major improvements including the highly requested portrait mode on the rear camera the iPad pro features Wi-Fi 6 which is the latest technology that can also be seen in the current iPhone 11 series there is no 5g support here but there are rumors that the upcoming iPhone 12 will be the first device to have it see audio has also been introduced as was first seen on the 16 inch macbook pro towards the end of 2019 it allows for the recording really crisp audio for interviews or podcasts which is very similar to a USB mic all this has been said with the microphone of the new iPad pro the newest addition to the iPad pro and all the iPads that can run iPad OS 13.4 is the new cursor system it can work with any Apple Mouse or third-party Mouse as well as with Apple's trackpad and keyboard with Apple's trackpad and cursor it supports some Mac's gestures to switch between the apps there is also a new magic keyboard with a trackpad coming later this year in May it's a backlit keyboard with a USB C port for faster charging but it is on the pricey side for many people this will be finally the combination they have been dreaming about the regular iPad still dominates the markets so with the addition of all these features to this device it will be truly becoming amazing since the regular iPad has been going down in price year after year many people can be exposed to this new technology of course I cannot review the device entirely because I've had it only for a few days but would I recommend anyone to buy it with all the new features coming and amazing things that this iPad brought I have to say yes if you have the money to buy it then do it and I believe you won't regret it however if you have a current iPad pro and you are happy with it then save up the money for the next generation for even more edition if you enjoyed the video then please do leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also if
