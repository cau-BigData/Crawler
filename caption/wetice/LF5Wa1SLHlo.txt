hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to take a look at Iowa's 13 it is available for all the developers and now you need the latest version of Mac OS to install it it couldn't even be more annoying than this today I would like to show you some of the new features so the first thing I want to look at are some I can't weeks so as you can see we have a new find my app with a completely new design and we have the short Scott's app which is new as well and also if you look closely under reminders you're going to see that it is actually a little bit new with different colors we're gonna get into that a little later another feature is in the control center so you go down you click on the life level the brightness tab you 3d touch on it and then you can see right here that you can switch between light and dark mode and light mode and dark mode this is really amazing let's just switch to light mode for this video let's get into the camera now like this a portrait all right so I have a portrait of myself right over here and what this does you can go and edit and you can adjust the light levels so you can of course adjust your other settings over here but mainly you can move the light over as if you were moving a real light it is really amazing to see this however changing light as previewed in WWDC is not in iOS 13 just yet but you have all these studio lights and all of that which is really cool to see now if you go into your photos into the Search tab right here you can have easier search for whatever you want to type so if I look at pictures of whatever I want I can type it in here it's gonna make a cool search and now also photos use machine learning to suggest what you want to see so it does all of this right from here and it can organize it by days months and years it's really really amazing so I love this now also if you have a video you can add effect in the photo app in your post-production you can add filters effect and rotate the video as well now another thing which is in the Notes app so if we launch the Notes app and we go right into a new note you can type of course it seems to be the same thing as before but it actually isn't so if I have a sentence here right normally you'd hold and then it would copy or whatever you just hold and it selects and you can really copy and do a bunch of things super easy right from your Notes app and this doesn't only work in the Notes app but in many other apps as well there's a new notes checklist right over here so you can do a bunch of checklist as much as you want you can again share notes so you can collaborate with people right from this menu so you can add people to share this with they can only read or you can make changes here to view only and make changes so these are your permissions if we go back now out of this sharing tab and we go into the folder management here so you can easily create new folders right in your folder manager which makes it an even better experience and of course you'll be able to get funds for your different projects for your drawings and so on but that's coming in the fall and you can get all of that right from the app store now one big thing that I love here if I go back to my note so the new thing here is that I can swipe to tag so I can just do what quirky or whatever so I didn't really try to type but you can type simply on your keyboard which is super easy to swipe now instead of undoing text by shaking your phone there's a new option now so instead of doing that shaky thing you just have to actually do something very easy you double tap with three fingers and it will undo whatever you were doing also if you look down here you're going to see that there's a new globe button and a separate emoji button so if you remember in the past you'd have to go here and go into your emojis well not anymore you can just easily type on your emojis right over here which is so cool and with this you saw smoke preview there are new meme og stickers that are also generated for you rights over here so for your mouse some generated ones for your own person some generated ones this really brings back memories back to life it's nice to see and of course this should even work on some previous iPhones but you cannot make your own one but it's going to recommend some of them for you and of course there are some new an emoji that you just saw so there's the mouse there's the octopus and there is the cow so I don't really use these but it's kind of cool to see some new ones of course and now emoji variations so if you go create your new emoji you can select different things right over here different options is really incredible you can also select your hair style your brows your eyes your head your nose your mouth and you can even make makeup now if we head over into the mail app so what you can do right over here is actually block senders so I'm fed up of this one right so I can just block this contact so easily from here and of course also what we were waiting for you can now mute threads so if you do this more you can mute the thread now one of my favorite features and that is the volume HUD so or the HUD so if you adjust your volume as you can see it's big at the beginning and then it becomes this small little thing or right on the corner which is not blocking your view at all and also this thing works similarly in your mute switch so if you want to mute your screen just boom look at the animation on top and then if you want to unmute look at the animation on top so cool now let's go look at the redesigned reminders app so as you can see it was just the folder because I did not use it often but if we go inside right here is the redesigned reminders app so you can add a list for whatever you want for your reminders you can select the color of it you can do a bunch of things here and it's you can even edit some of the things here so you can add a group add a list you can really do some modifications over here another new thing here is that you can download large apps through cellular if you have a big plan of course the Apple News app is adding support for UK and Australia for whatever you want to look at which is great to see for your UK and Australian Apple users another cool thing here is if we go into the Settings app and we go over to battery and we select battery health we're going to see this new option here called optimized battery charging what that does is to reduce battery aging iPhone learns from your daily or charging routine so it can wait to finish charging past eighty percent until you need to use it a really cool feature over here and if we come back up select cellular and select cellular data options you can select load data mode which will help reduce the network usage on your iPhone so for those that have lower plans they can use this simply if we open the books app you're going to have some reading goals that you can set which is so cool right over here you can have a reading goal which can motivate you to read some books if you're up to that now also with your air pods you can actually have cereal read your messages for you and you can reply to them simply when they're in your ears also audio sharing is possible now so you can have a friend with air pods and you can listen to the music from the same phone or a movie or whatever you want to do and now I want to take a look at the full AI voice of Siri so let's take a look it's computer-based and it should sound more natural looks like Bertino California the United States today up to 30 degrees it sounds so more smooth and it doesn't cut between the words as they were recorded which is super cool as well now also you can ask Siri to play radios around you and now the Maps app which is completely new so what you can do over here is move this and you can add favorites and create places so you can add a place do whatever you want right over here and make trips for example and also there's Maps Street View that it was previewed but it's not available in all the countries yet and in u.s. it's gonna be available by the end of 2019 you can also add calendar event attachments and the ps4 and Xbox controllers work on your iPhone so that you can play games on your iPhone using a controller now of course if you go into your health app you are going to have new hearing features where your Apple watch is going to tell you if the environment is too noisy and finally the performance which is really good it's super fast and Swift apps load up to 2 times faster 30% faster face on the unlock and smaller download sizes by up to 60% and before we end off the App Store update tab has been moved so I need to cover this up and it right it's going to be right over here down here of course there are more features than just what I showed you but this is the end of the video also let me know which feature you are most excited about from all of these and leave a like and subscribe if you enjoyed it's greatly appreciated ok take care and I'll see you in the next one [Music] you
