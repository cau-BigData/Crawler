hello welcome welcome to a brand new video and today and I was talking about on twitter you know about that maybe maybe not um I want to be reviewing the GoPro Hero 5 so as you can see here the GoPro Hero 5 is a really interesting it's really small and it's a slick design on it I really like it how it looks and well if it looks really nice and overall I think it's a good camera I I haven't put it to like the massive that looks like a really some like a massive debt but today in this video at least I would want to put it to like the test of the test so and you know what they said on the hey I mean when I was buying the 05 if that is like a good that in fact this is the euro 5 I think this is the euro 5 black I don't know but I think it's the hero by it black I don't know I think but today and they said on the page toward about it is that it's waterproof just like this by itself it's waterproof and it is what is like a massive feature because if you remember with the GoPro Hero 4 or so it was not waterproof and you had to add it you had to have it in like a case to protect it waterproof so this I think is up till 10 meters so that's like two excellent if you want to go scuba diving or or just in general if you want to just make it wet if you go in somewhere it's a perfect camera to have with you now we're going to test the audio shortly we are going to test the water resistance short ah and I will tell I think that will change laws of the image and dark and so on but so far I think it looks nice and it has also this small display here which shows you how much like time you have left for until the SD card is full battery life and how long it's recording and all of that and on the back you have basically to touch display wearing of all the options and and so so that there's a customer button up here would you just pushin it turns recording on and then you have another button right over here and basically that suit really known and often change the mode so that's pretty cool about this GoPro so now let's put it through the pain so number one test and you guys will tell me if now you listen to this this is the g7x was recording this not the best body on the planet but now let's test the GoPro so I'm going to go to the messy card and let's try that is see me and if it sees me at all or something but this is what the GoPro baby please record liking likened like environment of like like butts like fake like artificial ice in certain looking in like my insider in the other camera to see myself right now I'm in super you so you can see that i really like there's a background behind me what's kind of cool if you wanna shoot something but this is how the audio sounds I roses crap or something i'm going to speak in the process of editing but that's really cool right now for me at least so this is basically how you see the displaced gives you the floor right now and that's where you have the display where you see all your options you change like them you'll hear the XPS and what like the resolution you want to have this is where you switch the tree in camera film old and so on others by pushing the button on side what's interesting and then you just have like an easy swipe to this way and you're going to see that this is my recording what I did and you just can easily click on it and and place and then you just push the button that's basically like an iPhone you just push one button then it does everything or you have the battery like how much better you have left here and then you have like a bunch of other things that you can keep but that's pretty cool and as I said on the other side here you see that i have one recording on it you will see the resolution you see how much storage space i can have on the SD card and how much battery i have left so that's pretty cool about this alright so we are in our back room now I'm really excited for this I don't know why I just said my cameras up it's going to be an interesting pitch if it was probably waterproofs I know that is wonderful so we are filling the tub right now with water the GoPro is just sitting alone year next to the water it's kind of fun but yeah we're going to fit this and we're going to set the other things so let's say all right so the test was successful it's waterproof this little thing it's amazing it recorded I hope I got some good shots I'm going to see in the editing of course but you could have see that the quality of the image in like water was maybe good maybe know that I don't know I was not looking at it yeah but you're going to see and let me know of course now that's pretty much it with this so is waterproof it sounds good and well I'm saying it like a good display its touch screen even when there's more on it so that's kind of like great feature way your walk because what is water you don't have to go dry it or something so that's extremely good you can change the field of view in fact I wasn't super view when I worked when I was recording that something but you can I had I was a linear in the tub so you could have seen that the views different and you're like six other views like medium and whatever kind of use you would imagine so the lens is perfect on it and I really like so the camera I would really recommend you to buy the camera if you want to do some action like stuff so yeah basically the verdict I recommend it it's perfect if waterproof there's no water in it hopefully I don't think just water in it but I saw some boughs and I got scared but I guess it it's all okay it's perfect all right so that's pretty much it what I'm going to say about this if you enjoy this video and if you were more if you liked it please be sure to subscribe to be great appreciate it and I'm going to know is in fact I'm going to see you in the next video Aloha William ticket you will see [Music]
