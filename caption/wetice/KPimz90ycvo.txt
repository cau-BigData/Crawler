hello everyone and welcome back to another video after a long time we are finally getting some apple news to talk about the past 24 hours brought us the 2019 iPhone a naming scheme and a look at the new iPad pro as well as the new iPad 7 they will have some insane changes that I'm looking forward to seeing the 2019 iPhone naming schemes have been really complicated to understand in the past few days and months no one really knew until today we have a source over on Twitter called coin X which I have been following for some time now you're probably looking at this and thinking what what the hell is that that does not look trustworthy but if you look at all their tweets all of their previous tweets everything they said happened 100% based on this information the iPhone could follow the naming scheme of the pro that Apple has been putting on a lot of devices recently it's going to be the triple-n's iPhone 11 of course and you'll probably do a regular iPhone as well without the pro at least one of the models will have a pro at the end maybe the 5.8 inch and the 6.5 inch will be pro but for now no one knows another report from Mac at saqqara says that Apple will not put the triple-n's camera only on the iPhone but also on the iPad Pro also they say that the iPad 7 might be getting a dual lens camera originally I thought that the iPad was a budget iPad that anyone could afford at its low price of around 300 dollars but now with the addition of dual cameras I think the price is gonna get bumped up and I find that kind of annoying for people who love the basic iPads and don't want a pro device the release of the new iPhones will be in September of 2019 as we know and it is said that the iPads will be going into production very soon this means that they could be release for everyone in October of 2019 so we'll probably have dual cameras on the iPad and triple-n's cameras on some of the iPhones and maybe the iPad pro Mac attack era shared some images with us showing how these iPads might look and I helped share some renders as well which I personally like and I am NOT against the square triple camera however there are many people that dislike this new design however what I don't get is why would you put such a camera setup on a budget iPad I don't see myself taking pictures on an iPad of course you have a bigger viewing screen which could be beneficial for taking portraits and photos but I still don't see many people using their iPads on the iPhone it is smart as you pull out your phone you take a picture everything is simple and easy as there is in your pocket but with the iPad I just don't get it the a our application will benefit of the multiple lenses as it will be more precise but you know my opinion or they are I don't really like AR I don't see the point to AR at least for now maybe in the future it's going to get better and will bring some new features and something that we don't know about yet but for now AR for me just seems to be a waste of resources but that's just my opinion also Apple is going with the square camera bump and I think it's going to be here for a while and I think you're gonna like it well that is all the latest news we have if you forgot to wash my previous video where I unboxed the iPad pro then please click the card shown in the right corner also please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this okay take care and I will see you in my next video bye [Music] you [Music]
