did you just get a camera or you already have one you clicked on this video so that tells me that you want to use it to its full potential that's step one complete you want to learn one key variable in photography is shutter speed as it's going to make images that auto mode would never be able to do of course aperture and ISO are as important as shutter speed but let's focus on shutter speed in this video you might already know that shutter speed is going to adjust to things in your image the brightness of your image and will either freeze the motion or blur the motion you will be able to learn more about motion blur in one of my next videos when you adjust the shutter speed you are basically changing how fast the shutter of the camera will fire so something like that that means how long the shutter will be open before it closes and stops like from entering and hitting the sensor the shutter button is actually the button that triggers that shutter motion and you press it all the time whether it be on a camera or on a smartphone there are two different terms we use when referring to the time the shutter is open we can call it a slow shutter speed or a fast shutter speed when talking about a slow shutter speed you are most likely going to say that it will be open for an extended period of time that's correct the sensor will be hit with light for a longer time and will create an image with a motion blur of course only if there is motion you are able to create a sense of speed when the objects you are shooting are in movement for instance look at these images what do you see at first sight you see an image with frozen motion meaning that it was taken with a fast shutter speed and on the other hand you see an image that shows motion blur that was taken with a slow shutter speed see it isn't that difficult to understand but what if I want to shoot portraits and I don't care about motion blur well that's when fast shutter speeds come in look this chart shows the different ranges for sure speed on the left you have slow shutter speeds but they can go much lower than that especially when shooting at night on the right you have fast shutter speeds they're used to freeze motion the longest shutter speed you can have on your DSLR is about thirty seconds and it can go to as fast as one eight thousand of a second now that's fast of course more professional cameras are able to go even beyond that now that you understand the concept of motion while controlling shutter speed we have to look at the other aspect how does shutter speed affect exposure exposure is basically the brightness of an image and you might already know how the shutter speed affects it when the shutter speed is fast the shutter closes fast therefore less light enters and the image is less exposed naturally as the shutter speed is slower the shutter is open for a longer period of time making an image that is more exposed but keep in mind that shutter speed is not the only variable you have to change when creating a perfectly exposed image now more about the exposure triangle in this video up here you can click so you also need to take into account ISO an aperture but more about those two in my next video keep in mind that the slower the shutter speed the more stable your camera will have to be since the shutter is open for a long period of time it will capture all the motion you create even when shaking the camera and if you move too much your image will become blurred therefore I recommend that you use a tripod as soon as you dig into the very slow shutter speeds for general photography like landscape portrait or a family photo you don't really want to use a slow shutter speed unless you want to create some motion in your image but you would much rather use something faster however capturing pictures of a busy street might be more interesting when using a slow shutter speed go on and test this for yourself you can do that either by going to shutter priority mode or full manual mode if you feel confident shutter priority mode or TV on your camera will let you focus on the shutter speed while the camera does the rest for you turn the wheel when you have a DSLR until you find the mode T V and play around with it of course is to vary based on each camera what the name of it will be of course if you have any other questions then please don't hesitate to ask them in the comments down below well I hope that you learned something new today and if you did then please leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously and if you want to see more videos like this then do that especially also please don't forget to watch my previous video that will be shown in the corner up here alright take care and I'll see my next video bye [Music] you
