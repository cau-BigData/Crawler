hello guys and welcome back to another video how are you today today is another day here at the unboxing station I'm really excited because today we're unboxing something really cool that I've been waiting for since we ordered it in October and now it's April and that's the Canon APD I'm really happy that finally arrived it was like on and off out of stock or just something that was kind of awkward but now we are going to unbox them super excited this camera was supposed to be before the 60 mark too but the 60 market was in stock and this one was not in stock so then it was just like a big mess but finally it's here so if we get into the unboxing as you can see the Box really nice cos a TV a TV from the top everything beautiful open up I have no idea I think it's gonna be like classical itd unboxing so you have whoa this is the first time I see this you have actually two separate like you have like two separate manuals I have no idea and then if you go further just open that and we have stuff so you get a power cable standard cable for the charger what else then you get the standard charger to charge the camera and lastly well not there's still some more you get the belt a TD EOS a TD and the battery which I think it is the same battery as the 60 so that's really good and there's nothing else in it and now the prize my favorite thing and it is the camera so let's just stick it out right so here it is the ATD I can tell you the first thought it's a lot more lightweight than the 60 mark tool that's obvious and it's really good I think it's a really nice design it has the same button on the same side as the small screen here so it has like the screen here right that has the buttons like the modes it's has everything that it's supposed to have even all of the buttons that the 6d has over here so that's really cool and yeah so I think it's good the unboxing is really good it went well nothing is broken luckily and now I'm just going to go pop a battery in it put the microphone on top and I'm actually gonna give you a video test of this compared to the 16 so I want to see that how it performs probably very well all right so here are both cameras one side is the ATT the other is the sixties written on the bottom so I mean I see a difference just in the view finders but that's because the 6d is on on manual settings and the ATD is on automatic I did not touch anything on it I just turn the camera on but I see that it's a really good performing camera really good focus here I can see that it's very good and very good as well in the 6d so I mean the colors are a little bit different but I think that's because of the man we'll set things but overall I really love it so far I love it a lot so this is where I'll end the video so if you enjoyed beasts leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video all right bye [Music] you
