so we are trucking along and we are following some kind of tourists roads like tourists coastal roads so whenever you come here just try to follow some kind of coastal roads because they are going to get some amazing views of the coast because there are rolls along the coast so that's really really nice I just follow the signs and you you should you should see some nice people [Applause] here we go another small stock summer in somewhere where we just came here because of the beautiful view that is from here and maybe we're also going to go to the restaurant that is close to us but this is like a golf course over here so we're after great lunch here we go it was great lunch and as you saw the preview previously that's where we had lunch and the view is incredible because we saw it pretty much from the restaurant because it had a huge window that was a really nice feature in that restaurant and now let's go continue our our voyage we know Oh [Music] oh cool the truth that you feel is now [Music] one left you all right another slope so we found this beautiful place as you can see behind me we are completely makes to the sea and it's because like in value is so nice around here and well let's see what words x of snakes like I've been looking at the GPS and it took me years Wow [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Music] alright so we just arrived to some kind of spot they call it the historic harbor so we don't know what it is like there's not many folks so I don't think it's a big harbor but we're going to maybe find the cafe and look for for a drink or something adieu see where it takes us again [Music] well it took us exactly five minutes to discover that there's nothing no cafe around here it's just a small fort with nothing really special but it's worth checking out if you're in the area just look around and there are a lot of holiday homes are here so this is where people stay mostly but yeah we're going back to the car and hopefully we're going to get to Dundee shortly nah man I usually like easy [Music] ok so we arrived to another spot of today we're going to drink something to above near here it's called Bell Rock burn so we'll see what they offer over there whether we're next to a harbour over here and we're looking around in a really nice but there's still a lot of wind yesterday but little water and warmer than yesterday so it's a fellow game alright so we're out of the pub and we met some nice people inside me they were really talkative we talked a little bit with them and now we're going back to the car and we're going to go to Dundee to our final destination and then we're probably going to go to dinner and we got the recommendation that there's good steak places there one is actually in our hotel and the other one is some kind of Japanese thing but we'll see which one we choose when we arrive [Music] how was I to know me all right here we go we arrived to our hotel in Dundee it's called epics whatever something and well that's where we're going to stay tonight now I don't know what's the plan for tonight but we're not going to go walk around because Danny doesn't look as such a very nice such a very nice city then it looked on the page for example but because it's more of like an industrial town but we're going to have maybe a steak at the hotel because as we got recommended so I mean there's things we need to think about and we'll know later all right here we go we are in the hotel corridor hallway of of the hotel and we're going now to find our room but the numbers sounds weird and that's kind of confusing but we're going to find our room and then settle down for okay so we are out of their room we just settle down for a little bit now we're going to go down to the bar and study tomorrow stay because we need to find all the locations and put some way points down of all the destination where we're going to go tomorrow so that's the plan for tonight and then we're going to go for dinner and that's going to be the end of the day pretty much so this is where I'll end the vlog I hope you enjoyed if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated and comment some ideas maybe what we miss then maybe we should go see and i'll see you in the next video don't forget to subscribe by the way [Music] you I bye [Music]
