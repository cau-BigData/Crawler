hello guys welcome back to another video today I am super excited because we have a lot of news to talk about so yesterday Bloomberg dropped an amazing report about iOS 13 iPad pro iPads 10 inch iPad iPad Mini next iPhones so the 2019 iPhones and the 2020 iPhones Wow what a massive report but anyway if you're excited leave a like down below and subscribe to stay informed about all the new information that will be seen or really soon let's get into it let's start with iOS 13 dark mode is coming finally I have talked about this for a while now the dark mode would be amazing because we have it on the Mac which is super great and now let's have it on the iPhones and iPads gonna be super exciting the homescreen will have a huge redesign but mostly on the iPad so that doesn't mean that iPhone will not have our indesign it's just that the iPad is going to be completely revamped and look more of like a computer than more of like an iPhone there's gonna be one massive feature on the iPad which is the view tabs in apps so you're gonna see tabs in apps which has been on the Mac for quite some time now and now we're going to be seeing it on the iPad as well carplay is gonna be redesigned as well however we don't have any images any leaks and your rumors about this just that it's going to be redesigned with iOS 13 so there may be changes that you will not expect but it's for sure going to be quite interesting Apple is working on a new subscription and potentially a streaming service subscription but all about that probably in another video because there's not a lot of information about that yet and we may not even be seeing that in the first release of iOS 13 but in 13.1 for example so dark mode is super big a super big upgrade and Bloomberg doesn't only talk about the iOS 13 but about the phones in 2020 and 2019 which is just massive let's start with the 2020 iPhones because that's just something that we never talked about and it's super exciting to see so 5g will be coming to the 2020 iPhones as well as a 3d laser camera which was initially planned for 2019 however it was delayed to 2020 and it may even be delayed further however that is unknown what 3d laser camera would do is accurately map things around you and put them into 3d so that you could have an image in your phone this is kind of seen now with the AR except now you would actually have way more things to do with this 3d laser lens it could also be integrated into Apple maps so that you will see where you're going for example if you're using directions it will show you exactly what you have to see and which exit to take for example or where to walk but that's all for the 20/20 I phones there will be for sure more coming but now let's get back to the 2019 release of the iPhones we have some news here that we did not hear about yet however we know that we're gonna have three cameras on the iPhones in 2019 however Bloomberg says that we will probably see only one model with the three cameras which will probably be like the max model but we don't know about that and what the camera would maybe even be able to do on the XS like X I version not the max it'll probably capture more pixels and probably do some magic with it so you would still have an improvement but you'd probably stick with the two camera set up that I don't know how I feel about that because the max just feels like to be a huge phone and it's just not really practical on day to day basis let me know what you think about that down in the comments we will for sure be seeing some face ID upgrades probably the face ID hardware and it's just with the processor gonna become faster with hardware it's gonna be safer and it's just gonna be way better than even it is now it's super fast now but it's gonna be even faster in the future that's all the iPhone news we have now let's go through the iPads let's start with the iPad pro which had a massive redesign and just complete changes in 2018 at the end of 2018 we had a new iPad pro which means we will probably not be seeing iPad pro in 2019 however we will have a possible iPad pro in 2020 in the spring of 2020 and that's where we may even see the 3d laser camera being introduced for the first time let's look at the budget iPads and the iPad Mini budget iPads and iPad Mini are coming now in spring of 2019 so all of these we will be seeing them in spring which is super soon and we should probably see an Apple event in March 2019 so it's so close it's about a month away iPad minis are said to be probably cheaper than they were ever for all of you people who love your iPad minis they're gonna even be more cheaper and you can get an iPad Mini 5 for a lot less than you bought your iPad Mini for one change that we know now for the iPads is that the nine point seven inch iPad the budget iPads that we see will be getting a bigger screen so it's gonna be upgraded to a ten inch screen which is not a lot but still more screen size however we have no specific details above the iPads yet and what we know is that the Lightning port stays so no USB see on the budget iPads yet well that's it from this amazing article written by Bloomberg Apple is doing so much now and from this article we got so much insight to what Apple is planning and I believe that 2019 and 2020 will be Suvir as Apple is really working on all of their technology abysses to be doing so much right now with the release of air pods to new iPads crazy iPhone tech & iOS 13 dark mode that's their really the most important part here we're getting a dark mode and you can see how excited I am but if you're excited and you'll learn something you please leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos and updates like this anyway take care I'll see you next time
