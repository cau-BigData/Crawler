what's up guys we have our first look at apples pricing for the iPhone 12 lineup as well as a much more in-depth look at the face item module we also have a look at the series 6 Apple watch and some really weird information on the air pods 3 as well as more info about an upcoming iMac as well as an iPad air so yes there is a lot to talk about we know that Apple will be making for iPhone 12 models this year closely resembling the design of the iPad pro further from John Prosser we really see that Apple will move all the components in the knotch closer together and move the speaker into the bezels thus reducing the size of the knotch so finally after having a big notch for three years we'll be getting a smaller one of course it will not completely disappear but it's already a step in the right direction alright you've been waiting for the pricing and surprisingly enough it'll be almost identical to 2019 so you will have two low-end iPhones and then probably to high-end iPhone labeled pro as seen last year all of them will of course come with different screen sizes starting at 5 point 4 inches all the way up to 6 point 7 inches on the highest end model the five point four inch lowest end model will cost you six hundred $49 the second in the line will cost you $50 more than last year at $749 the first pro model will start at 999 dollars with the pro max being at $1,099 so the second lowest end iPhone will be increasing in price but with all the additional features and changes I think it will be worth the extra fifty bucks so that's the iPhone but what goes well with an iPhone the Apple watch we have been hearing many rumors about this year series 6 Apple watch from many different sources now we know a few features that are going to be coming there will be longer battery life and finally sleep tracking I am really looking forward to the increase in battery life because your after year we have only been having 18 hours so having an increase to maybe 20 or 24 hours would be great especially using sleep tracking would require 24-hour bachelor further the Apple watch will be getting a pulse oximeter which will basically measure your blood oxygen saturation which has been reported by many different sources including nine-to-five Mac one thing we don't know is whether all Apple watches will be getting this feature or if it will be just an exclusive series 6 feature we will also be getting a faster processor after 2 years since the series 5 had the identical s4 chip just called s5 also one feature that I don't really understand is the mental health tracking apparently your Apple watch will be able to tell if you're having a good or bad day however we don't really know how it will work just yet whether it will be only for some conditions or what about the air pods when are they coming no source agrees with the other and all of them are saying something different starting with John Prosser he's saying that these new air pots are ready to launch and should be launching alongside a new MacBook Pro this month in May however maangchi quo and dizzy times are telling different stories and keep in mind all these sources have a good record of being correct didja times has been talking about air pods pro-lite which are going to be the pro air pods but without noise cancellation and with a release date at least in the second half of this year if not beginning of 2021 however Ming Chico is saying that the air pods 3 are coming in the first half of 2021 so we really have nothing to go off here on top of all this we are still waiting for Apple's branded headphones so maybe there is just a lot of confusion with these 2 to 3 times during the works one thing that all iMac users hate the huge vessels on the IMAX that haven't changed for so many years a few sources including Mark Garmin have been saying that a new 21 inch iMac is in the works and should be coming in the second half of 2020 what we hope for now is that Apple will be keeping the same size of the body but slimming down the bezels maybe increasing the size of the display up to 2 inches now hopefully this also applies to the bigger 27-inch model but we'll have to wait and see about that point further Apple is also working on an 11 inch iPad with an edge-to-edge display it will be basically the new iPad air that will closely resemble the iPad pro with an in screen touch ID sensors so yes touch ID might be coming back of course there will be some other internal upgrades but the entire feature set is unclear just yet well if you enjoyed the video then you know what to do please leave a like subscribe and hits the belt to stay notified when I release my next video follow me over on Twitter for more frequent updates and some fun stuff also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see you my next video [Music] [Music] you
