hello everybody today is actually an exciting day as you know yesterday was the Apple keynote where they released the iPhones and the watches it was really impressive to watch and let me share some news with you so to start off let's start with the Apple watch which got completely redesigned with a much more rounded and nicer display that's also larger so that's nice changed but the watch is actually not larger it's just the screen that's enlarged and rounded with different changes on the Apple watch like the ECG which you can now take from your wrist so it can help you find diseases in your heart it can tell you if you're in afib and and it just warns you if your hearts going irregularly or if there's a problem now the crown was changed it's now a tactic digital crown which can turn which you can do many things with as well so very small changes here now all the apps were reworked as well to work that you can have multiple icons on one screen the speaker is louder so that's better for phone calls or even for replies from Siri the microphone was placed on the other side which will reduce the interference during phone calls which is a great new feature the processor was also completely redesigned for the s4 which is 2 times faster than the previous watch then the the new fall detection feature which detects a fall and if you don't react within a minute it's gonna call the emergency and this is as well fda-approved which is very impressive that means just the Apple watch was focused on all health related things now the iPhone XS which is one of the new iPhones that came out has a more durable glass so it's like one of the most durable glasses in the world which is actually impressive right and also the big news that we have it's ip68 water-resistant up to 2 meters for 30 minutes so this is a super attina display as well with with actually the contrast ratio going up which is quite impressive the iPhone XS max is one of the biggest phones that they have right now it's a 6.5 inch display so it takes great advantage of films and games so also the speakers have been improved with a wide stereo sound so if you're playing games you can actually play them without headphones now and it's just really impressive as a feature face ID was improved and more secure so you'll have some improvements there and it's more secure than ever so don't be scared using face ID the chip was one of the most impressive things that changed it's an a 12 7 nanometre chip which is impressive now listen to the stats so this one is a six point nine trillion transistors which is 15% faster and 40% more efficient for the high-end one and then it has five trillion transistors and that's 50% more efficient for the low-end one so it's actually really impressive and it has more transistors than on the 11 chip which had only 600 billion so this is actually such an increase for a phone now that also allows Apple to have 512 gigabytes of storage other improvements like the camera which actually has now a 12 megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12 megapixel telephoto camera on the iPhone X s and F 1 X s Mac's also has improvements to the image signal processor now they added another feature which is smart HDR which basically means it takes a bunch of pictures and combines them together giving you the perfect photos and a greater dynamic range the bokeh effect also changed which is actually very impressive where you can adjust the bokeh effect after you have taken the picture so you take a picture with the bokeh effect just go into your settings on the camera and you can just adjust in each picture the bokeh effect you want to have there are some video improvements but it's not that big as I expected no changes into the resolution or anything like that the sensor is 2 times faster which will give better videos there's a better low-light and better stereo sound due to as well as speakers so you really can capture better audio just from your iPhone now there's 30 minutes more battery life on the iPhone XS and 1.5 hours more on the iPhone XS Mac so that's actually a really a lot of battery time extra another great feature they added in these phones in the iPhone X's and XS Mac's is the dual sim technology which can help you have two phone numbers in just one phone what I did not expect was the iPhone XR which I have no idea why it's XR and that's something that they did not mention but it looks kind of like the iPhone 5c when they had all these colors so maybe they should have named it iPhone XE but maybe that doesn't just sound right but it's just gorgeous with all of its colors the yellow one the blue one the red one the silver one the Space Gray just the video was really impressive and it showed all the colors which was really impressive and it can be a nice change to have it still has an advanced LCD display which they call the liquid retina because they had to adjust it to have it like borderless but it still has a lower resolution compared to the iPhone XS and XS Mac's face ID was improved as well and you get to keep the a12 chip so there's no difference their phone has a single sensor camera which is still very capable and it still has all the features included like the bokya effect and and and all these kind of effects and even smart HDR and you still have the 12 megapixel wide-angle lens so you're not losing a lot here now it has 1.5 hours more battery compared to the iPhone 8 plus which is a lot more battery for me at least and haptic touch has been added to replace 3d touch so potentially 3d touch is gone but we don't know that now you can pre-order these iPhones on Friday which is tomorrow and you get it on September 21st for the United States and a few other countries but worldwide it's available September 28th I believe that the iPhone X star will be very popular because of its price at only $749 and with the 256 gigabyte max the iphone XS will start at 999 dollars and the iphone XS max to start at 1,000 $99 so it really great to see these three new phones I will be getting probably the XR or the XS I'm not sure yet but it's just been an impressive year for Apple and many new changes but I was expecting a little bit more even though we should not complain there was a lot changed but hopefully next year is going to be even better so silly [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
