hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 13 point for developer beta 5 to the registered developers about a week after beta 4 there are also updates for Mac OS iPad OS and TV OS there's of course no wash OS update just yet but we should be seeing that within the next few days we are going to take a look at the changes battery life performance and other bug fixes also stay until the end of the video to see when we might be seeing the final release of iOS 13 point for so the update came at about a hundred and twenty megabytes on my iPhone 11 Pro max which is quite a very small update and it's even the same on iPad OS so when the size is going down it usually means that we are getting very close to the final release now over the next few things are gonna really see that it's really close to the final release so if we head over into settings and we head over to general About section you can see that we're running 17 a 5 to 55 a so the a at the end also means that we are definitely coming close to release because it's the second time in a row if we had a little lower we can see that the modem firmware right here has not been updated at all either which is another indication that the final release is coming very soon so since this is beta 5 who will probably not be seeing much more changes on here because it's coming towards the end but there will mostly be software fixes like bug fixes security enhancements and other things that you don't really see so let's take a look at some of the bugs that were fixed and some of the changes the first bug is the notification bug that seems to be fixed at the moment basically what would happen is that all the notifications would overlap and you as you can see it's actually quite good there's no overlapping so there's no problem there I have been following up on this one and I didn't notice anyone else having it anymore but I had those issues in beta 2 & 3 but since beta 4 this issue is gone and fixed so I would say it's completely fixed in beta 5 another bug that I noticed last in beta 3 I believe is the about section hanging if you remember back then it would just stutter here for like two or three seconds before opening this one up that's not the case anymore since beta four so definitely you have a little bump up on performance right over there I was also reading that many people complained about connectivity issues on beta 3 and beta 4 but then it got fixed for them in beta 4 and beta 5 ish but I really don't know how to explain that because the modem firmware remained the same so there's no logical explanation but if you are still having connectivity issues then let me know in the comments down below another really annoying bug that is still here is the Instagram bug so what that bug is basically when you open up Instagram you play a video you exit the app you go into another one or just stay on the home screen the audio would still keep playing so I just set this out right when I downloaded beta 5 and this bug is definitely still here another bug is with the messages as you can see I have banners 36 messages however I have no notification whatsoever about the messages and that's on the lockscreen I don't get a banner I don't get anything so I really have to manually go into the messages app to check if I have any new messages so this is not fixed yet for so many beta so hopefully this will be fixed really soon people have also been reporting a notification delay bug which basically would delay notifications by 30 minutes or up to 2 hours from the time the notification was sent so that's really annoying I personally didn't have this for quite some time I had at the beginning of 13.4 I believe with the Apple watch where I didn't really sink together with the notifications but since then I didn't have any bugs whatsoever the mail app has also been getting much better over 13.4 they really tweaked a lot and made it a much better experience than it was previously it really looks like the mail app is mostly fixed and I didn't see any more bugs in beta 5 and beta 4 what about performance and battery life well performance is pretty the same compared to beta 4 so you will not notice any significant difference in regular usage of the phone generally throughout 13.4 the performance has gotten significantly better and but it stayed mostly the same except some bugs which made the experience a little better now battery life is also very good on 13.4 I really have no issues whatsoever but then it of course depends on the usage of your phone but even if you look on a day of like 6 hours of usage I went through like 50% of my battery so that's really good the battery life didn't decrease it's about the same on my iPhone and my iPad pro however last time I got a comment about battery draining on the 11 inch iPad pro but I didn't have that so hopefully that's fixed for you but if it isn't let me know in the comments down below what about the release date so now we're currently on the 11th of March so I would say that we could be seeing the final release next week 16 16 17 18 or 19 sometime around that period or we could still see beta 6 and then have the final release on the week of the 23rd something there so that's really we will have to see how the situation develops and how Apple decides when to release it well
