[Music] good morning I'm after shower again and I look stupid again but it's gonna get better during the day today I have one thing to do first so I've had these boxes here for like ever now and I've got this new foot this tripod was the same thing the one I'm using so we're going to unbox it now all right there's no okay now how does this work [Music] [Music] this is it so this one's supposed to be the same as the one I'm using already except it's from a different brand so I hope it's the same so we're outside and I think that this thing will hold even though it's different than the one I have but it looks the same let's try to shoot the time-lapse while I'm waiting for this camera to do its timelapse over here it's just going slowly I mean I have time so that's the time of says you're going to see and I'm just have to wait for that so meanwhile we're just going to go do an unboxing of vacuum cleaner that we bought yesterday [Music] [Music] but I just see that the vacuum is incomplete pieces this is going to be very interesting I have no idea how we're going to mount this vacuum but it's going to be very interesting to do though so here are all the parts that we need to put this vacuum cleaner to get there and now I'm going to attempt to put it together this I think goes here okay that's really simple I have this pistol looking thing [Music] okay that's simple and now so I actually folded that entire vacuum in just one small time-lapse segment and very proud I don't even look at the manual so that's very good now we are going to go put it through the test if it's actually vacuums and if it actually works okay so I never thought that I'm gonna be putting flour all over the floor in the living room but that's what we're actually doing now to actually see if the vacuum cleaner works now I'll have to clean the mess so as you can see the floor that we had all white is now completely clean this vacuum works great but now the vacuum is all white [Music] so right now we are outside here and we're taking some pictures as you can see with the the new lens the 18 to 135 so actually it's some kind of nice place what we're shooting here and even the distance there's some kind of fog so it makes it really nice and now actually we're going to try to figure out a way to take an HDMI cable plug it all the way to the screen and get to see the pictures that would be the ideal and that way we can see because outside here and there Sun cannot really see as you can see here the whole screen what you see on the camera I can see it all here we're going to also see the pictures so this way we know easily and we see better it's too bright but we can see all the images here that's great so it took at least 20 or 30 pictures in different ISO different ranges and so on we just looked at them on the big screen over here and well there were some pictures that were not very nice so most of them but now this is where I'll end the vlog if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe you'll be greatly appreciated I'll see you in the next vlog bye [Music]
