hello guys and welcome back to another video welcome today today I'm going to talk about something similar than something we did today I'd like to talk about my five favorite GoPro accessories now I'm pretty sure that these accessories will work with all the GoPro versions but I'm not sure so don't take my word on that I'm using the GoPro Hero 5 black so this is with what I'm using them and if you want to get all of these then I don't know try them or Google it anyway today I'm going to show you those five of my favorite accessories let's start with the first one which is very important this is the SD card that I use for the GoPro which is a 128 gigabyte 90 write speed this is an extreme plus it may be overkill it may be overkill I don't know but it works perfectly to record with 4k on this small camera so it's perfect and it has a lot of storage which is very necessary with the stupid GoPro I can do about 3 hours of 4k footage on this so it's not a lot and it's it takes a lot of storage the stupid files so yeah anyway that's the first one the second one is something that I love so so very much this is a floaty thing let's call it this you just attach this to the GoPro and if the GoPro falls in the water it's just gonna turn around and just float like this and it's not gonna sink so this way your GoPro is safe to go into the ocean or something like that so if you drop it it's just gonna float and you can just go pick it up and have no problems whatsoever with it's sinking and you're diving in and a shark eating your head or something I don't know that's maybe an over-exaggeration now the third accessory that I love is this clip-on thing so this clip-on thing you just would imagine to clip something that's all it does so you clip something somewhere for example here I don't know where now that's the third accessory clip thing on wherever you want on the rail somewhere on the sidewalk on a shelf I don't know we just think of ideas where you can put it I guess that's the third accessory now the fourth which I really like and it may sound stupid for some people even it seems stupid for me at the beginning this goes on your hand so you put this up on your hand but it doesn't have to be on your hand so then you start up tie it up close it and then you just tight it this there we go so you put that on your hand and you go pro stuff like this but me I found the word summer me I found some how else to use it me I just put it over something somewhere and just make it fold I don't have to put it on my hand even though I use it sometimes in the hand you just can put it wherever on the rail I don't know on a balcony or something like that on a tube for example just like this hold it you can do that for example and it's gonna work perfectly it's gonna stay there so it's not just necessarily for your hand it can be used elsewhere now the last accessory this is also one of my favorite accessories as all of them are because this video is go pro favorite accessories so this one is very simple put on your head I don't have a mirror so I don't know what I'm doing but you get the point you put this on your head like so and you just put the GoPro up here and tighten it and you'll look wherever you want and it's gonna film that and I look ridiculous in this but it works really well and films wherever you're looking in whatever you're doing so that's great so all of these accessories are really great for making videos with the GoPro there are many other GoPro accessories let me know in the comment section down below which are your favorite GoPro accessories and I'll read them and I'll maybe see if I have those but probably I do because I have a big set and yeah some of them are completely useless and some of them are really great like all of these that I pointed out alright so this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in my next video next time bye [Music] you [Music]
