hello and welcome back to another video so today is an exciting day so I bought recently the Apple watch series for here and today I would like to review it just a little bit and kind of give you some details about it and my opinions for the past few days and how my experience with the watch was so I mean overall it was great great experience the first watch I ever got this is the 14 millimeter one because the 44 was out of stock so it was just like whatever and I found even the 40 for it to be a little bit too big than the 40 so I guess I think this is really the perfect size now I really love the new features like the heart the the activity thing the battery life is overall really really great so I mean I took this watch off my nightstand at like 7 a.m. it's 221 and I have 84% of battery left Wow so I mean the battery life is really really good and everything about it is really good I exercise with it today it just works really well customizable I downloaded some applications it goes really well through the application of the Apple watch so it really works as its supposed to now one thing that is not implemented yet is the ECG which will come out later on in another update well that's something that I miss but I guess it's gonna come soon and then we can see what it is so it really all the apps the digital crown everything it just has a very nice feel to it the display the edge to edge it's really beautiful and kind of even gives you an idea of the iPhones so Wow really liked it I got the space gray band obviously which is really nice and is really good actually so they changed also the water resistance so it's a lot more what resistant well I took showers with it and I get wash my hands and it's still working so obviously it's water-resistant however I did not go into a pool with it yet so we'll see what happens but obviously they have a swimming workout kind of routine that you can have so obviously it has to support the pool but I forgot till how many meters deep can go but I think it's it's not bad it's like your standard swim pool even like deeper probably but really overall great experience I slept with Eddie even and it's really comfortable it doesn't bother me and that's probably because of the band since it's so soft that you even forget that you have the watch in your hand and you just perfect all the applications work really well it plays really well so far I have no problems and I hope not to have any problems but really really I am really enjoying it and also the customizable icons and the complications really interesting and that's the watch OS 5 which implemented all the complications and all kind of things like that so really works well adjustable from your iPhone you can download the apps they sync directly to your watch which is Wow impressive no it's it works really well the connectivity between the phone is really good the connectivity between the headphones really good I use the air pods and it just works really well except there's like one thing that kind of annoys me and that's that I have Spotify but I can't seem to find how to make Spotify work on the watch since it only supports Apple music so that's kind of a bummer because how do you want to listen to music so I may switch to Apple music but I'm not really happy with that because Spotify I feel is better than Apple music but it's my opinion or maybe that's just thing that I believe and that Apple music is very equivalent to Spotify I don't know I've had to do some research about that may believe will now figure out how to put Spotify on the watch but it's my only real complaint really like I mean it's it works Siri works everything works it has a great audio actually I made phone calls let I have my wrist like next to my leg let's say I can speak and it still hears like the other person still hears me clearly and there's like no interference with the speaker since it would move to the other side so overall a very very positive experience with the watch well the sit for this video I'll come back put another video that will be kind of like one week with the watch or something like that so just share my thoughts about it after a week this is fresh so I still don't know if it's going to work like this and if I'll find some other problems and stuff like that so until now take care leave a like and subscribe if you enjoyed if you want more videos like this let me know that in the comments or by leaving a like and by subscribing yeah okay thank you I'll see you next time bye
