hello everyone and welcome back to another video air pods and airports pro could be just around the corner and could be coming out today tomorrow or sometime this week I mean we are really coming close to it and more and more sources are saying that they are coming this week now you know there are some more leaked images as well but I still have some hard times believing in all these stories since we've been told this in spring of last year and we're hearing pretty much the same thing but there are some sources that are actually from spring that are confirming that it should be coming now let's go take a look at it another source says that they will go on sale this week and they will not just be announced but they will actually be able to be bought now this is confirmed by Ben Gaskin over on Twitter and he was correct previously with the iPhone 10 design and more recently with the first look at the volume HUD before anyone else so he has quite a good track record but I don't know how this will go now is all of this true I don't really know but there's another source from the factory saying the same thing and I just don't know because Apple was supposed to release the new air pods in October of 2018 and it got delayed by six months and so now if it doesn't come out this week or this month then we will have to wait six months something like that so I really don't know if any of this is true but all these sources create kind of a compelling story what about the air pods Pro now so we have a source the economic daily news in China and they say that as many as eight new color options should be coming like white black those I kind of get because that's cool but also midnight green and purple and orange and all the other colors that we see with the iPhones but Apple never did that with the air pods so I mean maybe it's gonna be a first I mean they were previously seen these kind of colors on the beats which now Apple owns Beats so we saw these colors multiple color options but never the air pods and I never imagined to have like space gray or like something like that or like gold air pods that would be cool and also I could get the gold and silver and those kind of air pods but the colored ones not really sure about that but if you remember in the past on leaks reported that there would be a refresh to the air pots in spring but the new air pods would come and fall that's what happened and now it's fall and it should be coming he also talked about new color options in the past so in spring one he released that tweet he talked about the colors but he never said that there would be eight colors but there might be some truth to it however we will not know until they come up well we actually might be getting the eight colors which I still can't believe and Apple I think is settling with this design and it will most likely be here soon in this kind of design for the air pods Pro well this is the end so this is kind of a quick update video if you enjoy then please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and if you didn't watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here and you can go watch it okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] [Music] you [Music]
