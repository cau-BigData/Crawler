hello everybody and welcome back to another video today is a channel update we're going to talk about some important things that will be changing on my channel and a little bit of the future so the first point I want to cover is that this is the last video of summer so summer's over winter is coming it's just gonna be a pain in the butt to go through winter again but that doesn't matter because we're going to do some exciting things this winter now let's talk about the second point which is my schedule so as I talked previously I was thinking of staying with two videos a week but actually I changed that so we're going to three videos a week as always as for the past three years so we're going three videos a week but at a different schedule so normally I was going Monday Wednesday Friday but this year I'm gonna go with Sunday Tuesday and Thursday so now let me take you through each and each day now on Sunday there will be some kind of travel vlog video something like that so for the next fourteen weeks there will be a sailing video then on Tuesday there will be a tech Tuesday kind of video like it can be an unboxing or review or talking about some technology or doing some upgrades or whatever something related to technology and all its components or accessories or whatever on Thursday it's going to be kind of like a laid-back day so we can do pretty much whatever we want it can be games reactions whatever you want even gameplay and and like some other games on Steam for example but let me know that in the comments if you want to see something like that but for the moment I'm going to stick with geoguessr which pretty much all of you seem to enjoy and I enjoy well so I'm gonna keep doing that until all of us have enough so that's the plan for each and every week now the third point I want to cover is the sailing videos so I know I've been talking about the sailing videos since June yes they are done well 10x those are the 14 as of the 29th of August so here's the 29 30 28 29 so I hated the 10 episodes already yeah it's a lot of work I've been working on them since the 10th of August which is quite a long time for tenants so it's like an episode every two days I love them my family loves them my friends love them even though they may be just like saying that shouldn't make me happy but I love them so that's the most important and I hope you will love them so the first episode will go out on Sunday September 2nd this will be the first episode of all the sailing and then it's going to continue all the way till the end of November most likely so that's like the main things I wanted to cover as well as you saw that the studio is new which is amazing the color just goes a lot better with everything and I like it it's better than the blue I had previously now that's the fifth and last point the success we've got this summer on my channel is that wow I have not been paying attention too much because I've been sailing I've been doing a lot of stuff outside YouTube and Internet so I was not online a lot and all the videos are scheduled so there was no interaction or whatsoever so even those people who wrote comments they may have gotten the reply like a month later which is not normal for me because I usually reply within 24 hours but yeah I did not pay I I have not been paying attention to anything about you and what I saw now is that we gained probably like 50 subscribers during the whole summer and like 10,000 views during summer probably it's just impressive for me you know that's a lot of people a lot of views and even 50 subscribers is impressive for me even though for some of you you may seem like a small amount that's 50 people they cannot even fit in this room I'm pretty sure anyway let's do it for this video so if you want me to do more channel updates like this to inform you about different things I'm working on or stuff like that let me know in the comment section down below and let me know about some games you'd like to see and about some reactions or whatever you want to see and I look to it anyway leave a like subscribe it's all greatly appreciated I love every single one of you for subscribing and this is it take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you [Music]
