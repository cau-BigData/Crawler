hello welcome back to a brand new video how are you today I'm fine I'm great now let me know how are you now today is a different video today we're going to do another kind of tech review something about tech so it's going to be something that I use quite often and it's a light bulb many others use it of course many of us use light bulbs now that's not the reason I'm making this video many of us know what still a huge right now for those who don't it's basically a light bulb that you can change the color and you can do it from your phone using Siri or likes or whatever that's something different for another video now today I got this light bulb right this light bulb here it's not the first shoe light so that you can see it's a different brand as you can see this light bulb is from inner so this is some kind of small company that makes these light bulbs and well I'm here to preview this product now this video is not sponsored by inner so just don't get there now I've been using this light bulb for a while now and I see some problems and some good things about this one it's cheaper than a normal one so that's a great feature about it but on the other hand I know why it's cheaper than another Philips you the problem with this light bulb this one right here is that it doesn't work with Siri and it kind of makes some mess with your philips your application so that's a big big negative unless you if you don't want to use Siri to switch up your lights or do that then will buy go ahead it's like 2030 dollars cheaper than than the Norrell then like the real so it's you like Bob it's great for that you can change the color you can do whatever you want with it the same thing is with the Philips you want except you cannot control it with Siri and it kind of makes a mess with your rooms and and whatever it works how that I have no idea had no clue how that's work overall if I should say big big positive but a big negative for those people who want to use it with Siri and want to have something that's stable it of sometimes this light bulb turns on randomly at night for some odd reason I don't know what you did in ER but your light bulb turns on at night by itself I wake up at night sometimes like that specific lamp on like otherwise you know I switch up my lamps before I go to sleep I'm not stupid oh but that lock turns on by itself I think I don't know because anyway Phillips you and this one you use it on like the switch is on in the lab it's off only from your phone so I guess it bypassed that and turned it on then in mixedness I don't know but this is kind of a short review about it I think if you want it I recommend it if you end the real thing then you should go ahead and spend the extra dollar but if you just want to see what the colorful light bulb does that you can control with your phone then this is what I recommend there we go that's that's the whole thing I'm going to say now these now stay tuned for another video where I'll compare this one and the Philips you real light bulb and and I'll show you that but anyway guys thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed until next time take care and I'll see you with another video and don't forget to leave a like and subscribe this out role is the worst of the entire world let's take care by [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music]
