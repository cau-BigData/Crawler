hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to take a look at Iowa's 12.4 developer beta 1 which came out on Wednesday last week just after iOS 12.3 and today I'd like to share my experience with this beta but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do please leave a like and subscribe as this greatly appreciated and helps me out a lot this beta comes at about 2.9 gigabytes on my iphone XS which is quite interesting and big actually now if we go onto the phone which it updates it on if we go into the Settings app we go on to general about and then we click software version as you can see the build number has a G at the end now what does G mean G means that the version is unstable it is not as stable as a b or c which are the betas we've been seeing in the past now let's look at some of the new features we have in this beta so if we go over into the Apple TV app which is the first thing we have to get into as you can see everything is a little bit different the the organization is different and it's specifically tailored to you instead of being just random another thing that we see here is that the modern firmware was updated to 1.0 6.01 which is quite a big improvement there's also a new face ID unlock animation which can be seen right here it's it's feels different so it feels like it's zooming in it's a great improvement to see that face ID is getting faster and it also affects MIMO G and an emoji as they can scan your face way better than before and more accurately another thing in this update is that you can go to your Apple TV remote and it's a little bit different if your Apple TV's running the beta as well so it's a lot smoother and the experience is a lot better air pods and beats are pairing a little bit fast I don't know what happened but they're pairing a lot faster as well now let's take a look at the worst things in this beta so one thing that I noticed in this beta is the music widgets which are absurdly annoying so if you go into your music for example right here alright so this would be what you'd be showing on your lock screen right over here and the thing is that this section wouldn't be updating as often as you think so if the song played and finished it would still stay like this instead of changing to the other song now also this is connected to my home pod and the whole pod can start playing randomly at random times during the night during the day or whatever so if you have a home pod do not update it's gonna be super super annoying now let's take a look at the battery life so this phone is just for this video but I already tested the battery life on a different device and it is horrible horrible like it's terrible it's not very good it's pretty much a step back from iOS 12.3 now the performance isn't any good either it's just seemed slower and the phone gets a little hotter than usual so it's a big difference from twelve point two and twelve point three now the question you came here for should you update well there are some new features it's there's the applecart is introduced and so on but I would say that there are many more bad things than get things in this update so you should wait for the next beta until everything gets fixed or if you really want to see the features then take a different device don't put it on your daily driver as that's gonna be a really annoying well one more thing before I cut this video is why did this better come now and that's due to the apple cart as I mentioned previously coming this summer and who will most likely be seeing this card during WWDC it's a possibility that it can be introduced there well this is the end of the video I would really like to know if you updated to 12.4 and how your experience has also please leave a like and subscribe as it is greatly appreciated and it helps me out a lot ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
