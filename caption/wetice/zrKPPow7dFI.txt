just before I start this video this is not a paid endorsement hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today today is another great day you may see the hint behind this video behind me but it's actually not the correct box but today we're opening this there we go this is what we're opening trusty knife that's all - so today we're opening something different today we're opening this did you read that even maybe I mean um guerrilla this is a gorilla pod now I have this gorilla pod this one's a little smaller one it's religious index this one supposedly it bigger so we're opening this right now let's see what this will be but there we go this is it okay this is it actually the whole thing so as you can see we're there for the dole what is the only one okay here maybe you can see that this one is smaller than this one so yeah remove that there we go so this one is bigger as you can see by just a little bit you know if you put it together this much bigger but these two are great tripods I love Joby Gorillapod they're the best I tried many such as I don't even know where they are so I'm not even gonna bother but I think this was gonna be quite a good one since it's going to be for the APD's so there's gonna be a bunch of unboxings I'll do the ATV but if I should show you one more thing if you unscrew this and you can remove it so I have this and then you have this small little thing to attach your camera so it's literally the same thing as here except you need kind of like an adapter thingy here what oh you can have an adapter thingy to attach them both the adapter thingies right on there so then you just easily attach it back let's not be hard there we go that's it back and this you can buy them without or wait how long do I have to keep going you can buy them with or without this but this is just that you can move this thing around so that's just the great thing about this so I'm not gonna complain you can put it in whatever orientation like this there we go so that's good this is what this is so this is the new gorilla pod it's bigger and I said and it should hold the weight of a bigger camera so I hope you do not fall but this is it this is the unboxing and initial thoughts of it I'm going to make a comprehensive review of this in the future probably after something bad happens but we're gonna see what happens with this hopefully nothing bad and I'll be back reviewing this either way even if something but doesn't happen I'm just gonna give you a preview of this later but for now this one's great [Music] you
