hello guys and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about the Samsung Galaxy fold you've probably heard about what's going on now but just I would like to talk about this because of how quickly they released the phone and it's pretty much a bad day for Samsung pretty much as a bad day as when the note 7 caught fire something like that pretty much but if you're excited for this video then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all of the Apple news and a bunch more like this yeah let's get into it so you've heard that the phone has many issues I wouldn't say it's just one issue there's a couple of issues that have been going on here and to say the least the phone isn't really that safe to recommend to anyone for the high price at two thousand dollars so you might have seen some videos by some reviewers like I saw the one by Casey nice dad and so on so many people got the phone to review it many said that it was cool but there were a couple which actually said that some issues appeared rather quickly when using the phone for a couple of days one of the main issues that I see here and even Casey Neistat mentioned that and as many other where that after just a few folds the phone would get a crease down the screen which which Samsung didn't say would happen so something here is not going right to say the least for example dieter bone from the verge had his phone broken and had a line down the screen on the display which shouldn't happen of course then we had mark Garmin and Marquez their screen protector was peeling off basically a thin layer which would then cause the phone to do some weird things and that was not supposed to happen either so not very good there either and some other people just had the screen flicker for no apparent reason and just do weird stuff as well so not really cool I would pretty much just say that the phone was released way too early and of course I have in mind that this is the first product of this type so like the first foldable device by Samsung and pretty much I think in the world actually it's it's one of the few or maybe the first that actually can fold and I would say that Samsung knew about all the issues that were going on so like they had to see the crease form when folding they had to see that if you slightly peeled off the screen protector the phone would just start breaking and I think that this product is going actually in the wrong direction kind of a bad direction so I think it deserves to be talked about for example I'm really a person that uses many Apple products and I would have done the same to be honest if Apple did something like this I would have been the first one to comment and just criticize what happened there so it's not just because I love Apple that I'm gonna criticize Samsung that's not that for example the iPhone 6 it could Bend really easily that was discovered but I wasn't doing videos back then but I would have talked about it back then if I did videos now I would I don't think there's an excuse here there's absolutely no excuse here and to just have fun here another reviewer said that one screen one side of the screen works faster and refreshes faster than the other which creates a weird effect we're just not supposed to happen on a screen that's supposed to be the same scream just foldable I I would say that this Samsung was really trying to compete Abby Haines two away who are we supposed to release their foldable phone shortly and Samsung probably was just like well we're gonna cut corners here and just release the product and probably just like rip off some people in the process and just take $2,000 per phone that's what it seems like don't get me wrong but that's what I feel that it is you know this phone is not released yet only some people got review samples and it's supposed to be released within a week or so or in about a week and I don't think that's gonna happen or if it does not many people are actually gonna go spend $2,000 unless they're unless they have so much money in the two thousand dollars just nothing and yeah I have a foldable phone I don't think it's gonna be very very successful so we we shouldn't be talking just about the issues some people said some reviewers said that the phone is great it has been working for them there's no visible signs of any problems but they may occur later on but for now only a couple of phones are broken so that maybe some protection issues or that maybe the whole overall phone problem but you never know to be honest but overall many many phones have issues now and either creasy's either the phone is flickering for no apparent reason or the screen protector is peeling off so bad stuff but I would like to know what you think about this and just tell me what you think Samsung did here again as with the note 7 what what did they do here that it's just do you think they cut corners and it's just basically released it to be the first one let me know that in the comments down below well for me this looks like an unfinished product and for the many phones that Samsung's makes that are really good this one is a problem to say the least and I don't really like bitching about all these kind of things but this had to be addressed well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all of the latest Apple news and stuff like this that I don't really like talking about because I really love tech and this was something that was cool but not yet finished or are ready to be released okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
