all right hello guys how are you today there is another video I'm holding the 60 in my hand right now but today we're going to be recording the 60 manual settings video and I wanted to take you behind the scenes just to show you how everything works and what I basically have here set to see the setup it's just here in the back here this brief show and then I'm gonna show you what completely inside so I'll have this camera here what's going to be showing what I'm doing here with the 6d and that I'm going to actually see on the iPad over there so this way everything that I do I can see and it's a really good setup but then I'm going to have the 6d over there on that tripod just to record my face and then I'm just going to be moving it around that's the plan and then as you can see we have these lights here what I'm going to go more into detail now so I have this one this one and this one up here from and or this is like the powerful lights that I have and here what I like about these lights is that you have all these switches would basically make you will allow you to put different light bulbs on so that's really good about this and if I show you inside it's going to be super bright there the light bulb there's five of them and it's the only two of them are on now that's the same thing in this one in this one except this one's like the newest thing that it's like the top lamp but I just have a fire extinguisher there holding it because I did not find any kind of weight because they don't even give you any kind of weight so this is the ghetto setup for the top light and you can also have you have the buttons up there then this one and that one over there these are like the two of my out the oldest lights which are just like one light bulb inside and they just turn on one so they make the same amount of light whenever you just turn them on so that's example then this is the background here that's white on just these kind of holders so that's the background you see from the from the camera is gonna be put over there and I really like the white one because it really goes well with the white light so it makes really nice kind of background thing and here we go that's it for this one so I just showed you kind of the setup I'm going to go record the video now I hope you will enjoy that one as well but I hope you enjoyed this one just kind of showing you the setup and what I did here it was really interesting to do and it's different than before so if you enjoyed leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in the next video what's gonna be the stick what's actually gonna be before this one so confusing anyway take care and I'll see you next time
