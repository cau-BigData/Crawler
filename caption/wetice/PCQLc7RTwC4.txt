hello everyone and welcome back to another video Apple just announced the new highly anticipated iPad pro and the new magic keyboard that has a trackpad it has a lighter dual system with a faster processor and they announced a new MacBook Air as well as a new Mac Mini there are so many other things so let's go take a look at all of them the new iPad pro comes with a keyboard that has a track that yes a $300 trackpad and it floats you can adjust it with so many different angles but it's not just your average keyboard the keyboard gives you an additional USB seat board with already existing one on the iPad pro and you finally get backlighting on this keyboard this actually could be the replacement for a computer for many people out there what about you would you get this as your next computer let me know in the comments down below however the keyboard comes out in May while the iPad pro ships under 25th of March looking at the design it looks pretty much identical to the previous iPad pro in size but it is a little heavier on the back there is nothing different besides the two cameras it has two lenses one standard angle and one ultra wide end there is no telephoto lens because Apple decided to put a lidar sensor instead the lighter sensor basically makes the iPad know the distance between the objects and the iPad up to 5 meters indoor and outdoor you are able to scan and see things around you and it will work better with a R this will be particularly great in the measurement absence with this new technology it is set to be even more accurate in the past that would use just the camera which might have given some false measurements the lenses come at 12 megapixels and 10 megapixels respectively but we'll be using the iPad to make pictures and videos I really don't know however there is one interesting thing and that's the audio Apple said there is a new microphone which offers studio quality audio as can be pretty much seen on the new macbook 16 inch macbook pro 16 inch the display is the same as before the liquid Retina display which is basically an excellent LCD display it would have been great to see OLED finally like on the iPhone 11 Pro Series but oh well the processor is an A 12 Z which is better than the a 12 X but we are unsure how much faster it is going to be we don't know much about the CPU but we know that the GPU is eight core so graphics will be crazy the LTE is up to 60% faster even though I also opted to get the Wi-Fi moto and then create a hotspot with my iPhone either way it's up to you but the LTE should be much faster sadly there is no 5g support which either way is rumored to be coming on the iPad pro later this year the Wi-Fi performance is also faster on the new iPad pro but the description was only faster than on the previous iPad pro so we don't really know Apple has also doubled the free storage option from 64 gigabytes to 128 gigabytes which is something they have been doing year after year the new MacBook Air has also been announced starting at $999 the main change on this computer will be the keyboard the keyboards have been horrendous over the past few years but finally it gets the keyboard that is on the new MacBook Pro you are able to get a quad-core Intel i7 on the new MacBook Air and it is not going to be the most powerful computer but it will get schoolwork or work in general done it will also allow you to do a little photo editing and video editing but nothing extreme as can be done on the MacBook Pros the basic storage has also doubled from 128 gigabytes to 256 and you can go up to 2 terabytes if you're a crazy type the Mac Mini has only one change and that's the storage many people were waiting for the new Mac mini but it will be disappointing there are no spec upgrades just more storage from the beginning at the same price instead of 128 gigabytes you get 256 besides all this there are little additions in the store as well there are over 20 new Apple watch bands which will usually get updates to a couple times a year well it seems that we just had the March event will we be getting any new products during the following week well it's unsure Apple already released many products now so probably not but we'll have to see if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you enjoy then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I will see you in my next video [Music] you
