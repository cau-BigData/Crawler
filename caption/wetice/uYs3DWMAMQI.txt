money except trash is piling up yeah that is a problem so what I was thinking of putting a trash thing here let's just put a trash thing here and the road going a small road just for like the trash guys going like this okay then they can access and collect all the trash and stuff okay so what we're gonna do is connect all of this okay like that so now the trash is going to be picked up and it's going to be all okay now I just disconnected these guys from power well it is not so good so let's just connect them back okay that's good now let me see okay so this is good now I put another trash thing so trashed be getting picked up slowly hopefully and and the incinerator we're getting at 6,500 people soon so I guess what we should do we should start moving some people in right just get as many people in as you can and then yeah but then you know when it probably there will be hospital problems and all of this so we have to be really careful how we expand now and also water treatment slow atrocity we're still kinda good and these guys what what did i do here these guys are okay here okay now let's see this is all good okay now our maple heights it's going good the industry is going little hop hop up a little bit so I guess what we could do I'm going to expand a little bit the industry I'm put a map on the road like this let's just expand the industry by a little bit okay by this March something okay and just add on some more industry here that all the people have some places to work right could this all can be industry I'm not gonna be bothered by that so all this can be industry and so cool like this okay so now they should have water okay they can start building and everything's okay yeah that's perfect perfect perfect now people are moving in may be ok they can move in here they have all of space I'll look at this roundabout well there's a lot more traffic now i can tell you when can you upgrade around about road maybe you can oh no I think I just made a mess because around the boat should be one way ok now they're going all one way okay that's what you wanted ok I by the way let me say real quick because just in case I always like to save yes okay so now the traffic's going good yeah they're stopping sometimes because there's like this intersection and stuff so yeah but that's good if I check the traffic maybe yeah it's okay it's good okay so let me see the trash no more problems now they want what is this commercial so what I want to maybe put from unique buildings what if we put to the mall of moderation if I put it like somewhere here um in fact let's put it here yeah let's put it there so this let's see what's this doing a cheapo mall for shopping okay not that people you gotta be kidding that there are dead people now you gotta be kidding me now what is this power line here we need it no let's see not only the power line um now this produces how much 120 now we're having slowly some problems and upcoming 2000 no way that's okay

wind turbine here nice this okay wind turbine over there what should be producing electricity for us um hello ok and let's see another just why oh but they should start pumping a like trusty soon soon enough yeah that's it they like just agree so if I turn time on now they should now the waist the West is only a problem right so what I need to do is just connect there it's not connected okay so but this is one of those hard connections where I have to fold those all the plates ok and now this I cake over on here and it can start pumping some good fresh water Gail now they about they abandoned their house is because they have no water what they find with normal since I did not put a power lane I mean a watcher thing there so that was a slight issue we had but now we are pumping water out pumping dumping stuff so yeah look at this residence wow there's so much of it now these don't have watch also oh wow they're all thirsty okay and let me just put even here in case I clip them there and it's gonna make a mess my god this mullah moderation this is an issue over here this is an issue this traffic problem over here this really is there such traffic only one here yeah that's for sure so I guess what I'm gonna do because everyone is to go through here to exit town so what I'm going to do basically is give them another egg like they can go this way and maybe if I will do something like this that I go here okay and maybe they'll be smart enough and go so what I want this is what we're getting to the point where i want to make kind of this kind of small square areas and also make a good time little road here like that we're basically we can put some shops and this will be kind of like where they can come shop and and do all this stuff they need yeah this is starting to look nice so this is kind of I think like one of those traffic solvers where if I put this kind of small apartment things ok if I do like so ok and I can put more commercial over here around the mall of moderation okay this is good I like Justin mr. good yep we're still good now they have a Follis problem well that's bad for them and they don't have enough workers oh we are having some slight
