alright hello guys and welcome back to another video so today I have two cameras here the 6d that I'm recording this on right now and I'm going to compare a TD and 6d pictures of this mountain here plus of a storm that we captured I don't know couple days ago with the two cameras so I have two equivalent lens's let's say there they have some differences but they're not very different from each other now we're going to be shooting them on 35 and 50 the pictures with an astable ISO range of 100 because it's very sunny today and we're going to display with the aperture of each lens they are also equivalent so let's get into it the 6d mark 2 as you know has 40,000 ISO range on when it is on picture mode now the ATD on the other hand has 16,000 maximum so what at night when you want to take pictures you have less of an ISO range on the ATD as you can see we have iso 100 a perjurer of 4.5 the speed of 1 to 1000 with the exposure on optimal but beware that the ATD is not full frame and it doesn't have a full frame lens either now on the other hand the 6d is full frame with the full frame lens and as you can see on the picture it's on iso 100 as well aperture 4.5 and the speed is 1 to 800 to have the optimal exposure so as you can see there's a difference between the speed but it's gonna be caused by the lens or one of them is not full-frame now we are shooting at the focal length of 35 here are the two results so the first picture 60 second picture a TD now you know that both are at 35 but this is exactly what proves the full frame and not full frame so on the ATD you can see that it's more cropped they are on the same focal length remember that and the 6d since it's full frame it captures the full frame as it as the name says whereas the not fulfill ms like crop so it crops a part of the picture so that's what you see they are the same pictures except one is cropped so we're gonna change up the settings now we're going to go to focal length 50 on both of the cameras let's look at the ATD first as you can see the ISO is the same but the aperture is different it's 5 and that's because the lens as you zoom in someone just have a fixed aperture but some don't so on that lens it increases as you increase the focal length as you can see now it went from 1,000 speed to 800 so now we are on speed 1 to 800 to have the optimal exposure now let's take the 60 as you can see ISO is the same the aperture is the same because of the lens because the lens supports it because on that lens the aperture maximum is 4.5 so it works to have the optimal exposure on the 6d we had to go up on the speed from 800 to 1000 so as you can see they kind of switched between each other but that's because of the lens and the camera combined so that's our discrepancy so here are the resulting pictures a TD 60 as you can see the crop is still the same but the colors are a little bit different but that's due to the lenses or the camera itself so that's just something you have to see but the auto white balance is there so the white balance is not set by me it's just automatic so normally it should be the same now we are on 105 on the both cameras let me talk about the settings so the settings are as they come let's start with the 60 this time the 6 these settings are exactly the same for the surprise completely the same nothing changed speed is the same everything now the ATD on the other hand is a lot different the ISO is the same it's 100 the aperture though is at 5.6 now and it's due to the lens because we're almost at full zoom which is kind of bad the 5.6 now to have the optimal exposure on the ATD we had to go with the speed way down we had to go all the way to 500 so one 500 compared to the 60 that's still at 1 to 1000 so that's a big decrease but that's because the camera cannot needs more light all right so the results are here and they're surprising ATD 60 as you can see they're still craft but it's because of the full-frame not full-frame crop so the ATD needed way more light into the camera and a slower speed take the same picture than the 60 and as you can see the 60 pictures a lot more vibrant lot more color it's just a lot nicer but now let me tell you one thing none of these pictures were color corrected so there's just pure from the camera RAW no color correction whatsoever now we took some pictures a couple days ago as I said at the beginning of some night storm pictures now they're not the best pictures but I might include them in this video to just show you how both cameras perform they had the exact same lenses so it's going to be a good comparison now here's one picture from the ATD and the 60 so I think their results are good now the 6d looks to be more brighter and just kind of more colored but that's obvious so yeah this is good but if you enjoyed this video leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if you want to see more videos like this or you suggest something leave the it down in the comment section and I may do it or may not do it so we'll see but alright take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
