[Music] [Music] behind me you can see this is legally known so we are really arriving soon and let's see the port it should be a really small island with not so many things but really beautiful wood like turquoise water and everything we just saw some dolphins I'm trying to get them on camera but they're around the boat and I think they're eating right now behind me with all of the seagulls and we're going to try to put the GoPro in front so that we capture all vaguely know when you're enjoying it [Music] we pack this B and also just kind of clean the boat a little bit because lately gnomes are right in front of us we're right there well they're not so far they just one hour by boat so also we check the anchor to see if everything was correct and it seems to be good we are about to arrive to Lakeland home we're not so far away now we're just going on Eddie on engine and we should soon the right to a beautiful spot [Music] [Music] [Music] we are just about arriving here it's really nice so far but really hard to get to so many rocks here so we're gonna park our boat and we're good we have a 5 meter [Music] we arrived we are in port we we just like are on an anchor but we're still turning in our hound so I don't know what's happening but we are going to go probably to the beach soon and see what we can find and maybe even eat in the village [Music] we just got the dinghy ready it's really small for three people we're going to try to get into it and go to the restaurant or somewhere to the port I don't know where we're going and let's survive I'm putting the GoPro in the back so no footage from that but I'll be back and we arrive to the island without getting to it actually yeah not wet so that's fine let's go find the restaurant [Music] this is a really nice place especially this kind of Bay over here I'm impressed it's really beautiful this island is worth coming all the way here we are basically charging things here in the bar that goes in the boat it's just a nightmare so we're just plugging all this stuff here and there and after dinner we're just having some ice cream and we're going to go take the dinghy back go to the boat and that's the end so too tight yep next episode [Music] [Music]
