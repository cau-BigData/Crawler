hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some interesting things over here that I just ordered from this website called you Jim something like that these are smart wearable devices smartwatches actually let me show you here so we've got this SmartWatch here another SmartWatch these are apparently just kind of cool and they're like pretty much Apple watches but not Apple watches you also need an Android phone with it let's just get into this unboxing I have my knife here but I'll probably not need it so let's just start with this kind of wooden box looking SmartWatch alright so let's just get into it well simple unboxing like it's the dumbest thing ever you just literally take this out you destroy the paper not really then um you have the watch here which is ginormous there we go here is the watch and then we've got a cable and a Chinese instruction manual the Chinese instruction manual is actually in English and it's written with such small letters that you can probably not even read them on the camera but here it is here is the SmartWatch now I am really looking forward to on so I'm not gonna unpeel anything but if we look at it structurally it's pretty cool like the band's has a kind of similar feel to like the Apple aaj ish the screen though I hope you can see like this is not borderless it's just like okay anyway it's not powering on but we've got this handy dandy cable which is literally like I don't even know how long is this how long is this thing oh and also one more thing I did some research before to like charge the thing you have to actually plug it in and like the thing is stupid that's like you have to open that up there we go I opened it up yeah so you probably screwdriver to open it um standard Android cable though so you plug that in let's continue with the unboxing so we've got the second wearable smart device simple unboxing as well now oh yeah I was lecture reading this letter and it's really hilarious the English is super cool so like step one please charger the SmartWatch a full night before use so we've got a phone user guide safety oh okay a similar unboxing and this one's actually different so can you see the thickness of this compared to like this it's hmm we need to charger this one as well a full night but yeah well this was a lot of fun unboxing these two hilariously hilarious things with very microscopic cables and very thick actually thick watch is like yeah but anyway this is it for now I have to charger these for all night so I'm gonna come back with like everything later on once everything is settled and stuff but just one more quick peek at what this desk looks like after an unboxing it's there's so much crap anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more and I will see you next time bye [Music] you
