hey guys and welcome to another episode of cities skylines so as you know last episode was like one week ago so let's get back into city skyline you know I've been gone this like last weekend we were I had some videos on my channel so be sure to check them out so yeah but let's just get into the game let's just turn on back the time make some speed and let's see what you can do so our residential demand is quite high so I guess we can make extend the residential zone maybe like so something here let's put it over like so okay and let's put some residential in okay now water there'll be thirsty let's just add some water over here like so now where are we losing money it's like we're not losing money but I see going down or up I yea it's going on okay cool so it's again raining it's a nice day here now these guys need workers so they're gonna have workers shortly because we have some people moving in but also we have some commercial so today we are going to do something special because let me see so we are here like so there's a like I mean like watcher here uh-huh okay so this is our kind of land for now but what I would like to do we don't have unlocked these roads yet okay let's wait until get the pretty roads and all of that that will be a lot nicer now we have some crime here crime rate is high oh yeah because we don't have a police department mm-hmm so if I'll put it here how much is it per for whatever per week for 80 per week I guess we have that money if I put it like here okay let's just put it here okay now that's good so the crime rate goes down okay yeah gel capacity 20 crime rate twenty percent okay oh yeah I just closed something so tiny town what do we have gravel path pavement path okay uchannel I did not even look into all these flood wall new buildings with some parks a Japanese garden now canals on the small that can also be used to regulate water flow and deeper canals by a bus ba ba ba okay so these are to take some water where we're going to check all that later because I don't really understand what's going on over there but we'll see now our industry is starting to go up now we have districts so we are going to delete kind of like remove this kind of crappy polluted place it's kind of disgusting right so what we're going to do I'm going to get a small road here going like so and all the way here right now let's do to kind of lanes let's just like this that's too close get like that oh yeah that's good enough okay like that and what we are going to do all this is basically going to the industry but it's going to be specialized in something right so it's going to be specialized like we have some forests here so maybe forestry I guess and let's just paint all of this because eventually all this will be forestry because we're gonna be expanding and all that right okay let's just do that and what we're going to do here is a slightly increase his record natural resource let's just put forestry okay so forestry now all these people will basically move out now because they don't like it here it's not for them but now new kind of better stuff better industry will come and move in here so that's what we need right okay now the money is going down of course that's normal because I have it under control we have to just get some some industry going here and we're gonna be okay so let's just put some water here okay so people are building here now we need to kind of speed the time up a little bit because where you're gonna run out of money quickly but once these guys what's this for example original wood products that's good except they say our electricity consumption will go up but that's not a big problem we can always you know what's this okay so what if I the terrain now this is what shift terrain level terrain softened and slope now we have events okay we that's what we have to look into an what's this okay so we can put rocks and all of these okay i watch restructure never understood waterfront a nice finish okay we're really going to go look into that later but not today but that's some interesting stuff I really really like it okay a building is burned down oh let's just bored I'll get them fired apart we don't have you're gonna have a party department now the money is not so good yet but what I want to do with my testing if i put the taxes to thirteen percent nothing will happen and we're gonna get some more money so that's triggered a 13-percent on all of them no one will see nothing and that's perfect that to get us some money going now these are now these are good and moving in okay I saw that already so we need still some people to move in that we can get some other structures and all that but we have our residents here it's not so good because buildings are turning down and all of that but we can put a thing the fire department here to secure it forty-seven percent okay well we lowered it quite a lot so I'm happy with that now firefighters will come over here as you can see hello whoops save will they save the house probably oh yeah they did okay let it that's good there are six teens in this house okay and they are uneducated well logically because we have no schools with low happiness of course they'd want parts but let's not just bother with parts yet but we just add another Road here now of course I'm gonna break the power grid and that's gonna cause problems maybe potentially with watcher because that's what's basically there I can't um let me just d zone uh no no because we need to put also some some shops now these have it just ok now why are we losing people that's interesting since I just build more places ok and let's add watcher here there we go cool let's see now we need more shops and shops should be near here so this were gonna tease on because there should be no residential here this should be all shops okay all this will be shops for now now this no fluid would remove the whole thing and that we don't want oh just move out okay that's cool now we're gonna have some some shops here and that's gonna be cool this goes down and now industries going up but they have a lot of place to where they can yeah okay that's good there we go to finish that okay so they have place where they can be so that's okay now let me just see the traffic here so the traffic is good for now but who have probably problems with traffic later on I I know it because here it's like a small road and once we have more buildings and more traffic it's gonna be quite a mess so we're going to see what we're gonna do with that but let me see the watching clothes that the water is good we're good on that now electricity yeah that's that's still good but probably where to do something with a little action now we can remove this power line whoops I just broke something did I just break the road yeah I did okay no one saw that so let's just do that okay now that should be good now one house will have power line in his backyard but technically I could just remove this right yeah I could do that and it's still connected to the grid so that's good whoops now we're gaining people but still they want more residence but let me just build one more and then I would want to build somewhere else because this is really like the entrance off of the place so I would really want to go somewhere else I'll to further because residents can be a little further out it doesn't need to be right here I right here right i was thinkin like we have this land here right like it'll be nice if we can do some here well by the way is there like a limit on lands I think it's three by three right yeah I think it's three by three so I think there's a mod where you can like expand a little more I will see depends on how this theory goes if we're going to add this modern not but i think if i could buy this piece of land then i could have some nice residents here so how much is 5,000 yeah no problem let's just purchase it okay now we have our lands here okay we have this part and this part we have a highway running through here and a train but water hello oh yeah they're thirsty they complain right when they come okay well now they have watcher okay now these guys I know what I was sick citizens are sick okay well only 15 citizens are sick so I guess like if I put a medical clinic here how much is a medical clinic 400 we can do that so just put a medical clinic here now health capacity 100 average health fifty-six percent now they're gonna transport them so there okay there okay no problem here okay now our industry is going good except shops more shops we need more shops okay so let's just probably maybe oh this is the border here okay so what I'm going to do um we're gonna we need to have shops near the entrance because they need to bring goods to them and if they don't receive good then we have a problem with money and all of that so yeah we need to keep them here at the entrance of the city and what we need to do also early on i think i will need to do this okay i will need to upgrade the road here there cannot upgrade because there's something right space already occupied by what what do we have here so important Oh of fire department what I need to do now this would be a slight issue here because I've removed many places and I disconnected from the power grid yay well start moving in or it's gonna be a problem start moving in here okay well I have to do that to set the city and they are thirsty here what's logical so let's just do that like so it's not the most efficient but you know what okay it's good now hmm our money went down really quickly we're like 4,000 and i expanded some roads and it's a mess immediately so I just upgrade all this I know I'm gonna make a huge mess but this is a must and also a must is that some shops start moving in because otherwise he probably let's just do that for now okay like soap now don't know where is like here shops will move in here how is it called like you know commercial will move in here and we'll have good yeah now more residential so we were talking about putting some residential zones here right what doesn't sound like a bad idea but we have problem with the road how they're gonna come here and all that so i guess for now let's just stay there okay here we'll have our industry all over here building has burned down okay um well i'm sorry but what can i do now yeah there's no fire safety here so yeah that's an issue but whatever for now now i would want to do a last thing I would want to put the road here another or technically I could just do this okay connect I want it straight ok so i guess just expand i guess and then just connect them up ok and just do this you know today I've kind of Road it's kind of nice separated and all that and now here whoops mother just don't put commercial there that's some residential here and now what we gonna do we're gonna expand this out like so there and like this it's gonna be nice here this would be kind of like our small residential zone and then I would want to do some interesting residential zones later on over there okay but for now we need some residents in here so they'll have it water of course not of course not so let's just put this here that we have it set up for all the people that want to move in here why so boom ok so now more residence is moving in now the money is up through but these guys don't have enough workers am I right or customers don't have workers yeah and we need to also put some education in this city because no education here I guess what we could do just you know put the elementary school here just to educate some guys of course we don't have enough as I put a school more people eligible okay well let's put what's the power problem here okay well we are using more electricity than we probably sing so logically that's a problem but let me just you know just crank the what you know the electricity and that should produce more I guess yeah well we're safe I think we'll have to put another coal power plant well play power plant but we'll see about that but let's see if I because it's like affecting much boomtown what do we have recycling with all this and we have a cemetery so people start dying from now Oh advanced wind turbine a bus depot okay what's the next visit down and we get I think we get yeah this ninu nice roads and some buildings we get the oil power plant that's important and also be a hospital and all that that's going to be important for us but I think we still have the power problem right yeah so what I'm gonna do for now just yeah go up go up okay and we're producing yeah i think i'll have to put another one but we're gonna see about that later and let me just see this power line here let me just put out a trustee and yeah we're gonna remove this because this is kind of pointless here uh oh yeah well okay and remove this it looks nicer and this one is ok it's connected cool that's good ok yeah but I tell you what guys I hope you enjoyed this episode if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe really helps me out and next episode we're probably going to try to fix this fire problem over here because that starting to cause too many fires in the force base so but anyway guys until next time take care and I'll see you in the episode
