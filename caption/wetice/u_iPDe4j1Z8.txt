hello everyone and welcome back to another video we have some new information about the upcoming iPhone 12 and Apple is planning some big things the redesign could be bigger than we all expected and the iPhone se might come in two sizes Apple is also working on a gaming Mac and maybe a product red series 5 Apple watch whoo that's a lot to cover in this video so go get some popcorn and get ready let's start with the iPhone 12 we already know how it might look but sources aren't saying the same thing about the knotch some say it will remain but a new source is saying that there will be no more notch and no more face ID would just touch ID being reintroduced Bloomberg and Ming Chico both said that there would be faced ID and touch ID which just adds to the confusion they also said that the selfie camera would be in the screen but this would only be available on the highest-end models of the iPhone 12 however this was previously a rumored for 2021 but now there are talks about it in 2020 every single part of this phone will be tweaked in one way or another Apple is tweaking the new back by adding new stainless steel borders reintroducing the iPhone 4s design a new stabilization for system for the lenses and new screen sizes going from five point four to six point seven inches another source says that they are removing a layer from the 120 Hertz screen so that they can directly put the components on the screen all this could mean that we will get a thinner and more power efficient phone with an amazing 120 Hertz OLED screen also a B were that there might be a 50 to $100 increase in the iPhone 12 Pro Series regarding the processor it will most likely go down from 7 nanometers to 5 nanometer and will most likely be the a14 the chip will be smaller which will hopefully lead to more power efficiency and higher performance with the more efficient screen the more efficient processor and the more efficient battery management component we might see a significant increase in battery life and battery size so we should be getting four new iPhones right well not so fast a new report is saying that we should be seeing two new iPhone models this year of course we know that one of them will be the iPhone se 2 or the iPhone 9 more about that by clicking the card shown up here but the second one can be an iPhone se 2 + or iPhone 9 + by definition the iPhone se 2 will be an upgraded version of the iPhone 8 so it would make sense to have a plus version so this would be a total of 6 new iPhones to choose from this year wow that's a lot of phones you might already know that Apple has a hard time selling Mac's to gamers so they might just change that by default you can't do much gaming on a Mac unless you have a super-powerful Mac and spend way too much money Mac's generally have been made for productivity editing picture editing and artists and all of these they never really touched the gaming market but this could change in 2020 this might also change in June of 2020 during WWDC where a computer specifically for gaming will be made but we have no information about the design or specs just yet finally we could be seeing a product red Apple watch as soon as spring of this year the source also tries to show us how the watch might look in a reddish color Apple never sold or manufactured a red Apple watch so it would be a first the only product they sold was a red watch band as part of the product red but it'll be really cool to have a red watch as well it could be coming early spring so if you really want to read watch and now's the time wait a few more months well this is the end of this video I hope it wasn't too long and too much information if it was then please let me know in the comments down below please don't forget to leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out so much and yeah just so much also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown in the corner up here okay take care and I'll see in my next video bye [Music] you
