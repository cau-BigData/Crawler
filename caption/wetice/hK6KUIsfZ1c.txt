hello everyone and welcome back to another video Apple released I was 13 point 4 beta 2 2 weeks after beta 1 we are going to take a look at the new features and changes the performance battery life and some bugs that were in beta 1 and now in beta 2 also the public beta should be getting this update within the next day if it isn't already released by the time this video post it watch always six point three point one was also released today to the public so we're gonna take a look at that one at the end of the video so the update size on my iPhone 11 pro max is about 460 megabytes coming from beta 1 this will vary of course depending on which device you have and from which software version you're coming from let's go over into Settings General and about section click here as you can see we're running thirteen point four we are at the build number 17 5 2 3 3G the update has progressed a lot so we should be seeing many bug fixes here now if we go down to the modem from where we can see that we went from 1.0 5.23 to 1.0 5.25 in beta 2 if you had any connectivity issues these should be fixed in these beta now what about the features and changes so the mail app has some changes so as you can see the bar down here the toolbar has been changed multiple times as you can see in the previous beta we had this icon over here compared to now having it here and then the compose button here so basically the flag went away within the betas in iOS 13.4 beta 1 when using the mouse with your iPad pro there would be kind of a stutter but now it is even more seamless than before now many people reported that the Settings app would be very buggy and would crash by itself which for me was not the case but many people reported this one and I haven't had this issue it seems not to happen in beta 2 so it should be fixed now what about the bugs well notifications attacking in beta 1 would be extremely bad and basically they would not stack as they were supposed to which which is quite bad now it seems to be fixed I hadn't had this issue again the Instagram audio bug is still present so for those that don't know the Instagram back bug basically means that you play a video on Instagram go out of the app and go to a different app for example but the video the audio would still be playing in the background and you could not get rid of it this bug is still present here I tested it out to see if it's gone but it's still here so Apple has to fix this one so one bug that I really experienced and many people talked about as well is when you would have let's say the badge with an amount of emails mine is extremely high don't mind that but if you'd see that sometimes the email that actually came into your mailbox at least what it says the badge would not be there so the mail app would bug out and many people had this issue in beta 1 but it is too early to say if it's still in beta 2 as I didn't have enough time to test it out one bug similar to this was in the Safari app so if you opened it you wanted to load something it would not load at first so you'd have to exit out completely and then go back into safari and it reload and then you could also refresh as much as you wanted it would then work but this was very annoying and I experienced this one throughout beta 1 and in beta 2 it seems to be fixed as you could see now what about the performance and battery life so performance is very good on beta 1 and on beta 2 it seems to be about the same I'm not having any lag or stutter or the animations are smooth as well so it seems that this performance here is quite solid now regarding battery life we're over into the battery life section we can see that the battery life is quite good so if I go over the last 10 days it depends on the battery usage but the phone got me through more than one day if we consider 100% so it of course depends on the usage but the battery life was very good so I wouldn't expect it to change in beta 2 now washer Wes 6.1.3 was released today to the public so you can go install that on your watch if you have an Apple watch they fix some buzz than the watch included the they fixed an issue that prevented the irregular heart rhythm notification from working as expected for Apple watch owners in Iceland so if you're a nice line then this bug should be fixed but that's not only the one it came at about fifty megabytes for me but that can vary and there are some performance and battery life improvements as well as some security improvements as well now should you update to iOS thirteen point four beta two if you are on beta one then you should definitely update for all the bug fixes and maybe some performance but that's unclear just yet if you are in thirteen point three or below then don't until a few betas later or when the software will get more stable or when it's released for the public so just stay safe don't install anything on your daily driver that can cause a lot of issues if you have a secondary phone then why not do it there so you can play around with what's new but otherwise just stick to thirteen point three unless you're on thirteen point four beta one well this is the end of the video
