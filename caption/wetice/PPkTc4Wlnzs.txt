what's up guys last Friday Apple shipped the iPhones to the people that pre-order and made it available for purchase to everyone however what got me thinking is what Apple wrote in the email the fastest chip ever in a smartphone we know that the a13 is indeed the fastest one in the iPhone but does it perform the same or better than the iPhone eleven Promax with the same chip let's start with the specs to see what we are looking at both devices have the a13 Bionic chip which was first seen in the iPhone 11:11 pro series late last year but the iPhone se has only three gigabytes of RAM compared to the iPhone 11 Pro maxes 4 gigabytes of RAM this will definitely play a big role in the speeds but let's see how much it really affects the performance of course the other factors don't really matter my two devices have different storage options different displays and different features but we will be purely looking at the aspect of performance so these don't really matter before we do the test I am running both devices on the latest beta of iOS 13 point four point five and they have the same build number as well as the same modem firmware so keep that in mind we will be testing the devices in three categories benchmarks using Geekbench actual usage and how it feels and video processing because both phones have the same GPU so over in gig bench we can really see that were running the same processors so all of this is really important here now the results are very interesting the iPhone 11 pro max has an average single score of 1330 and the iPhone se has an average of the CPU processing of 1320 so the average here is very similar on both iPhones however what a surprising is on the multi scores so for example the iPhone 11 pro has about 3450 average out of the three tests I ran and the iPhone se has about a 2600 average from the three tests I ran here so this is really interesting to see the single core score on the iPhone se and 11pro Macs were very similar except when it came to multi-core performance the best explanation would probably be heat management the surface of the iPhone se isn't that big as the one of the 11pro Macs so maybe Apple had to reduce the peak speeds to manage this issue when testing the GPU we can see that the results are really interesting as well the iPhone 11 pro max averages around 6300 in the score based on the three tests I ran and on the iPhone se the average is around 6200 so again the iPhone 11 pro max is winning here by combining both results of course the iPhone 11 pro max comes on top but by only a few percent so you are essentially paying 70% more for the 11pro max and getting only a few percent more in performance further if you remember the iPhone 11 pro max has an extra gigabyte of RAM which probably explains the slightly higher performance the next test is the day to day usage when using both phones I didn't really notice a significant difference but the only reason why I would say that se is a little slower is because it still uses the interface that really includes the home button the differences have nothing to do with the processor or the hardware it's just the user I am so used to face ID and swiping up that the home button just slows me down in many tasks another test is with video editing directly on your device I took a three minute video at 4k 60 frames per second on both devices the goal here was to cut the video in half and export it as a new clip the iPhone 11 pro max processed the video in approximately 10 seconds compared to the iPhone se that processed it in about 9 in seconds so you can definitely see that the iPhone 11 pro max has faster processing here compared to the iPhone se alright these are the speed tests that I feel like are the most important for anyone I was really surprised about the difference in speeds of these two devices they are running the same processor which to me sounded like the exact same performance except then if you take into account that the iPhone se is missing one gigabyte of RAM and it's probably running slower to reduce the heat either way we can see that having the same processor doesn't mean that the performance will be exactly the same well the price is only $400 which makes it a very competitive iPhone that many people will find worthy to upgrade to of course the performance is not going to be the same as on the iPhone 11 pro max but for day-to-day activities that iPhone se works perfectly if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video follow me over on Twitter for more recent updates and some fun stuff also if you missed like previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you
