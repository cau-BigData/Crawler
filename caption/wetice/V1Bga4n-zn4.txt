hello guys welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about some apple iOS 13 rumors and some of the rumoured features that have been appearing on internet and also some of my wishes for new features so let's just cover all of that in this video first of all we will be seeing a lot of features in iOS 13 because it's supposed to be a very big feature oriented release however if you look for at the past iOS 11 was a big feature update from iOS 10 but iOS 12 wasn't really a big feature oriented update it was just purely a bug fix update which was a very good idea because there were many bugs and iOS 11 was not perfect so iowa's 12 kind of covered all of that and Apple put iOS 13 on hold so that they could cover and fix all the bugs but now we really need new features we really want new features here because iPhones and iPads have been the same for quite some time now and it's time to add some features let's talk about the release date well developers betas in public betas will start coming with in June and developers betas will probably come just after WWDC which is a show held by Apple which talks about all these kind of things which is very interesting and we'll see what they bring and then the official release date should be a few months later in September usually the third week of September ish that's when it happens usually but we don't know that for sure what is my wish list for the features for iOS 13 well I would really love to get dark mode so dark mode has been present on the max which is super amazing everything is just better for your eyes and I just love dark mode this is one of the most asked feature actually what I was impressed and you know right now in iPhones there is kind of like a smart invert type of thing but it doesn't really do the work as dark mode dark mode is really specific however it'll be also good in iPhones to have dark mode because battery life would be better the pixels would not have to be illuminated so much it'll just be a black screen pretty much so it'll be way better from battery life globally one thing that I would love to change is the phone call UI the phone call UI is kind of old now it's been here for such a long time having the green button and the red button to show like pick up hang up but you don't really want to hang up at some point you just want to ignore the call which is kind of annoying when it fills the screen and you cannot really do anything about it until the phone call the other person stops calling you so it'll be great to have some kind of minimize option by just swiping or just that the code would show up while you're on your phone on top or on the bottom or on the side or just like an icon that'll be really good like it'll ring mucho and I can if you don't want to pick up don't pick up just swipe away but it will not hang up it'll just ignore the call for the time being another thing is the volume HUD the HUD that's really annoying that's something that really annoys me on the iPhones and iPads forty mark that's one thing it really annoys me is the volume HUD which basically is always in the middle of the screen which gets pretty annoying almost always you're watching YouTube video this big box shows up in middle of the screen it's really annoying and and you don't really want to adjust the volume too much because it stays there for like a couple seconds it really annoying but it'll be great as well to have it on top on the bottom like YouTube has it for example that it's on top it's like a bar on top that'll be pretty great picture-in-picture p IP would be amazing because that's something that we have on the ipad where if you're watching something on safari for example and you close out minimize on the bottom and then you could go back in so you could be watching something on on internet while looking at your emails for example that would be really good and since the phones are getting bigger now it would be fine having picture-in-picture I understand that in the past it was not possible because of the smaller screen sizes but now that's something that would really be possible to do and it would be a great feature to have well these are the big ones that I really wanted to mention because this are some features that many people want and that's something I really wants as well but they I have a bunch of other features on my wish list that hopefully will be implemented in iOS 13 that would be great and we'll have a lot of features to talk about and I'll keep you informed about all of those now let's talk about the rumors that have been floating around for the past couple weeks or so now iowa's 13 should really be a performance focus bloated with features which is a great combination now many rumors state that it's gonna be iPad focus but I believe and many people believe that it's still going to bring many features to the iPhone as well as the iPad now the iPad should have an updated file app tabs and apps out side by side a home screen redesign and home screen redesign is rumored to be also on the iPhones so all that would be really good to have it'll be amazing but on the iPhone we should have a home screen your design which will be amazing because the app icons have been here for such a long time and they can do something really interesting I'm just hoping they're not gonna do something like Androids doing by having widgets on the front because that's really annoying it I don't really like that but we'll see what they will do maybe they're gonna go from the flat image to like a 3d image or something like that I don't know well that's pretty much it for now of rumors but I'm gonna make more videos as more rumors to popping up and I'll keep you updated on everything opening when I was 13 I was 12 right now and well yeah well anyway I'm super excited for the iOS 13 it's coming in about five months which is super exciting and we're gonna see we're gonna see we have to wait let's make some rumor videos and let's just get excited but anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future so be
