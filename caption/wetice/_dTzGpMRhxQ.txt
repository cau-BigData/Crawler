hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 13 beta 6 to the registered developers just nine days after the release of beta 5 but if you are in the public beta you should be receiving beta 5 shortly probably today or tomorrow beta 5 was a huge update in terms of everything that came into iOS 13 here I have the iPad pro with beta 6 of iPad or West and I have beta 6 on the iPhone we're gonna look at both of these devices so the first thing we have to look at is that this update came at about 579 megabytes on my iPhone XS coming from beta 5 now of course the update size varies a lot depending on which device you're gonna be using but it it's just around this number now let's go look at the build number so if you go into settings general About section and we go over here software version click on 13 we can see that we're running 17 a 55 5 6 D as you can see there's a D at the end but it doesn't signify anything much but the number didn't change that much from beta 5 now also if you scroll down a little lower we're gonna see that the modem firmware has been updated from 1.50 4.04 all the way to two point zero zero zero one this should help massively with connectivity issues and any issues like that if you've been having any now one thing they noticed immediately as I got into my phone and started listening some music is that the volume is actually moving way quicker than in the past so now there's only 16 intervals whereas in the past in beta 5 there were 32 so you would have more volume control than you have now so you know you're listening to some cool music and you just want to bump it up a little bit but not go double I mean you know like a double interval as they're 16 and 32 in the past so it was great to have a lot of a lot more control whereas now you only have those 16 intervals now there's new toggles in the control center so if you head over into settings control center customize controls we see right over here that we have a new control called dark appearance so if we add that it's very simple it probably know what it does already control center you basically can toggle between dark appearance and light appearance so that's what you can toggle with right from your control center which is cool to have this kind of type of thing now in photos if we go into photos you can actually now peek and pop on a photo right this way so if you have a photo you want a peek and pop and look at directly you can just click on it I mean prolong press on it and you can see everything you need now some bugs that I want to show you so first one is if you go into settings you go into wallpaper some people see that the dynamic wallpaper choice is pretty much empty so you have these dark grey thumbnails and just the white thumbnail on the front which is quite unfortunate this dynamic wallpapers at one of the ones I like now one thing that is in the mail there was a bug in beta 5 where basically you would not be able to see that the mailbox updated down here but you could only see it right over here which is quite unfortunate another one was in settings when you went to notifications and when you wanted Siri to actually talk to you into your air pods well that's missing for me in beta 6 it was also missing in beta 5 but some people miss it in beta 6 like me for example now the performance on beta 5 was very good for me I loved it beta 6 seems to have the same performance it is super smooth super fast but of course it's early to say if I actually don't find anything wrong with it I will be testing it a lot this week and I'll come back with a video explaining everything about this update later on once I've had some time to play around with this update now there were a lot of app crashes in beta 5 which I did not really like but now I try to go to the app that we're crashing like Spotify used to do some weird stuff in the app where it basically if you closed it and when to do something else then it would stop playing the music kind of like YouTube which was really annoying but YouTube of course they want you to pay for a premium feature but this was really something that I did not like now if we go back into settings and go check the battery life battery for me is overall quite good but it could be a really better I saw that there the Bachelet doesn't last as long as before before I use up the whole battery level so I'm not really happy about that but in beta 6 it already feels like I got the beta 6 this morning it's currently 2:30 p.m. and it already feels like I have more battery than before so maybe beta 6 fixed it but I will be testing this and I'll let you know what I found out after a little while now let's go take a look at the iPad so this is the iPad pro if some of you have this this is an excellent iPad I love it so so much but on the iPad there is beta 6 on this one I really really love it so much but there isn't that much that's new actually pretty much everything that was updated on the iPhone came to the iPad so nothing to report over here but of course if I find anything else I will be the first one to come and tell you all about it but for now I didn't find anything special well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this in the future also if you
