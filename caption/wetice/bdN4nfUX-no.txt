hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so it's a 20th and I see this is the sixth day or something like that up daily videos I don't really remember what I'm doing right here but as you can see you probably even here's I'm not using my microphone but I'm recording on the g7x I don't want to keep it lonely or anything because i've been using the 100 d a lot now for almost all of these daily video and i decided that i would kind of take out the g7x will do it for a ride and just kind of play with it a little bit but don't want to keep it like lonely and away from me because it served me a lot until I really started playing with the 100 d and it's working out for me a lot better than this morn camera oh yeah today I would want to do something a little bit different than I do usually but since I want to do this daily videos I have to come up with crazy ideas and stuff and today and request it all from twitter i'm going to kind of show around my setup so i remember that i did a set of video way back long time ago probably couple months even maybe half a year ago i did to set up video and it changed a lot because the function of my setup change the law and it changed and it's a lot a lot functional and has many functions to it now one thing that i was going to say what is probably my favorite part of the whole setup if this basically this wall behind me I think it is last summer and it's great I do know those maybe it looks white in the video or something but it's great and it's a great wall for a bright background behind me that I can record the videos and it kind of looks a lot better than with shelf with a globe on top of it like you not see any videos from there but yeah that's what I do now yeah as i said i'm going to show around my setup and and just kind of explain around how it looks at how we work alright so i went ahead and touch my stick because Bobby's while struggling in firstly first one could be a lot easier right now and it maybe even a little bit more stable but we're going to start from like the back side so if I come so this is basically the whole place you see in each video that's the wall there that's do all behind that you see on standards the famous chair and this is kind of down here nothing crap so yeah now I have this camera over here ok this is the 100 d with its official lens because I thought I don't need anything special for these videos and I need to be kind of zoomed in so that's the perfect length for it now i know that i said that i use the microphone what i was using before for recording gaming videos but i have this Rho D Rho the microphone here because you didn't screw up and I don't know how to link up the sound so this way the sound is linked up and everything is working perfectly now it's kind of a mess walking back there because there's so much junk look at this if you look at this there's so much on this cable their seat there's there's just everything a bunch of mess bunch of crap with that bunch of crap it's kind of hard to move around in my room but it works and that's the main point of it anyway now as you can see behind me there are these two gigantic big lamps and these are the only kind of lambs they produce a lot of life and and that makes enough life for all my videos and that way it's all this up and with the 100 e with manual settings I can put it it it's not like kind of grainy and stuff so it works perfectly fine for me another by the way there's a global talking about so if someone wants to cop it on my settings probably not because it's really weird depends on everyone what kind of settings they want to put but these are the settings that work for me perfectly it works good and I can change them easily to do whatever settings i want so it's perfect now if we go back into the main area recording area where the background is looks dozen times better I recently got this little thing so this is an EXO eggs kind of online singing device online yes it's kind of like a high-definition USB external sound card so that's perfect for whenever I need to record with the microphone because this toner or microphone is really has a really low sound so i guess i can boost it and then means i can hide the microphone away from the camera that is not seen as you can see in all of my videos the microphone is measure seen in them so this little thing changes like a life-changer this does everything for me I can change it up and change the settings on it for like the echo and a bunch of crap like that Mike bath and mic volume and Mike treble and here it is in real life so it's kind of flashes like this and it's going to start flashing or red whenever I would come to the microphone like that for you can see it's kind of starts flashing red and as I said you have all of these buttons here my volume might rebel and Mike path to change up and this is kind of the karaoke side your phone volume music volume and so on so that's kind of the karaoke type of style and of course I my red GBL has such here to kind of listen what if the sounds and settings are good now this is how it's going to look from here I have this big screens I showed probably already that's where I do the editing as you can see and that's what I use as a main screen to record and basically what i do i just change display settings to 1920 x 1080 p and if then I recording 1080p using OBS open broadcasters say something yeah and then basically I record on there it works I have obvious on the other side and all that the screen is doing that but I can see what I'm recording I see the microphone volume on that side and I can check everything whenever I'm playing a game or something it's perfect and I recommend having two screens because it's a lot simpler than then if you would have only one so this is how you would see it from my perspective you'll be looking you have the canon 100 be there give these two gigantic light making some light for us and then I'm just looking at the cool hope again as I said and then I have very small webcam when i'm on skype i don't really use this to record videos because it's kind of crappy so it's there just for for skyping and whenever i need to do something small now I have this great sound system here this is like a great sound system with like six secretly no its way yeah about five speakers yep it's kind of a stereo speaker system it's great because it makes good sound when I want to edit it's perfect and now maybe what you've been waiting for this is my editing of future and used to it it and record all of the videos and this I'm going to probably put into a separate video because there's a lot about this and if you did not watch that video i really recommend you to go watch it it was kind of a good video and it puts quite a lot of effort into it now that's going to wrap it up for this video if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below i really enjoyed using the g7x in this video it helped me a lot to move around and stuff so that's perfect so this is my setup and I just really wanted to to requested it so I showed you and that's what I used to record all the video and since i'm recording it Bailey used to be functional and it works oh and by the way I forgot couple things and the cup things are I can actually plug this this is the hdmi kind of connector and it's plugged to my capture card so whatever I want to I can take it to the 100 g and i can record to OBS directly so that's that's perfect so using the capture card i can direct the record 20 beers and I can manage the camera from my bed but I don't use it too much because OBS then puts it on top of like the video so I cannot move it around if you can tell me how then let me know in the comments I don't really know how that's where record is kind of separately and and then how it works so that's the whole set up if you enjoyed leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated and subscribe take leave a nice comment really leave a nice comment and yes take care and I'll see you in my next video you
