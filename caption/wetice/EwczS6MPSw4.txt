hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today today is another awesome day to record a video because today I'm going to talk about something that I haven't done in a while this is going to be a channel update video now I did a channel update like seven or eight months ago so this one is really changed and this one will be a lot of thank you and a lot of and a lot of other things like that and and about the future so I wrote some stuff down of course as I always do and I'm gonna kind of talk about them in a very short way in a short video I don't want to like ramble on for ten minutes in this video I could but I wouldn't I don't want to do that so the first thing I want to talk about is last month I hit over a thousand views in a month what it's like crazy for me it may sound small but it's crazy for me I never thought that I would get to that point in like a year so it's it's amazing I'm very thankful for that I'm already going I'm already like past 1200 views this month what's like amazing that's crazy I never thought I will go past the 1000 but it's happening I've been gaining some subscribers it's amazing I'm very thankful for that all the videos I make get awesome amounts of support so that's amazing that's always great Wow and its really really great and if I should go to my next point I've been upping the quality of my videos and you may notice that from like last September I've been just improving I'm pretty sure because they started like we're making these kind of video last September it's been a year it's been a year almost in one month actually I've learned a lot the past year if I should say and and also the video quality my opinion went up up so and even the video ideas I really do brainstorm more often I really do do like writing down ideas and like cross out the idea that I would have done before but I'll not do now so it's really really a big change for me maybe you don't notice as much but you for sure must notice that there has been a big change with the video content my schedule and everything so pretty sure that changed now point three about my schedule my schedule will stay the same hopefully for this year I'm pretty sure that it's gonna stay like this for like ever because that's like a great schedule for me Monday Wednesday Friday it's awesome to record videos for these days and then during the weekend I are usually recording my videos and I relax so during the week I'm busy but this schedule will hopefully not change and as you know I found this game called geoguessr what basically is an awesome game and I just played once a week usually on Fridays I try to keep that kind of trend going it's the 3rd video that it's going to be published know it's the fourth video on Friday that's gonna be published so I mean it's not a lot of videos yet but I have a lot of fun you guys seem to have fun that videos so that's amazing I really enjoy making videos that you guys enjoy watching so those are really doing great and all the other videos that record aside to the geoguessr videos are also doing great so that's me yeah so I just wanted to kind of talk about this to you guys but I don't usually talk like this to you guys but I have been really thankful for the past few months on my channel has been growing and also my content and ideas I did not like no I'm still in line I still have ideas I'm not taking a break hopefully I'm probably not even gonna take a break because I have many break days between the video that record so it's it's fine I don't need to break yep anyway I usually find in the break every record my videos and I take a break but right now I don't need a break because I'm super excited because I have many ideas and many and I see also that my channel is going in a great way so that's really something to motivate me but anyway guys this will do it for this video if you enjoyed beastly like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it'll be greatly appreciated well not these kind of videos in the future but a channel update I find it quite important to talk because like last time long late I made like you know maybe two people who saw it so I mean it's it's important overall to have a channel update and just to speak about these kind of upcoming things but I don't have any upcoming things yet trips planned but if I do I also should talk about it but yeah this will do it take your leave a like and subscribe probably this video will not persuade you to subscribe but go ahead watch some other videos in my channel there are great videos anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Applause] [Music]
