hello everyone today we will talk about iOS 13 and whether you should install it on your device first off Apple posted this on their website which is very interesting they know that developers are giving their betas to the public but with this thing here they say that it is very buggy and that a public beta will receive it next month the installation process for iOS 13 is in the best I just download and install via my Mac on Mac OS Catalina by the way it is very buggy at the moment it might get stuck and lag a little bit during the process now let's take a look at the pros and cons the vic pro being the new UI experience the connectivity options and easy access the speed and everything seems to be perfect from the outside you have many new wallpapers and you have updated apps now about the cons though your experience seems to be good on top but it is very laggy and has many stutters it is possible to have even some crashes but it is mostly visible in third-party apps which are Anjuli supports it in I was 13 yet the Settings app can just hang up when opening it yeah this is back in iOS 13 and the overall UI experience is fast but laggy and stuttering let's look at the battery life the battery life overall was a little less for me during the day I don't go through the whole day with it which can be a little frustrating for some people who need their battery life the files app in iowa's and iPad OS is kind of working and not working some features don't work but some do exporting is hit or miss you might succeed but then you might not I experienced some car jumping as well on my phone now what is my overall experience I love seeing iOS 13 and the new software overall there are so many features changes dark mode and much more that excites me a lot personally I love all of this but the back parts are just very annoying I would not put this on my daily driver until the public beta is coming later this month well this is the end of the video I would personally not install it on my daily driver but rather on another day vice if you have that option otherwise just wait for a month or so and you can get it with less bugs and less problems if you missed my previous video about all the features in iOS 13 then click in the corner up here also please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these okay take care and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
