hello guys welcome back to another video today I would love to review the Apple smart battery case it's been released about the month ago and I have had it for about two weeks now and I really love this thing let's just talk about how my experience has been for the past two weeks because I've been using it pretty much on a daily basis first of all let's talk about how easy it's to set up so to just slide in your phone you just really bend a little bit and slide it in and then it snaps into place which is very very simple and I thought it would be more complicated than that and to remove it you do the same thing open it up like this and slide the phone out super simple as well to charge this battery case you have two options you can either just plug in a cable charge it by itself and charge your phone separately or while your phone's inside the battery case you can just plug it in here and you can charge both at the same time so that of course is going to take quite a long time because it's gonna start charging the phone very slowly plus the battery case very slowly as well so if you really want to charge very quickly then I would say that you charge both separately now let's talk about how long it can keep up with this battery plus the battery I have in my phone so let's say I have all together they're two hundred percent so one hundred percent in here and one hundred percent in my phone that lasts me about a day and a half or so which is actually better than my I don't know 3/4 of a day so it's it doubled actually my whole battery life which is just really important and really cool to see because when you're traveling you have this it lasts you pretty much the whole trip which is super fun to see and even if you want to plug your headphones which I was concerned about you can plug them into the port as you would on the iPhone and they would still work so this product is really sturdy really solid I have no concerns about the quality of it the grip is very good and also it has a small light that shines when you plug it in that shows you whether red or green red meaning that's charging green meaning that it's charged once you insert the phone into the case it's gonna show you battery of the case and of the phone which is super fun to see because that way you can know how much battery you have and also in the widgets you can set up a widget of battery and you can see how your batteries are doing this one your phone and an Apple watch if you have one so all that is super cool I have been very happy with it it took me every day except one thing well your phone can become quite well quite thick I would say quite thick it sometimes it's a little bit annoying in your pockets but overall you get really used to it and it's not such a pain in the butt as I thought it would be even though it's a little bit heavy because this is pretty much I think the weights of the phone so you're just doubling the whole amount of weight you have so just be ready that it's a little bit thicker a little bit heavier and it's a little bit larger in your hands but all that you can get used to if you're using it on a daily basis and all of the benefits outweigh all of the other issues you may be having or just that it's way too big now one more thing the compatibility it's great so it fits on the iPhone X as well that's been fixed with the iOS update and you can put your X s in here and that's pretty much all these three there are three different models you can get it one for the XS Mac's the XS and the X are so perfect fun to see anyway this is my review on this thing I really enjoyed this product it's super cool to have and I would definitely recommend that you get this even though it's a little bit on the expensive side it's still worth the money if you really need battery life for all day also it's smart so it doesn't over charge your phone which keeps your battery healthy anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated about all the latest Apple news all different kind of bunch of tech and a bunch more anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye you
