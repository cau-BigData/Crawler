hello guys and welcome back to another video so today this video topic is external microphones so as you hear this microphone is from the g7x which is not big it's just small and it's internal in the camera it's not as powerful as this camera over here so that's a very special and this one is big so it provides better audio quality than the one that is internally in the g7x so for this video I'm just going to be comparing the g7x microphone and the rode videomic not the pro just the standard one so these are the one I'm gonna compare now the big thing that you can see that's obvious is that this size let me just remove this the size of the microphone is significantly bigger than the microphone in the g7 X which is just internally and very small this is on top it's a shotgun microphone so as you can see it kind of moves so it absorbs sound then with that the sound masters is very important the video I already posted previously you can check that one out to find out more about that but the audio quality from the rode videomic even this one or the pro I'm not getting the pro because it's way more expensive than this one and I did not see a significant difference in reviews or something like that so that's why I decide to get this one what's probably like a hundred to your like one hundred dollars cheaper this one does everything great except it has a 9-volt battery that you have to change when the microphone guys basically but it usually lasts very long time and you can just get rechargeable ones and that way you can recharge them whenever you need so pretty much this is a really good option there are also microphones that are external that are taking power from the camera which I would not recommend because they would drain the battery from the camera that you already need to power the camera not to power the microphone so that's what I would recommend for example the microphone in the juice neck's it's taking power from the g7x battery so that's it but for example with the g7x what I miss is an external audio jack but then on the other hand I don't know where I'll put the microphone because you have the flip screen on top so it I don't know it has to be complete redesign or have them screen turn the other way to the side like like the 6d and then put like a microphone jack and jack here and the attachment on top that could be a possibility that probably are hopefully Canon will implement in the future I'm really hoping for that but until then we have to survive with this kind of microphone DSLR or internal microphone that's in the canon g7x or other power shot cameras now of course you need the sound mufflers and all of them I have one on the g7x one here so that prevents the wind getting captured but what I'm very surprised with is how good the quality is on the g7x anyway how I was saying started I moved here it looks like this with the Sun muffler on you probably started previously and on the g7x is just like a small blob on top so that's pretty much it but this audio quality is a hundred times better than the one that's in the g7x for sure no comment on that it is really important to have great audio sound it's not just the picture it's audio that makes everything as well not just video and the quality of the video so if you have a bad microphone the footage can be perfect but no one can hear anything or if you have the footage that's disgusting and a good microphone it again you have to really try to balance it out to have a good microphone good picture not just one or the other so that's my recommendation these are all the microphones that I'm going to mention of course you have many other microphones like the one like that for me I don't microphones you put here I don't know how they so if you enjoyed this video be sure like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in my next video next time alright bye [Music] you
