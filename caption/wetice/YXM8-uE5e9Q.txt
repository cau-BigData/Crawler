hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have an insanely massive report for iOS 13 Bloomberg just released a report detailing iOS 13 and adding 25 features that we didn't even think would be coming I was searching will not be a bug fix update as well as iOS so but rather an update that introduces UI changes a new home screen on the iPad and iPhone sleep tracking and new features in the bedtime now let's get into this report as we have so much to talk about but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more Bloomberg starts by saying that iOS 13 will be a lot faster than iOS 12 even though I find Iowa's 12 very fast bugs in the first version of iOS 13 should be very scarce as well let's look at the UI first there should be a refreshed home screen on the iPad mainly but there will be some changes for iPhone as well there will be new animations when multitasking easier said when swiping up on your iPhone and seeing all your open apps and there will be a new animation when closing the ah this could mean that the whole feel of the home screen iOS 13 will be so much different from what we have been used to however the report doesn't tell us how the home screen might look like you know the widget view right yeah it doesn't look that very pleasant well it should be getting better and frankly a lot nicer dark mode is also coming but you already knew that however you didn't know that we have some new information about this there is some speculation whether dark mode will be completely black or dark gray as on the Mac OS Mojave on the map we also hear that there will be a toggle to turn on and off dark mode in the control center for easier access Apple is also testing a new keyboard where you can swipe to right which has been available only via third tea additions however it is not known if it will be available right off the bat or if it will come later or not even let's take a look at the apps now the health app will be redesigned from top to bottom by having a better daily tap with your calories burn and your exercise rings and so on menstrual cycle tracking will be introduced as well under a specific tab a hearing tab will be added as well maybe for measuring the loudness of your environment and how it might affect your health the reminders app is finally getting redesigned as well it has been this old looking app for so long now and finally Apple will introduce some bright colors into it thus making the app more functional the iPad will have some more functionality like acting as a secondary display for your Mac which is just insane as a parent you probably heard about screens I'm yeah you have it has been introduced in iOS 12 to limit the usage of specific apps at different times and limit the time using those apps well in I was 13 there will be the function to limit people your child talks to it specific times in the books app there will be a reading tracking system with some rewards it might have rewards like in the exercise app for the Apple watch which can be interesting you can maybe compete with friends my message will be getting revamped as well it hasn't been touched for some time now but finally we are getting some news that we should be getting some new features you'll be able to set a public screen name and a profile picture as well as be able to save your recordings of your an emoji and have them as stickers and pretty much send them wherever you want Apple maps have gotten better in the past but now they will be getting even better at least that's what they say you will be able to grow places and create a sort of route with waypoints for your trip for example the frequently searched and traveled places tab will be getting easy kinda even though I've never had problems with how easy it was find my friends and find my iPhone apps well be merging into this one new app you will keep all of the functionality of course but you will be able to buy small little hardware trackers that you can put on your keys and locate them a for example apparently Apple is working on their own version of this hardware however it is unsure when this will be available for purchase the mail app will have some new features as well you will be able to mute specific threads or conversations and even block specific content you will be able to mute specific threads or conversations and even block specific contacts from emailing you sleep tracking is coming even though we already have bedtime that reminds you when to go to sleep do you respect that no Bloomberg says it'll be getting even better in the future this app could be integrated into the Apple watch that could track your sleep this feature will be easily toggled on and off from the control center the whole map this app is horrible and very hard to use and to make things worse it won't be getting any update or redesign however security cameras will have a new tab and you will be able to pretty much go through your footage the share sheet when you want to share something from an app or Safari will be redesigned as well and will become smarter by using artificial intelligence to figure out who to contact and who to share with there is a download manager coming to the iPad on iOS 13 that will be integrated with the redesigned files out however this is interesting and might not be coming just yet on the iPad there will be a new homescreen a new multitasking view and better hearing aid support this amount of features from one report is pretty incredible I'm so excited for I was 13 and to make it even better June 3rd the release date of iOS 13 for developers is just around the freaking corner thank you to
