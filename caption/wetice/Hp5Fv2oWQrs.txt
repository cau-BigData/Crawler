hello how are you long time no see well forget this that it's the stupid son I guess but welcome to another video I did not do this for quite a while so I'm back here I want to show you today what is in my massive oh my god travel camera bag so it's like 15 kilos it's crazy so let's just start opening the back let's open up the bag now so open this part first this plops open and here as you can see there are many compartments so usually there are two microphones right next to each other like this but since I'm using one now there's only one make sense now in this hole here it should be the 60 but it's being used right now so that's not possible next to it is one lens that doesn't fit in like the lens places so this is just the 18 to 135 this is for the ATV as like a vlogging lens next to that lens is the g7 X which I use for whenever I don't need to carry my big camera or whenever I want to record something small so that's here just useful next to that there's the GoPro the GoPro Hero 5 black which is really amazing and I use it so much on the sailing trip so I'm really happy to have this continuing next to it if I take this one out this is the ATD this is the ATD for vlogging so that's just sitting next to it right now and whenever I need to vlog I just don't have it in the bag so it's just there now for storing reasons then in this pocket here I just have another lens this is a very old lens this is a 28 to 105 lens full-frame it's about 10 years old and it's one of my favorite lenses so I'd keep it here for whenever I need it on the other side as well there are lenses there's this one which is a very cheap crappy lens this is the 10 to 18 millimeters but it's a very crappy aperture so it's four point five five point six so not the best right next to that lens there's another lens this is the ultra zoom lens this is a 72 to 10 which is a really great lens if you want to shoot something a little bit further away but it's not really good for videos it's very good for photos and that's this entire pocket so if I close this there's another pocket here so let's start with the pocket on the bottom this pocket has just these two things these two things are just SD card boxes so they're labeled as d cards for photos and SD cards for videos so there you have picture for like SD cards for photos and then you have SD cards for video that's pretty much everything that's tears that goes right over here they're in this small pocket I don't even know what is in there there's nothing it's not really useful space now the main part of the bag and that's this back big huge thing here so if you open this there's like the most crap possible it's like filled to the top so first of all this bag here this bag here is absolutely full of batteries that's the only thing it serves a purpose our batteries for the six dat de g7x GoPro and so on so that's all there is continuing on inside here there is this gorilla pod this is the 5k gorilla pod that I use with the 80 need to vlog so that's always good to have on the road with another one this one is actually for the GoPro that I was using this is just something to attach to GoPro for it not to fall so this is a really good one as well but it's all broken because it's a very cheap and crappy one so really if you're planning on purchasing one for just this one because this one's in metal and this one's in like I don't even know what now that one continuing is this solar-powered battery banks so if you need to charge something or you want to charge the battery bank itself you can charge it with solar lights so when it's sunny outside it charges and then you can charge whatever other device you want so this is a twelve twelve thousand milliamp battery so it can charge some stuff now moving on this is the charger for the dual charger that I bought is for the ATV and 60 so I can charge two batteries at once as for like two cameras at once then I have a bunch of GoPro accessories stored here so a head mount and like a body mount that I use during sailing so it was really useful then another battery bank this battery bank is a standard classic battery bank it's really old and it's it's a 10,000 milliamp battery so you charge it up it charges quite quickly and you have like a battery charge for all day with the GoPro in this thing then I have another thing for the GoPro 40 March then like a car mount for the GoPro or like the window mount and that's pretty much it for the GoPro then not if I don't no that's not it that's this is like a hand mount or if you want to mount something on your hand this is useful and then there's a cable for the charger the charger for the the charger for the GoPro Hero 5 like the triple charger that you can buy where you can charge through batteries at once really useful the g7x charger also very important like the lens Sun protector so you can use this that you have like a circle on the lens when you're taking pictures I don't really use this [Music] another small bag of GoPro accessories and I'm gonna go through all of them but these are just like mounds and small pieces and bits from there and there to mount the GoPro together then I have some filters so these are all filters for the lens depends on the Sun and the conditions so they can make the pictures a lot nicer then just a standard Apple break and I don't even know why it is here a flash a flash for any camera so you can take night pictures of portraits and so on really useful and then my infinite stock of camera back of like microphone batteries so these are all like 9-volt batteries because I'm always concerned and I'm gonna run out of batteries and I actually used like four of these during the trip sailing so you never have enough of them so they're just on the bottom of the bag well and this is pretty much the end so this entire thing that's everything I have in my bag and that's every problem that I have in an airport is that I have to be removing all of this but it's all there useful very necessary and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did be sure to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video bye [Music] you
