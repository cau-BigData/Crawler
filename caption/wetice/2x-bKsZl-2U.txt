hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today we are back with another video it's Wednesday of course and today I am going to look at some of the most creative bathroom signs ever so I have this in my idea no look since a while and why not to do it now if you did not know I desnuda dear friend leave my notebook but this one basically came for a shut up phone and yeah let's look at it so meant to the left because women are always right huh alright well that one has a sense of humor and maybe qui this actually works in all the bathrooms because I in a little of all the toilets meant for that way i believe and women that way so it's kind of funny and it's kind of true at the same time so this is something that we could talk about then and it's true in fact women are not always right but I guess your day centres but Timmy like right really you were right this is actually kind of true we could say this is kind of true because well men blah and women blah blah blah blah blah blah la la la la la la that you can bet you'll a table actually and and i'm going to say all women are like this just bracing everything I'm gonna say Oliver I like this but most of them are kind of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yes these rain bathroom signs are kind of something funny what you could do it's something just fun if you want to ah something cute actually you know man small clouds and the women no swallow so this is something that you could just do to serve some kind of sizes is up that is not like a small figure that a man and a woman it's like a small addition well someone couldn't care less here because they just with half of like the woman's body and for the male's body and then digits whichever so anyone can go there somebody's not careless because you just put that time and whichever yay now this one even I cannot really understand the point because cat and rooster which way should I go in fact because maybe i would send attach the woman I don't know this is after you guys let's see in the comment down below saying you know type which one do you think is for women and which ones for men just tell me that i would i'm really i would i would really want to know what do you think yeah this is also something fun that you can do it really adds something to the door is not only again a dire women that is just like a small figure just put shoes and and it's just kind of it tells you immediately where to go so it doesn't confuse anyone it's just perfect and it's something kind of some creativity to it there is not always so plain this I like this is fun okay and this one for example it's all about the seat so you know it is also kind of sometimes as if you want to do I don't really like you know all these sides are very similar to each other they there you know everyone understands them but the lacs there's a lack of creativity in them and it will be also funny if there will be some creativity in it and then she really does a great job showing the toilet seats basically toilet seat up a toilet seat down is it something cool again for example Google you know retching signs it's kind of fun Android's these kind of figures that's really good i like that again some kind of an instant it's like some kind of google offers or something again a great idea imagination some fantasy there so I like that a lot but anyway guys this will do it for this video of this video maybe a little shorter than usual but there were not many restroom signs that are really like so this is all of them if you enjoyed beastly like down below and subscribe to be greatly appreciated and I'll see you all on Friday take care and I'll see you next time [Music]
