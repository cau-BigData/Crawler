Oh hey guys and welcome to another tutorial I'm so as you know last tutorial i did was about the harvester i believe what we did for the tree farm and for whatever farm you will have so yeah but today i'm going to do a quick tutorial for you guys you know just like to explain um thanks for you but before i start i want to tell you and this is I don't know if this is our design I think it is from our server that we have a minecraft modded SMP decal farm that we have so yeah I would want to fill it with you let me just get a sledgehammer you know these this precision sledgehammer there we go okay so let's start so the first thing is if you want to have it automated as we have you need to build your wheat farm the wheat farm you can go check out my old previous the harvester tutorial but let's just build it so one two three four five six so let's just do this five inside five like so so you need to have a five by five with your breeder oh you need two places place it the other way around like so so it has its breathing thingy over here and this needs power of course for now for the sake of the tutorial I'm going to put it from the back but you should put it from the cider for wherever if you connect an item Doug bringing your wheat but for now I'm just going to put a you know a pipe with with an energy cell just to fill it with energy there's a creative one so as you can see with a precision sledgehammer it you know will breed a five-by-five area so if i'm going to enclose this like so there we go as you can see it's going to breed everything inside this so this is the first compartment where we will have four cows so just holding for that then we want to put a chronic typer over here now it should be moving babies of course and let's check if it's inside there yep so now it's going to be taking all babies from there and moving them into here so what we need to do is also in five by five year 12 yeah but what I would recommend for you guys is to make a wall over here like so because the babies want to see their parents or whatever and what happens eventually is they are lagging out because of their standing on the same spot looking at their parents and your server may have a hard time so you should you know look look into that and see how that goes so then I usually put a cream small conveyor belt here just to have it that they don't stand there and don't clog everything because they can stand there and look still so the conveyor belt moves them kind of here they cannot get there um so now I need to check that because that is 1230 where's my fences 2 3 4 5 6 there we go like so so this is like that and now what you want to do you put another corner typer as you can see that is inside this circle yep and what will happen it's gonna transport adults the adults will move in to hear what we hear we're going to do a small thing here for them i'm gonna get some glass just that you can see it let me put just take some light blue glass i guess um that there so we're going to have a smoke tunnel here like so with the babies being taken and you're going to have a small grinder at the end they're upside down okay so there and the grinder will kill everything in this area so that's good right now what you want to do to secure this little put your put your block on there although the cows don't escape and the same thing here just like protected so as you can see now the cows will go inside there and get killed by the grinder so the grinder needs some electricity so what I'm going to do to make it nice it's just put that and it's going to fill up with power so as you can see it's nice now you can take your item duck you can put the fast one whatever type you have and you can you put it churches that all the stuff get in here your leather and your steak so yeah I mean you're you're all your beef and leather will come here so very simple design here so this doesn't cook it for you but it this is on our server just for collecting leather also food but we have to get by ourselves next thing you want to do you need to power this one over here on that it takes the babies of course and you need to power this one too so let's just put another energy cell there there we go so now all of them have power so now what we're going to do we're going to spawn four cows like for us then it's too many if you put more it's going to spawn more babies and they're going to pile up here so i would not recommend that for is a good amount next thing you want to do is of course breed them or the breather can breed them for you but i'm just going to breed them with my hand now and then you your weight can be inside this breeder of course very simple now normally the babies should get moved as you can see and they go over here and as you can see they are attracted to their to their parents but their parents are not so attracted after so short moment of course as you can see it left it doesn't care anymore but this will still cares little but they are going to move around so that's not a very big problem then once the Scout grows just demonstrate they grow the cows grow and normally in just a sec day get moved over there and killed by the grinder and get moved into this reinforced chest so very very good design if you want to again I can put a few more cows but also minded may some cows die even over here because let's just see it because the grinder comes a little bit inside here but if you want to prevent that just move your grinder by a little bit yes that's like really a small thing so yeah nothing really really big on that so you can fix it very easily by moving this nothing special so these cows will eventually grow get moved as you saw and it's perfect only some XP or get stuck here but that's not a problem because it will despawn so very very good design we use it on our server as I said and it works so as you can see here it will kill them but you know you put your cows and it will work perfectly so you know what is this ok so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this small tutorial hope you learn something um and well I'll see you in the next store you learn the next video so until next time thicker and I the neck at the soul you
