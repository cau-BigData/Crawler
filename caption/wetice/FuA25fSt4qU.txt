hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I would like to take a look at some new iPhone rumors as there should be some changes with the cameras on the 2019 iPhones also we have a source saying that the iPhone 8 might be coming back in 2020 with better internals but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more we got a new report from 9 to 5 mag by maangchi co giving us some information that we have heard and some that we haven't heard yet the front-facing camera should change and how the back camera may change to have a better design maangchi KO says that the iPhone XR 2 should have 2 cameras so that could mean that all iPhones in 2019 will at least have 2 cameras on the other hand iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Mac's will have a triple camera setup now you might have heard of this design which Apple apparently chose for their 2019 iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 max yeah you saw it some people like it and some people just don't like it we get some new information about the front-facing camera on all the iPhones this year there should be an updated true depth camera and maybe a smaller camera as well with the introduction of a smaller camera we could be seeing a smaller notch which would finally go away after 2 years now the front-facing camera should also go from 7 megapixels all the way to 12 megapixels in 2019 which will be very noticeable n your selfies will be a lot better than before with this bumper we could be seeing face ID a lot better and faster let's take a look at the back cameras as you know not many people are fans of this we are hearing that Apple might try to mask the cameras on the back by tinting them but on leaks and Twitter which previously presented us with this prototype goes on by saying that this doesn't make sense as it would not change much now look at this picture and let me know what you think about this tinted camera do you like it or not let me know in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updates with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more I personally think that it wouldn't change much but it would pretty much look the same or even worse however the front-facing camera could be tinted which makes way more sense of course and also this year Apple is adding a wide-angle lens at 12 megapixels to the phone's so basically we will have a standard lens a telephoto zoom lens and a wide-angle lens well these rumors make a lot of sense right well they do and now out of nowhere we get a report from economic Daily News which says that the iPhone 8 will be coming back in 2020 they go on giving us some specifics the phone should have a 4.7 inch screen priced at six hundred forty nine dollars an eight thirteen processor and 128 gigabytes of storage as the first option now we should keep in mind that this source isn't very trustworthy they also claim that this iPhone should be released in the March of 2020 which doesn't really make a lot of sense as usually at this time only iPads and some other things are released also it doesn't really make sense to have an older iPhone without an edge-to-edge display in 2020 I don't think that many people will want this but I might be wrong and this is maybe this might be the demand well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know if you think that the iPhone eight could be having a comeback in 2020 in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
