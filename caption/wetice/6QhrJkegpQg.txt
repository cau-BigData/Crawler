hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple announced a new product for beats for those that don't know Apple bought beats a couple years ago and now they announce the power beats Pro which are an upgrade to the previous power beats 3 these are wireless and have multiple color options including black but if you are excited for this video and videos like these then leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more so what's the points of these well these are specifically designed for people who are very active and need earbuds that are better than earbuds - the reason might be also that airports don't fit some people the power beats Pro have adjustable ear hooks and different cups for your ears so they can pretty much fit anyone's tastes with all this they also feature better sound quality and more but what's so special about these great question firstly if air pods just don't do it for you then these are a great option then they feature better water resistance this is basically the reason why the target audience are people who work out a lot they have excellent sweat and water resistance but not to the point where you can fully submerge them but now the main feature battery life these earbuds feature an incredible nine hour battery life longer than any wireless earbud available right now I would also want to say that this is the main reason why they cost 249 dollars to add to the battery they can charge 1.5 hours of listening time in five minutes yes five minutes now the funny thing these earbuds have a h1 chip which is the same one as in the air pods to that just have released this chip allows for fast connections hands-free Siri which is great now let's compare them a little with the earbuds - you have quick actions which allow you to do many things you can do on air pods - there is a volume rocker improved sound quality and many call buttons to cancel and accept and deny calls this gives you so much control and easy access when working out compared to the airport's - however these are not available for purchase yet these have just been announced and are supposed to be available in May of this year now the only downside I see is the incredibly high price for earbuds at $249 hopefully we'll be seeing these features on air buds - a really soon well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about these earbuds and whether or not you would go and get them when they're released in May leave that in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more but yeah this is it anyway take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
