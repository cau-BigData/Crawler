hello everyone and welcome back to another video love you a security company has sent me the r3 pan tilt Wi-Fi security camera we will take a look at what this camera offers look at the setup process and finally I will give you my thoughts on this device when you get your camera you are presented with all of these items of course you have your camera you have your power adapter your power cord your wall mounting or ceiling mounting or desk mounting accessories and your Quick Start Guide as well as this little pin to open up the SD card slot to put a mini SD card once all your items are accounted for you can go on to the setup part which is extremely easy and straightforward so of course this can be done on your iPhone it can be done on your iPad it can be done on any Android device but let's do it here on the iPhone so you're going to start by heading over into the app store and searching for the app which is called lab view of course on the Google store it's going to be the same now don't get confused with LabVIEW net you have to go a little lower and find the LabVIEW app so go ahead and download that one and wait for it to install once you're done registering this page will open up and this is where you will go and add your device so you will have to select it out of all these options here but you can narrow it down to security and sensors or video surveillance so whichever you choose is correct and you switch smart camera now this is where you will have to go and plug in your device after plugging in your device you will have this little light show up and the sound will be just right after asking to be heard just now so then we click Next and we open up the Wi-Fi settings be careful only 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks are supported so beware of that now let's confirm this once you've added your password and now you will have to go and scan the QR code with the actual camera so let's click continue and you're going to take the camera and go scan the QR code just like this until it makes a and as you can see the sounds were played and now the light is blue meaning that it has connected successfully so you have to just click I heard a prompt now it's going to go ahead and connect to the router the phone and just make everything work out and once it's added you can just click done or before you can change the name but you can of course do that later on as well so then you click done and this is where it's going to load and as you can see the camera works it's pointed at me so it perfectly works and of course you can also adjust the direction so it's not actually really pointing at me or you can just turn it around it works out perfectly and the setup is complete you have three options now you can either have it live and alert you when there is movement or you can insert a mini SD card to record 24 hours continuously or you can use the option with the cloud keep in mind that the cloud is not free but offers the highest possible security I chose the option of recording to an SD card permanently and then you can rewind but it is only up to 128 gigabytes now let's take a look at how it works you are able to record during the day and during the night at 1080p with the help of its infrared night-vision camera you are able to pan and tilt around 360 degrees and the app allows you to customize all the notifications further the app really allows you to customize almost any aspect of how you want your security to work the camera allows for the recording of the sound with the two-way built-in mic and what I love even more is that you can use the option to call someone from your phone to the camera if you live with some people you can give them access with some permissions which is always good if you're out of town let's take a look at a possible scenario you are out of your house and all of a sudden you get a notification about motion in your home well you quickly take it out and look who it is you see movement and you go to the live feed there he is there he is the culprit of course the same thing works during the night unless you set a do not disturb time during the day now look at these two clips the first one is during the day it looks good definitely if someone comes to the house you will be able to identify them now what if it's dark as you can see the dark footage isn't that bad either it's just grayscale and nothing else the day footage definitely allows you to see who the person is and at night you are able to see the person even though it's not in full color at 1080p it offers a good enough resolution with its 2.1 megapixel camera so is the image good enough of course you can't make movies with it but it's great for the price yeah it's really great and good enough first security camera that runs at 1080p well so when its original price of about $40 it would definitely be a product to think about with the amazing day and night capabilities the cloud storage it's very small format that allows you to hide it anywhere it's pan and tilt control and it's notification system as well as Google home and Alexa integration it is absolutely amazing I've had it for a few days and I have to say that for the price you are really really going to be satisfied so do I recommend this product yes yes and absolutely yes who wouldn't make their home more secure for just $14 imagine all the things you can do with this while knowing that your home is safe even further the app makes the whole experience even that much better well what do you think would you get a security camera
