hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we will be looking at Mac OS 10 point 15 which is just around the corner there will be massive changes coming this year which will make the experience way better we got a new report from 9 to 5 Mac saying that they found some of the changes that will be coming this makes it seem like Mac OS 15 will be a big of an update as iOS 13 but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more this leak from 9 to 5 Mac is massive to say the least we already know that iOS 13 will be massive to the home screen the UI and much more but the interesting thing here is that Mac OS 10.15 will bring so much to the overall Mac experience iTunes is the main reason for this as in the past iTunes was very successful during the Arab I pod however not much anymore the app has been revised many times in the past but still not many people like it or use it often unless you're an Apple music subscriber however the leak today confirms that Apple will get and fix that they will bring apps like music podcasts and books to the Mac with this new introduction you will be able to do all your daily activities in separate apps right now you would have to go through multiple menus in iTunes just to access your podcasts and this is a little bit absurd however with this addition you will do everything separately which will make it a great addition the ebooks app will get many changes as well however it is unclear to what extent and whether or not it will be as good as on iOS or not what is clear though is that these apps will be able to run on Mac as on iOS these changes bring more evidence pointing to Apple's introduction of cross-platform apps this was originally announced during WWDC last year in June now you might be asking is this the end of iTunes well no not really iTunes will get redesigned and will probably stay but this brings an end to the iTunes Store the iTunes Store basically makes you buy separate songs which not many people do these days as you can subscribe to a service that provides all the music you'd like for a set amount of money for a month you might remember that Apple talked about getting into all these subscription services in March during their March of an not so long ago anyway this leak confirms that Mac should be getting an overhaul to make it a better experience I really think that it will make Mac a lot better and make the app user experience way way better these changes will make cross-device working on a daily basis way better and give access to all these apps on all devices all this should be announced in June during WWDC let's wait for the surprise well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know if you think that these additions will make Mac better or not in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
