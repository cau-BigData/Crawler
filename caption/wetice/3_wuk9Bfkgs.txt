I can already tell you that this is going to be a video I can tell you that anyway guys welcome back to a brand new video how are you let me know in the comments again now today I want to talk about something different all right it's completely different right because today I really want to talk about something that is why I'm here why I created my channel so this is something that I really want to talk to you about because maybe then just you I had a few kind of questions you know on Twitter so let me just make a video about it now to make it simple enough and breathe because the story is quite long and yeah but if you want you should so watch the video that I posted not so long ago articulate and remember when June or July it's called where Boone guy was a gamer with ice vlog now if you check that video out you're going to get to know my three channel and like that at least you can see the background of this story now basically as you know I'm going to talk about this vlogging channel where as long you know it what this vlog is a channel so I created this channel because of my previous experience with youtubing and I was playing games before new - but it's certain knowing me I do not have as much fun as I had at the beginning now I'm doing vlogs for like a year soon reaction video slash blog I'm doing it for a year now and I'm still enjoying it to the fullest so this is something that I love and have a passion for now gaming I love this before I grew out of it I did not really want to do it anymore and I just really wanted to do something else and then when I was watching other youtubers for like inspiration thanks when I was watching different youtubers for inspiration I really got inspired by a few youtubers how they make their vlogs and something that was completely different from what I was doing and you could have seen the first steps of the way when I went to Croatia and that was the start of when I wanted to do those kind of videos and I had no I was not having my face there or making like vlogs from there but then in September was like a couple months ago half a year ago Pro I don't know it was like half a year later I well I started showed my face in the last year September so it's August right now beginning but you know September's coming swindles at the beginning so in one month from now it's going to be one year and that's where I was sitting in this room and I recorded my first blog which I really want to make like a memory for it's going to be interesting but anyway back to the point I fit in my channel because I wanted to create content since I loved watching you to myself and I wanted to contribute something on YouTube that maybe some people would enjoy and I do this purely because it's fun I like traveling I love making these videos and I see that some of you guys like them now I will make these videos up till I can so I just will continue and I love to do them now another reason why I created my channel was I was not I had no like activity no hobby I was just like a nothing I was nothing I just did nothing I cannot even imagine myself now what they'll be doing without doing YouTube because YouTube ads of like a little bit of stress not really me keeping keeping up with deadlines it's also kind of like hard for me because I love to procrastinate but overall the YouTube also helps me quite a lot because I put out videos every two days sometimes even every day so to keep up a deadline like that it's quite a strict schedule and I have to do stuff in an order to manage to 2003 over 24 hours or every 48 hours so it's just a whole different story in all different levels from what I was used to previously previously I just kept my deadline but not really I procrastinate it's the last moment and when YouTube that's not really possible you have to plan you have to anticipate because Internet can be out no power just something will always happen okay so I always do it struggles with many bloggers I can't really hear but sometimes it's quite difficult because we're alien it gets cold quickly it's and then summer is very short it's like a period of five months or something and otherwise it's kind of cold and so on but anyway during those months I go to France and I try to make some videos there but since I sail it's kind of hard to do but overall I think I'm going away from the subject and going deeper in it but this is all kind of like the background why I already created my channel creating my channel was I mean let me just say really quickly you know make myself a better person meet deadlines what is very interesting interesting people make some content on YouTube that I am watching also some content so maybe some people can watch my content and I can contribute so that was another thing and I just love entertaining people and I interesting people since I was small like since I was like I don't know five years old I was injured people and I did I did not know that LDP at this point and you know it's just different and you never know what's in life so I hope this will continue that YouTube thing will continue for me and I can get somewhere and entertain even more people and more people that would be awesome now I hope these kind of cost like a main story out of this I hope I explained it clearly if I didn't know that maybe you want me to talk about it in more depth let me know I tried my best trying to explain what was behind it like if you don't understand you should go watch the video previously I'll link it in the description about what Lagoon guy what I gave her what I thought it explains the whole backstory and this really is an add-on to it but anyway guys looters for this video if you enjoy this leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future I really enjoyed making this video and it really kind of opens me up more so anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
