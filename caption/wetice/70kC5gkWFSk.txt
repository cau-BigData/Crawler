all right hello guys and welcome back to another video so today we are going to be doing something interesting something fun we're going to be unboxing the competitor of this this is Amazon Alexa as you know this is the echo dot and we're going to unbox the competitor so some of you already know and that's the Google home Mini so this is what we're gonna unbox today so looking at the box see so far from the beginning you have the Google logo kind of nice just what you can ask small and mighty that's kind of interesting I've been looking also at some marketing that Google did and they said that it's supposed to be better than Alexa in some ways so that's why I'm really excited to open this so to unbox it's just really a small strip to open okay and normally it should just open up so I opened it up and wow it's actually on top just sitting it feels really cool it feels really nice I don't know how to describe it it's like a texture it's kind of red or orange from the bottom I think on the camera it's more orange and then you have a port here the USB type I don't know what here and I think the mute button right over here so next in the box we have nothing this is different there's the instruction manual towards the bottom not towards the top where in the leg side was on top so this small pocket let's get started just kind of shows you plug it in download the app we're gonna do that shortly then get to know your Google home Mini you're just a small leaflet you can read I guess just start with okay Google yeah living room kitchen just kind of like a small brochure then what is this oh this is just like whatever papers be safe towards the bottom of the box we have Oh Sam sank so there you have to doing something with Samson Samson plug with whatever type cable box link interesting multiple brands in the box so this seems to be like quite a long cable so you can drag it along really if I should speak about this it feels to be really really good and solid and if I compare these two I really like this one more I really like it more design wise if you compare I mean I guess the buttons on top makes sense but I'm gonna talk about it more in another video but let's just get into let's just plug it in and see what happens so I'm following the first step we're gonna plug it in okay it turned on up here as you can see how it's doing something maybe it's gonna start speaking maybe it's gonna start doing something I really don't know nothing's happening right now maybe it's just booting but while we're doing that I'm gonna take my phone and download the
