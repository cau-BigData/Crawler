hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today if it's a great day I'm so happy to record this video because it's the 20th of May so like great summer is coming pretty soon actually I think in a month right like 21st summer I think so something like that so it's super great it's getting hotter outside great I'm just super excited now today we're going to take a look at some mind blowing mind tricks you can use to fool all your friends so it's going to be something that you can do yourself not just something we react to but that you can use in the future and use it yourself all your friends just make fun now I know this one probably all of you know the first one as people this question in order what's one plus one what's two plus two plus four plus four what's eight plus eight then ask them to name a vegetable they almost always say carrot now I never tested this out so I may test it out eventually you should test it out for sure let me know in the comment section down below if it worked for you and if you got the response carrots I've been looking into this thing bolli thing for like 10 minutes and I'm starting to feel a little dizzy but yeah now I never understood these optical illusions if they're videos or pictures or just I don't know I never knew that actually because I never found out that I'll have to google that but if you know let me know in the comment section down below if it's just if it is just a picture or video or a gif or something I don't know I don't know with this one I agree completely just silence your advantage to a negotiating people have a natural tendency to be uncomfortable with silence and we'll also do whatever it takes to break it just be patient so I completely agree with this because I use sometimes do be patient when negotiating and it will probably go your way because they'll break the silence and try to you know cooperate with you and and find a solution that fits both of you now if you want someone to believe in your lie you should add an embarrassing detail now I knew about this one because you know when you really need to get out of the situation we try to lie not to like make a mess but sometimes you lie in a way where people know that you're lying so you just add some kind of small detail about yourself that's embarrassing for example you wouldn't say no I want that jimson James's house I was a drag me the whole time then you should try saying no I haven't been to jimson's in a while I clogged his toilet so I don't think his parents want me over there for a while now I think that would be a lot better in a way because it'll be more acceptable but it's not the way he could question you that are you sure serious and you clogged they stole it I mean it's a whole different story what its kind of weird actually it's it's you'll see this is probably some kind of stupid example I think it goes in real-life situation you will not say something like that this one's quite interesting do this to someone tell them to look into your eyes and say they can't stop looking ask them what they have to watch three days ago and chances are they won't be able to answer it's very hard to remember something without moving your eyes and actually I agree to this because my friend did this to me and I was like well I was like number one I don't remember what I ate three days ago even without looking away now feels like I don't believe you because like you know that's what you do and that's what the trick is about but I actually don't remember what I ate three days right now I'll have to think for an hour or something or keep a diary what I hate this one's kind of mean but also kind of true at the same time if you want to mess with someone who's counting something say set of numbers in order instead of saying random numbers their brain will catch on to the pattern now lets you like for example once I tried just throwing random numbers but that it not work so well because they just kept counting they just kept counting and then when I started counting at the same time but in like a different pattern it completely messed them up and it is not know who else counting was too scouting and what you want even counting this is school there are fireworks right now that are annoying the crap out of me and 11 p.m. please don't do that please don't do that to me stupid firework this is school like again is it a picture or a video I don't know or I will just my eyes turning in the direction that's just crazy still fascinated by Heidi's obstacles it's just going to say it's repeating the same thing but I don't know if it's a picture or video just please don't press me in the comments or something they still wrap it up for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and until next time take care and I'll see you in the next video does he leave like I think it is by [Music] chill MJ okay
