hello guys welcome back to another video today we have some interesting news because you can go download and install iOS 12 point to beta 1 it's out for the public so all of you know if you want to go get it you can go get it now be happy with it and everyone can go have it so if you want to go get this beta you have to register through the beta program that's for the public and you can just go get it so leave a like if you are excited for this beta as there are many new features even on top of all the features that were featured in the developers beta off 12 point so I've had this beta on my phone for quite a while now a couple days since the developers beta came out about three or four days ago so I have some new features that I found I have how the performance has been for me and how the battery life has been for me so for all that stay tuned in this video let's talk about the new features now so the first feature is Safari now makes it very clear when you're on a not secure website so on the top you will see that you're not on a secure website it's very nice to see as some web sites are not secure can give you viruses and all that so that's something just extra precautions that you can have this will even for some of the websites you're using to get an SSL certification which is basically a security certification that their website is safe another feature that I found that I talked about even in my previous video is if you go to Settings Safari and you go to motion and orientation access which is a new feature that you have in your phone but I don't really know what Safari and different kinds of websites will use this for but we may be seeing something about this in the future and how the websites handle anything with this there are now new experimental features on iOS 12 point to beta 1 which gives you some more experimental things to deal with and as you can see Safari is really being developed and it looks like they're improving Safari a lot as you know that every when you're on your phone on an iPhone for sure or on your Mac or on your iPad or on any of those devices you use Safari on a daily basis and it's nice that they're trying to do something about that so that's way better now a big change now that probably was influenced by chromecast and Google and all of that coming now is that you can ask Siri to play something on your Apple TV so let's say you want to play a movie or you want to play YouTube or Netflix or whatever you can ask Siri and she can stream it directly to your Apple TV which is a brand new feature which is really cool to finally see as I know something we did not have in the past now if we navigate back to settings you go to screen time and down time you have a lot of customization now you can customize everything by day so there are some people that want to have a different down time on the weekend for example and a different one during the different days of the week so now for each day you can customize the down time you want to have which is a great new feature and I'm surprised they did not implement it in the past when I was twelve came these are pretty much the new features that we see but still be for sure new features in new betas and let's talk about the performance so the performance for me has been pretty much the same it's fast there are new animations it's just going quite well I did not find any speed changes everything seems to be super fast as we saw in the previous iOS 12.1 point whatever so just feels great what's great is that it's not faster but not slower as well so we're seeing that it's just the same speed no improvements there but those should probably come once the betas finish and we'll be in 12.3 let's talk about battery life so for me the battery life has been pretty much the same on my iPhone XS I have not noticed anything different about it but some people they have noticed a decrease in their time of battery life so some people say it can be up to an hour some people say it's just about 20 minutes but it's just not a lot even though an hour out of the battery life is quite a lot I have not noticed anything like that so it probably depends on the phone you're using should you update yeah you should update there's many new features I guess the connectivity is good so even if you still have connectivity issues should fix them now and it has it smooth it's just super smooth it fix some bugs and there are not many bugs except the FaceTime bug that should be fixed pretty soon I believe but anyway let me know what you think about this beta and how it works for you down in the comments and by leaving the like but anyway if you enjoyed this leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video okay bye [Music]
