hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so welcome back to a daily video June Street stuff and things that was an awesome intro but today we're going to look at another article and how well do you actually see colors that's the question of the day do you see colors how you think you see colors that we'll see how our going to end up if we can see the colors correctly or something that's smoothing so as you can see our first kind of extra exercise is choose a different shade of orange so if we roughly scroll through these you see that you know through the different shade of orange so in my opinion it's this one where my mouth is right now but quick weight they don't tell you the correct huh no I want to know if it's correct okay next one choose the different shade of purple there is no different shade flash my eyes this one this one this one this one I think choose the different shade of red this one for sure this one alright we can do it I think if we go we can do it we're on great now I think I mean I honestly saying that I'm sometimes color blind because sometimes I said the colors opposite of what the color actually is supposed to be but like me recognizing shades of gray or shades of blue or shades of green it's a total nightmare because I have no idea what I'm talking about I'm not a painter for example they I think they know their shades quite well but let's just see the this present shade of gray because Mike wall is great and I was choosing gray in the shop so this one I hope I'm correct because it's going to end up you know how chooses a friend shade of blue now we know this flashing my eyes flashing this one I know they all look the same to the different shade of green the this one don't say this one I'm probably gonna sail so hard here through the different shade of yellow this one for sure it's darker I think that's gonna be the one choose the different shade of pink all this one I can see I can see that this one choose a different shade of turquoise no no no this one I got six out of nine right and there's some kind of weird kind of put it what is this cooler of colors you have little rainbow vision your eyes can spot purple from pushia and crimson from Irwin your eyes are surprised and you can pick up color like no other weld I don't agree I don't agree Oh creek correct correct yeah that's incorrect dancing correct oh okay this one okay this one correct correct oh oh my eyes are the city disliked also at the follow-up are your eyes deceiving you because they do orange k okay well that's it for the video if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if you enjoy these kind of test stuff thingies then you know just leave a like or comment that you want more of these and and I'll do more of these eventually but anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video which will be tomorrow bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
