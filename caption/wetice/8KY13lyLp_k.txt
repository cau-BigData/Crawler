hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have the first look at the iPhone excite the second gen of the iPhone XR and it looks very different from what we even could imagine and expect Thank You surprise baba and on leaks for sharing these renders for the iPhone XR now without further ado let's get into this video but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more this is our first look at the iPhone the iPhone XR generation 2 on leaks pretty much shares only things that they are so confident in and so far they didn't really make a mistake so this is it this weird-looking thing there are some small things that could change but this is most likely the design we will see in September for the iPhone X R now there are some problems with the design and I know this is gonna start a debate but we have to take a look at it now I believe that this is going to be pretty much to match this XR iPhone 2011 and iPhone 11 Mac's as they have this triple lens camera with this kind of square looking thingy camera that's coming out I'm not a really big fan of this but will have to do with it now the iPhone XR will have the same square the same size pretty much I think but will have only two cameras than the flash on the side which makes it look completely out of place I find this very hard for Apple to do because it just completely doesn't look as the iPhones in the past did so I guess it's a big change and now even if we like turn the phone around and look at the front we can see that there notch is still there big and mighty not I thought that they're not should be getting smaller as well but as you can see it's not we will pretty much have the same notch which is very disappointing and many phone manufacturers remove the notch and apple just elected there so if we go into some history Apple originally introduced the notch on the iPhone 10 way back in 2017 and a year later all the other phone manufacturers started implementing notches but year after year they remove the notches slowly and made them tiny like on the Huawei or it just like non-existent anymore but Apple just decided we have two years why not not change anything and just leave the notch there also to make things worse everything about the phone is pretty much the same as the original iPhone XR maybe some internal specs will be upgraded but there's no USB see however it will ship with an 18 watt USB C 2 lightning port charger but again we're keeping the Lightning 4 to it almost everyone else is moving to USB C now I'd like to know do you like this design because honestly I'm not a very big fan of this weird-looking design and will you be getting the XR the 11 or the 11 max this year and upgrade from your previous phone that kind of luxe adequately and this phone just doesn't I would really love to hear that in the comments down below also does this mean something does this mean that this is like the last year that Apple will make these kind of phones and then just in 2020 make some giant enormous new phone we don't know the self speculation well this is the end of the video let me know which one you'll be getting or if you even want to upgrade this year also if you're down there please leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and sad things like this frankly because this is something we had to talk about ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
