hello guys welcome back to another video today I have got an interesting and fun in boxing finally the iPhone XS smart battery case arrived to my home it was released about a week ago but I've been waiting for it because they were sold out and just finally here super excited to do this unboxing easy Upland boxing let's get into it so here it is here's the box pretty straightforward nice box so I just have this black leather case on my iphone XS and this one should be just a silicon case so let's just take a look at it and let's unbox it here we go let's take this off ok and it just slides out ok mmm it's right here I am excited I hope I got my correct model I think I did remove our phone from the case ok I took a screenshot oh yeah I forgot how beautiful the phone is let's just continue with this so take it out oh right yeah ok do we have anything else in the box I don't think so not even a charging cable ok anyway not even a charging cable in the box we just get this which is the charging case nothing extra now let's take a look at it so as you can see it feels like on top it's quite like nice on the bottom is really solid which is cool and also I wanna know how many milliamps this thing has if we could see that somewhere which I have no idea work and see that either I'm just stupid or I don't know how it works or whatever I cannot find where it says how much it hasn't but but whatever let's just put the phone in I think you just have to kind of slide it in yeah fits perfectly fits perfectly it's quite like it's quite large I guess thicker than like this case but it's obvious because we have the battery so if I plug it in it shows this kind of a really cool animation I plug it in and you can see on top here it's a smart battery case and iPhone so but anyway I mean this is a cool case so I'm gonna let it charge for quite a while now because the battery case comes completely uncharged so there's no battery in it so if you let it charge it's gonna charge your phone and the battery case at the same time which is quite cool anyway it is visible even in the battery section if you put it in your widget so you have for me I have an iPhone the smart battery case and my Apple watch so you see all of your batteries right there and it's charging which is super cool and I really want to know your thoughts on this battery case and how you feel about it and what could be different maybe but anyway if you enjoyed this video please leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciate it and I'll see you in my next video which will be actually in a couple of hours okay bye [Music] [Applause] you
