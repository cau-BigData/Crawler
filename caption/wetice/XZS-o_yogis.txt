hello guys welcome back to another video today amazing day I was twelve point two is officially in beta one however it's only out for developers right now so if you want to see a public beta it's probably going to be in a couple days or a week so for all those people who want to get this I was twelve point two beta one which has a lot of things then just wait a little bit I'm sorry anyway today I am super excited about this release because finally we are seeing some features after quite a long time since we only had a lot of bug fixes now we actually have a few changes and a few features to talk about one thing that I've been talking about in my previous video of kind of like what I would want is the dark mode so when I was going through my phone I did not really find a dark mode in any of the settings so it was just kind of like well that's a bummer but hopefully apples gonna take that into consideration for iOS 13 or even in another release of iOS 12 point to point something now let's talk about all the new features that we have here and some of them are features some of them are really changes that we're not see for a long time for a while now we had the same I can for screen sharing with your Apple TV for example but finally it has been changed to be a little bit more modern and a little bit more refreshed that's just a tiny little difference of an icon change but it still does say that they're doing something with their phones if you have the Apple TV remote on your iPhone then that whole interface is changed up it's just a whole screen now the buttons are a little bit different they're a little bit elsewhere on the bottom it's just a whole nice refresh there since the Apple remote has been with this kind of design for quite some time so just a little change here but it's really good to see Apple pay if you're a fan of Apple pay then you will probably see the new feature and changes so there's a huge redesign in the whole app of Apple pay you can see your previous transactions way easier by year or however you organize it it's just amazing to see that the animations are different and just everything is a lot better there there's a refresh in the Maps application which is just amazing to see because now if you go in settings you have a new climate weather type feature which basically if you're going to the country you're looking in the countries it tells you the weather of that city so if you really zoom in in your map you're gonna see how warm or cold it is in that country you selected there's kind of a new feature in Safari which is motion orientation access which can be accessed in the Settings app and I don't really know what it's used for and I know what developers like asked for that but probably something that I'm not aware of and we're probably gonna see more of that in the future why did I saw finally in the Safari app that has been refreshed a little bit is that if you go into your Safari app you type something in the general search it's gonna give you recommendations so if you type Apple usually you'd have it on the bottom and kind of like different suggestions whereas now you have a blue arrow and it's just way nicer and way cleaner and the suggestions are completely different now which is the whole map has been refreshed as well since speakers have been changed a little bit and TV and all that so now you can access your speakers and your TV and you can set permissions for everything on your Wi-Fi network so if you have a friend over you can set a permission that he can play music or you can just deny permission so he cannot play music a one big thing here for all the Canadian Watchers here Apple news is available in Canada not all the news stations however just a couple but that's gonna be coming out really soon so if you're a fan of the news app like I am just it's accessible in Canada now so have fun with that super cool but anyway these are all the features here I hope you enjoyed this video if you did be sure to leave a like down below and comment down below if you have the iOS or phone to beta one update and let me know how it feels and how you think it is anyway we should be seeing a beta soon for all the public so you can all go download I stole for 1.2 soon and yeah well anyway if you enjoyed leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time okay bye [Music] you
