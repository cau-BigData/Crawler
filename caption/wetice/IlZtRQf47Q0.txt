what's up guys we have been talking about the iPhone 12 pro for a few months now and today we have new reports about some upcoming features we get the news from max Weinbach who already previously shared the design and today we have even more news starting with the display the iPhone 12 pro will have promotion which is something we already had on the iPad for a few years what does it do well it makes the refresh rate of your display two times faster so on the iPhone it will go up from 60 Hertz to 20 Hertz what that means is that previously the screen would refresh 60 times per second but now it will do that 120 times per second this will make the content you are looking at feel much smoother but then there is a problem of power management since the iPhone doesn't have such a big battery as the iPad they will have to manage to keep battery life good of course many of the improvements will be on the software side but the batteries will be getting bigger or at least on the pro max version we are set to be getting a battery that is four thousand four hundred million hours which is about 10% more than what we have now last time we already saw that the knotch will be getting significantly smaller we saw that many components will be moved closer together and the speaker will be in the bezels on top further face ID is said to be getting big improvements as well it is very likely going to be able to unlock your phone from wider angles but we don't know to what extent on the back we will be getting the biggest upgrade ever to the cameras of course we already know that it will be getting lighter which it was first seen on the iPad pro released a few months back app will be using the sensor for better photography and videos of course but there are talks about portrait videos this means that you will be able to have that really cool blurred background in your videos for which in the past you needed a DSLR the lighter will also increase the speed of the autofocus by up to three times which has been the trend over the past few years the detection of subjects in low-light environments is also going to be getting better which is really good news the image stabilization will also be getting better which is especially useful in night mode further slow motion is getting better at night as well on the telephoto lens Apple will be increasing the optical zoom from 2 X - 3 X with no loss in image quality Apple already has a prototype for optical zoom up to 30 X which is something that's will hopefully be coming as well finally portraits will have an improvement with white balance so that your face looks much better further audio zoom is getting better which is when you zoom in on something the audio is louder on that object this is really cool especially if you make videos with your subject being further away so if you are the type of person that loves to take pictures with your iPhone then this year the iPhone will definitely allow you to do that regarding durability Apple is saying that it is going to be doing very well as well we have no idea whether it will be better than on the iPhone 11 but it will be at least very similar further midnight Green will be replaced by a new navy blue color and there will be no smart connector as well as no Apple pencil well the iPhone 12 pro will definitely be a really great iPhone now will you be getting it or at least are you going to consider getting it let me know in the comments down below if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video follow me over on Twitter for more frequent updates and some other fun stuff also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I will see you in my next video [Music] [Music] [Applause] you [Music]
