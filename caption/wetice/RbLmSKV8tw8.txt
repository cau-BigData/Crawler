I find this interesting for a start of a video that's gonna be talking about an interesting topic today we're gonna be talking about the let's say popular Apple product the airport's this tiny little box that's the topic of the video I find them really really good and I'm gonna talk about my experience over the past well what did I get them I think in like October October November December January February March April May June July yeah like ten months about nine to ten months of usage my even in center of the frame yeah nine to ten months of usage so this is my experience that I'm gonna talk about this box when I was looking at it cleaning it a little bit for the video this box is so scratched like I know that the protective cases exist obviously but it's just so scratched whatever who cares obviously anyway at the beginning in October I really thought it was like not worth my money because all the time they were just falling out not listening to anything and they have even marks they have like scratches and scrapes the air pods themselves inside have scratches and scrapes that's how clumsy I am they even found a puddle I'm pretty sure yeah but it's nothing important but just these air pods are really really good and as if my ears adapted to the airports because they just like closed-in or something I don't know and all of a sudden I have no problems with the air pods and over the ten months they work really well the Bluetooth works really well it's really cool to have headphones that you don't have to like search for cable untangle the cable then plug it in your phone search for the dongle and I don't know what else and you never have the dongle I always lost the dongle I had like three dongles and I lost two of them so it's just like whatever just don't use a dongle with headphones that are always just a mess to untangle just take it out of the box take it put it in your ear quick and easy and they're connected I was really surprised when I got them how fast they connect to your phone how fast you can start playing music it's like you're walking down the street just pop them in your ears and just take your phone and put the music on that's how simple it is so the experience was really good I had no problems I don't think at least I'm just gonna hope that no problems will come now because I said that anyway I hope the next generation is coming soon cuz I need to replace them they're kind of I really hope the next generation is coming and be really cool to see maybe some wireless charging and and such with also the air power would be really cool to have so you could charge your phone and air pause wirelessly at the same time would be really cool but no complains charges really quickly last a super long time for me at least they lasted for like more than a day for me when I was using them all the time and if not they last probably a couple days if not a week which is really cool for the battery since I used them a lot and I wanted headphones that are reliable and I don't have the right word and perfect and and and headphones that are really good and reliable that I can trust wherever I go even though I had some scares sometimes that it's so tiny that you just like put it somewhere and you don't even know where you put it and you end up I think then somewhere and I got scared but I define my airports thing works really well even though it doesn't make sound I don't know I forget I just forget but to find my airports thing I think it works at least I think hold up hold up hold up where's finding my phone yeah here I bet it's like okay here earpods place so they can play a song they're not doing anything at the moment [Music] I was making a sound it's actually making a sound okay it works find my earplugs work so that's really cool I have to use that one so it works obviously and it shows it location then which is really cool but anyway just sum it all up I really think that this was a really good so making the sound okay it was a really good investment investment let's say and it was worth the money even though I had some scares and it was kind of stupid at the beginning but it turned out to be really cool for what it is and let the next generation come I'm super excited all right but this will do it for the video if you enjoyed beastly like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if you want me to talk about Apple products um releases the betas and about Apple stuff software dah dah dah let me know in the comment section down below or just leave a like and subscribe would be greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time alright bye [Music]
