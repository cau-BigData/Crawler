to be put in place and then this setup will be done I'm gonna make a setup work on this channel next vlog ok so let's just get working on this set up a little bit ok let's get it so guys I wanted to just talk here a little bit while I'm going to be plugging all of these cables here so basically I'm going to talk to you a little bit about this blogging thing well there's a huge ok I want to talk about this vlogging thing basically because I'm starting to really like it um I hope you are enjoying it a lot and I want to ask you if you don't have like any blogging tips or something you know something that i can use for for this vlogging stuff you know but yeah now i'm just trying to get this working over here um so that's kind of complicated but um then my laptop now the mouse and the keyboard next power plugged now next thing is basically the mouse and the keyboard so it's all of this so I have all of them I Ollie you know USB connectors here i'm using a USB extender here to get it off to my laptop because that is their my laptop's over there and the cables here so they don't preach so that's why I'm putting USB extender so let me just put you back down here guys and let's just plug this USB extender together now I don't even know which one is the mountain which one is the keyboard whatever we are now new age there are no this you know the other connections the green and pink or purple or whatever was that okay but let's now we have the USB extender jobs okay I'm for cable now and now what I just have to do what I have to do now is basically put them over to this nice little USB port for poor thing what's practical you know I like it because I have a lot of USB things and to plug it onto my laptop I don't have enough USB ports that's why I'm using that um yeah but anyway guys now time to plug these so we'll plug it in to cheer my name is it let's plug it into the USB port hub thing and now have all this table here right well uh it's just time is packing up into here on the floor there Oh data hour come on me some cable management in here so now let's put these back there we go and this is nice and done oh yeah i think not very nice but i should work or not yeah okay that down there looks crazy enough yeah oh one day I'm gonna want they organize it not now I just need that set up working then I ordered some stuff from Amazon what needs to come because there's no internet in this room only Wi-Fi and this computer works only on internet my laptop works on Wi-Fi that's good but I have to wait for that and that's gonna come like in two weeks great okay let's get back here and as you can see laptop + semi plug yeah almost blood so now guys we just need the microphone so the microphone is over here so this is the huge to whole contraption thing for the microphone that's the microphone I showed and this is the huge thing so basically it comes to cable like this okay and what I have in this box here somewhere maybe and you know where is it okay so that's this thing well it's basically the USB into a microphone and a speaker so that's very practical so I'm going to plug the microphone into the microphone port there we go and this now is a USB connection / bag now I have another small contraption down here what I need to screw this to my table but first let's plug USB um whatever thing yeah let's let's plug USB microphone microphone setup almost done let's just take let's just unplug this ok and now okay it's stuck in there oops now if I put it over here like so um ah ok if I just plug this like that now that holds except look at this okay without here yeah that is not gonna work that is not gonna work so normally can I can I can I stretch this out can I just take that whoops okay can I take that out and i'll stretch this one out and it's up so now I have this yay so success taking this out now I need to pass this gigantic cable somewhere through inside this small pocket down here this pocket the Cape taken this pocket is great i run all my cables in there very practical this is a desk from ikea so I key a great job with that ok now let's plug this cable okay so some progress here not so very well this cable is going to annoy me a little so what i'm going to do i'm just gonna unplug this and pass it through in here okay and then come and get me some cable Emma's I'm came up ah Oh is stretched okay so now what I'm going to do is basically plug this over into here there we go now this is plugged okay now this is plug there's already a plug so this is plug now now you don't see the cable anymore so much unless you look down like very well the cable is nicely hidden I can be moving the microphone however I want so actually record like this okay like that recording focus okay recording
