hey guys and welcome to another episode of cities skylines i almost said the escape is for some reason but this came as I said many times is amazing I really enjoy playing it and last episode i think we bought this part of land what we did not even use but yeah whatever so today we're just gonna work on fewer things as i said i think i said about the fire stuff or something i don't remember it was like one week ago but let me see is it only me or the money's going down it's going down why let's see electricity we are good except the money is going down what's going on no there's a problem hello oh there's a problem why let me just check that budget hmm if I let it draw on let's see will it stop or what should I do hmm this is entry okay I think I'm okay the mine is going up wasn't it like just a hiccup or something but that was quite scared because it was just going by hundreds non-stop down but yeah whatever so today let's just kind of expand our industry here so remember we put all this with have this landfill site here now let me just check something the traffic is probably terrible yeah it's horrible here it's not it's super duper high okay because here I was expanding the road but why what did i do here let me see specially occupied by what what is police station well let's relocate you there oh my god this just sad faces and smiley faces and just decide what you want people or no water what I'll suit treatment oops okay that's an issue electricity a ok so there's nothing to do with with water that's something to do with electricity now oil power plants were gonna get when we have 4,200 people mm-hmm so what we still have to do is I guess put a thingy coal power plant we have money for that I believe hopefully let's just throw this thing here and let the city run okay let's see of course we are more than enough power and the water situation fixed itself right that's cool okay now we have some industry the man and industry does have a heavy traffic no or since it's an agriculture it doesn't have such an eye so what we're doing it this is what the firehouse or move you there so this is nothing okay so let me just expand this road here can this is the entrance to the residential so it doesn't need to have such a big road going there it's still a heavy traffic area but you know for now it's all I have to do but probably what we why am I losing people but probably later on we're going to put a roundabout maybe small one a large one I guess like here like that's not a bad idea except i would have to bulldoze some stuff and I'm not really ready for that yet ok so we're gonna have to do the literature pickles out just my yeah everything would go bad and yeah so let me just put another road over here like so mm-hmm so this is another what's going on here there's another industrial zone like industrial place where we can put more industry because people want industry people want somewhere to work in here but also convert commercial there's like not so much oh yeah and I was talking about the the the fire in in this district um yeah wait power now this one doesn't have enough fuel and everyone knows why because they're not close to an entry off of the town so basically the resources are not able to come yeah so what I was saying to do later um I guess we have to do it now okay this what I was afraid of but yeah it's gonna be tight maybe get kudos all these people here and put around the boat okay roundabout cool so we have a roundabout now the only thing is there's nothing is connected to it so what we have to do is just put out this thing and get six lane road and we're gonna make an entry to the roundabout like so and then eggs it like so and we're not going to have this connected together okay so now to the residence there are like not many people going of course but what's with this no road access just can you wait for two seconds please okay well now it probably made a lot of mess but this is going to be very efficient for us so what we're going to do from here we're going to run a six lane road is this straight six lane road going like so okay so with two main kind of type of roads and this we may make what can be cool for us if we make something like so okay so like a small connection with the main road so yeah it's all connected up now the residence is connected through here so I don't think we will need to connect through here okay so this is kind of pointless and we'll see what we go this way but nothing for now so if i play the time we're going to lose some people that are here quite a lot of people and lose some money but we're gonna get from it really quickly hopefully and as you can see the traffic flow is probably a thousand times better except look at how many people were losing okay that's not good because the money is going down of course that's like number one now we're having a water problem for some reason oh yeah because they thirsty okay so they are just thirsty they are not connected to the line so yeah so basically nothing is going on so let's just just put another water thingy low happiness well they'll have to be happy for now now what's this what's this police station no road access just put you there okay now everyone's happy and sad and everything together but they yeah crime rate hello what's going on all this please thingy department oh so maybe we need kind of like a small exit here going like this into the street like that small exit and will that do something very low coverage but it does something for now like the crime rate I don't think it's so high that i really need to put a separate police station here but people on the move in the more people want to move in so i'm not gonna protest with that let's just have them move in the earlier we have more people the earlier we have what the hospital maybe yeah for ya all this comes like 4200 and this is one 14,000 oh we're far away from that but we all our citizens are somewhat healthy what i would say also that they are very healthy no 6 citizens well because that's probably that we're not pumping some crap from what we're dumping because last time i was playing basically people were drinking what they just flushed down the toilet so i don't think that was very pleasant for them right let's just pull those burn on buildings but really going to do something here because the fire hazard is fifty-six percent in our whole town what is not so good right now what I could do and I forgot to do continue right it's continue this road so here what did I just do I just made like a completely bad road okay and basically hello connect and connect okay so everything can go back this way so all the trucks and everything can go this way that's good okay now big traffic areas here oh because this is not even upgraded into big roads what did I do Oh mess I just made a mess um because all this did not have the roads correctly done but hopefully now yeah well now we have a electricity problem because they're like not connected to the grid or something and they don't like that um well just quickly move in because then these guys will have problems and issues and everything ok let just you wanted that so you have your power now now let them move in because I don't just chop the whole thing down yeah suit yourself but let's just put some more in here with this paintbrush thing okay let's just put some more here okay that's that's enough and now oil is covered we're product we're producing 100 megawatts of electricity what's quite good right now let me see just come on farmers or whatever moving yeah okay you're moving in and also moving over here so this is connected to the to the town so basically they should not have such a big problem hopefully let me see let's just start upgrading everything all together that we don't have problems then okay okay like so what did I just do this like leave no upgrade upgrade now this I should do early on because then you know if imagine there's so many people are you working here and then I just to mess okay so let's just have this done here okay this is good now watcher they thirsty okay well you're thirsty so yeah let's just do that they should have water now now we're still good on watch it well he has a problem what's going on here not enough customers and who told you to even build your shops here just saw this that it's like the worst shopping district here and maybe we should work on some kind of shopping district here but it should be close to the entrance because of the city now we can uh we can put a more residence here maybe next around about okay like that and I guess more people can can just start start moving in here yeah and they can live near the roundabout whatever it's like prime apartments near roundabout okay that's good now these are just complaining not enough customers but now finally they got customers and their operating normally and let me see the traffic I think yeah we solved it we solved it is all pretty much greenish type thing they're using this road a lot too probably from industry all the people that work here that they can directly go yeah I think that's what they're using the road for okay but traffic problem solved now probably gonna have more problems I see them coming already so let me see and as you can see I have quite a lot of money now and I if I remember correctly the incinerator costs thirty thousand each so that's why I'm kind of trying to keep some money that I have it ready when I need to incinerate because that's gonna be quite soon now these just woke keep complaining they don't have enough customers when just well then I don't know what you should do people don't want to buy anything from you well yeah that's your problem now this not even know yeah okay and maybe if I put some some shops here okay this is like prime location for shops now let's see and I think like skyscrapers what's this no this is some kind of things unique buildings friendly neighborhood park if I put this thing here oh my god it has a huge range yeah I just put it there now all these people will have pretty much hi wow I just put them like this unique part type of thing was this friendly this is a very normal neighborhood park where everyone's friendly and where children like to play and families go out picnics requirements for building the atom project was the atom project we have also a mall of moderation this mall is not so posh but has a lot of small cheap shops we'll see we'll see what we're gonna do but these guys are upgrading all the land values probably going up is there like this thingy for land value what's this land value yeah land value is white hi around here okay no allies here so it's like somewhat in the middle but that's good that's really good at it stores the middle now he's just complain con you're not enough customers well watch I like Lee what should I do with them ok industry maybe some more but i think i did not reconstruct it properly because this roads are not done at all so I should probably read with like that and let's see if I need to put some and to fix them that they can move in okay here we go let me see they break more things no now there's this trash thing here so I cannot really do nothing with that but also I could put a small road here maybe that would work and I can put maybe some more industry in here like so that's a that's nice ok so now just turn the time on and let's see what's going to happen so basically I put some more industry now all the industry pretty much most of it left so yeah it has to move all back in but now the roads are somewhat done of course here they are not done what's this pellet fuels ok well build Oh what's this there what's that I was looking at that on the beginning but I never understood what's that so we have this big highway here where I see probably one car every few yeah ok but our small town is coming together ok now let's just see this industry needs to start moving in because my money yeah okay well okay did you start it abandoning here because they don't have enough customers well so i'm just gonna bulldoze them but they're the only complainers here okay only complainers they only complain they come and they complain now maybe what we can also do maybe if you paint the district but can I see policies what's this or okay well let me see is this better modern increase ground pollution and electricity increases tax income hmm ok well yeah we're gonna look in that but these are policies yeah these are policies now what do we have we have upkeep 54 building no ok not yet I don't have so much money and I'm just gonna be wasting it and just putting it on people's houses no but anyway guys if you
