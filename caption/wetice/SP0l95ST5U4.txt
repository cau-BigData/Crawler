Oh hey guys and welcome um I'm gonna say shortly but we are on our survival road as you can see over here and well this is another tutorial but we are on our survival road because we have our laser drill system here on what maybe some of you know from our from our episodes that we have so what I want to do is a small tutorial on it very shortly like quickly here just to show you how this whole thing works because maybe some of you want to know how this works and what the hell it is so we have a laser Joe generating our oars of course that are from our power system connected here but this is not a tutorial on then from the laser drill the all the ores are extracted through this pipe over here into this chest okay before it come before I start these some of you may say why did I not connect them to this router well because we want now I'm gonna say we have a power system that is from big reactors mode and it requires yell all right so this chest has all the air right come and we want it as fast as we can to our you know yellow right our big furnace so we have it right here and we have its own system so its own pulverizer and its own furnace so that's what we have then from this all the oars except yellow right get X tracted and go into this filter then this filter as you can see all these ores go into our storage all the rest go through the pipe through here into the pulverizer to get pulverized for maximum efficiency and get taken into this um as you can see router here what that's another thing here so all the or all the pulverized you know like ingots and valuables that don't need to be smelted get extra tit and go into on this chest and get taken up okay what I mean that's perfect right then over here these are items that need to be yeah so all these go into our sorry for that all these go into our storage and accept of these all of them except of these get moved into this chest over here and go into this redstone furnace what cooks it and then it goes into our system but coal or that gets into here is on white list here on this filter and gets put into this redstone furnace and that's because if it would pavarotti the coal that would not be good it'll smelt it and it'll be bad and would make these bars of whatever so we don't want that so that's why we have the coast melted and put into our system of course but the next thing is what we have over up here is what you can put if you want if because that generates a lot of wars so we have our Auto crafting benches here so this is perfect why we are using these is because they are the best for at least us and they don't make so much like since we have so many of them so for every you know in god we have to craft it in a block we have it over here and it all goes so it's perfect then these from here get you know output it and it goes into our storage upstairs so that's like the basic whole system of this and it's very very efficient and we have these chests debt just to have it like you know not being messed up going up and down just not making a mess around here um so yeah anyway guys um I hope you enjoyed this episode not episode sorry this tutorial so if you enjoyed this tutorial like and subscribe it really helps me out so yeah until next episode of tutorial yeah I'll see you in the next episode
