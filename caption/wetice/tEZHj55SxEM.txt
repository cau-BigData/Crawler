hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we are unboxing the Huawei P 30 pro now I didn't really look at the specs of this thing so I'm gonna get into it and give my real thoughts without looking at it so we're gonna start off the unboxing by peeling off the plastic which has already been kind of broken off but let's just go in remove this plastic by the way to prevent comments like whether you get this phone from I got this phone from China this phone originates from China so this is the Chinese version for anyone who wants to know this is going to be my first reaction okay here it is Wow now as you can see it has Chinese characters here so this is a Chinese phone now let's see okay remove it from the box here it is okay it seems light let's just remove this okay let's get okay oh wow oh my god it has a shiny surface and everything where I'm gonna put all of my fingers on here it is here it is so it has a screen that is completely edge to edge even on the border that's how edge to edge screen this is Wow so it's the phone is really long by itself it feels like a lot longer than the iPhone access for sure but I think it's the same width so it's like a long phone if you know what I mean okay so just by the way this is the laser color at least that's what they call it so it's a really shiny surface that changes colors as you move it around so it's blue purple kind of goldish kind of pinky purple yellow that's what it's doing wow this is amazing so this phone comes with a quad camera by Leica so one two three four four cameras right on the front here so we previously unbox the huawei mates when DxO click here if you want to see that unboxing that was with the triple camera I did a lot of videos on that anyway let's turn it on and we're gonna finish off the unboxing so okay did I cover oh wow the screen is just so fascinating don't you think the screen wow I am impressed let's just zoom in a little bit so that you can see a little better so it makes the same noise which is expected sorry for the lines that's just gross so as you can see it starts up with the Chinese menu you can of course change the language to English and then it's in English so if we get started United States yes oh wow oh wow look at what it's doing you literally go on the edge okay Wow Wow like the camera doesn't even do justice of this screen I've completed the tutorial I want gestures finish here it is Wow Wow so this is in gestures mode so you're using gestures for all of your things so swiping like on the iPhone XS for example okay I am impressed this phone has a screen that's so impressive okay Wow now the cameras we're gonna go take a look at those in a upcoming video so stay tuned for that it even has different app icons and everything wow I am impressed anyway let's put this down right over here I'm gonna unzoom so we can get back to the unboxing so here we go this we don't care about that we open this up we get our pin right over here to open up the SIM card slot and we get as always a protective case that is transparent so this is something I love about Huawei you get transparent cases included with your phone so you don't have to go and buy a case so let's just throw this thing in it and here you go so you keep your beautifully laser look and now we've got our standard headphones which are USB see by the way cool and then we've got our cable our USBC cable right over here to charge your phone and then we've got this big power break which I cannot use here in Europe because this is a Chinese plug wow this is a supercharged 40 watt okay Wow this must charge so quickly incredible and then the box is pretty much empty what you get with the box is your charger your USBC cable so it's USB C 2 USB and your headphones and your beautiful gorgeous phone with a cover that you can put on and then of course you've got this little box here with a pin kind of like some paperwork how it works it's all in Chinese I cannot read that is incredible this phone is incredible so we're gonna be doing some testing in the upcoming videos as I said I'm really excited for that but this phone is a beauty anyway if you enjoyed this video and missed out on my previous video then please click here but also before you do please subscribe and leave a like it's all greatly appreciated ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
