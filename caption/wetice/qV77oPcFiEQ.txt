hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we've have some things to look at first of all the March event is just in a couple of hours so I want to talk about what we'll be seeing here as there are two reports from two trusted sources talking about this later I want to talk about the iPhone excite rumors is there's a little bit more to talk about on that subject but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's start with the March event that is in just a couple of hours with these two reports from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg Bloomberg is saying that we may see a game subscription service from Apple meaning that you will be able to play all the paid games for a set amount of money per month Bloomberg says about $9.99 per month so you can play all the games without having to purchase every single one of them however this is unsure next The Wall Street Journal says it we will be seeing a new subscription service which will basically have a bunch of channels of news they will be in one app you pay a set fee every month as a subscription probably $9.99 for some channels but you'll probably have to pay more for all the premium channels like the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and so on just probably ten plus dollars a month also Bloomberg says that a TV subscription service is coming which will be kind of like Netflix but I don't know how it's gonna work as it sits a lot of money to invest in all these movies and I don't know how they're gonna compete with Netflix but that's something that Apple will probably handle and that is set to be at $9.99 per month as well for just like basic shows but if you want to watch the other networks the premium networks like HBO then you'll have to pay a premium on top of your basic subscription service so the The Wall Street Journal says that it will be probably $9.99 pair channels so if you want to have three premium channels you'll have to pay $9.99 99 and 999 that adds up very quickly if you want to have a bunch of channels so I don't know how that's gonna work but it's really expensive with this event approaching as well we will be seeing iOS 12.2 the official release for everyone not just the betas or the developers so with iOS 12.2 will probably come the subscription services so that you can subscribe to them so that should be coming probably next week or just after the event or in a couple of hours as a matter of fact now let's talk about some of the iPhone x ir rumors which are quite interesting to see so we previously looked at the design which would be on the iPhone on leaks kind of confirm that and it should be the first prototype with a weird-looking camera I know I personally don't really like it so we will see about that we get a new report from Mac takara talking about bilateral charging now many people thought that it's basically that you place something on a charging pad and from there the iPhone and on you just pile up but in fact Mac takara says something completely different they say that you just have your iPhone remove the charging pad and you'll be able to put your ear pods on top or your Apple watch and they will charge which will be super cool two CS it's very annoying many times when your Apple watch runs out of battery or your air pods so you could be able to charge them just by placing them on your phone also Mac the car goes further by saying that the iPhone will keep the Lightning port now I know there have been many rumors about the iPhone having USBC or the Lightning port but Mac takara says we will be seeing the Lightning port but don't get your hopes down we could be seeing the 18 watt charger which will be USB see 2 Lightning port which will allow for very fast charging which is great to see hopefully with this Apple will ship this in the box which Mac takara anticipates and the iPhone will be able to fast charge so these iPhones will be coming in September but for now let's just focus on the March siobhan which is just in a couple of hours so yeah well this is the end of the video I'd love to know what you think about the new iPhone and about the March event whether or not you're gonna subscribe or something like that yeah let me know that also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more anyway take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
