hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some interesting things to look at we are going to take a look at an iPhone that I'm holding in my hands it's an iPhone that's 4 years old that I've never ever had in my life it's finally here we're in 2019 so this unboxing is theoretically four years overdue but let's not talk about that this is the iPhone 6s that I recently got I'm collecting iPhones so that's something I really really love doing is collecting iPhones and having an iPhone 6 in my collection is something I always wanted so here it is here is this iPhone and never thought is this gorgeous actually even though all iPhone unboxings are gorgeous and it was even in 2015 or whenever this was just take a look at this thing I really am excited to embark sit for my collection even though as far as sounds stupid and some people cannot even afford this that makes me sad today that's not about being sad it's about unboxing this amazing phone and here we go the plastic feels different did I change the plastic over the years the stupid question anyway here we go so this should be a normal iPhone unboxing of the iPhone 6 and I want to open it out that's something I wanted to do for a long time open it here we go O'Reilly here it is regular unboxing of an iPhone so it doesn't seem like that changed much but here it is it was this small in the past they never thought it was actually but it's cool to see this phone here super thin as well which is great to see and wow I just love inboxing Apple products probably knew that already so we have our holder we have some paperwork here that we're not really gonna get into we've got these headphones that these change over the years I cannot even tell anymore but here are they but they're the standard headphone jack anything yeah this phone has a headphone jack yup this phone has a headphone jack so you get headphone jack air phones earphones whatever they're called you get your standard lightning port cable and a power break so this is pretty much what you expect from a iPhone 6's unboxing so for those people that are getting iPhone 6s in these days I really recommend it actually it was a great phone I don't know about the support for iOS 13 but I think it's gonna be there even though this phone is quite old now I think we're gonna still see iOS 13 on it hopefully that's what I'm pretty much hoping for now gonna peel off the plastic or should I yeah let's peel off the plastic I love peeling the plastic off it's just an amazing experience Wow here it is the iPhone 6s in 2019 still here still good I actually really like this one and there's gonna be another unboxing soon of the iPhone 7 I don't know what I'm doing but the iPhone 7 is my favorite one by the way it's gonna be great even though I'm not gonna really use it but I will turn it on and see how it works but if you enjoyed this unboxing as much as I did then please leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with Apple news and stuff like this even though there's no update here but it's still super cool to see anyway take care and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music] you
