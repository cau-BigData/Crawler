hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released I was thirteen point four beta one one week after the GM release of iOS thirteen point three point one we are going to take a look at some new features and changes as there are some as well as the performance battery life and whether or not you should update alright let's start with the update size it is quite a big update at over four gigabytes coming from Iowa's thirteen point three point one the update size will vary of course depending on which device you're coming from and which software version as well so let's go into settings and general and about and click here and we can see that the build number is 17 five two two three H so if we go a little bit lower we can see that the modem firmware has been updated from one zero 4.0 6 and 13 point 3.1 to 1.0 5.23 and that's a really big update so of course if you had any connectivity issues they should be fixed or at least result in one way or another let's look at the changes and features so the first big change is here in the files up if we're going to the files up and we select a folder that we want to share then we are able to do so now we are able to share with whoever we want and messages airdrop whatever and we can airdrop the entire folder whereas in the past if we go into the photos I just took a picture of it right here as you can see here this icon would be grey it would not be blue meaning it would not be available whereas now it is available to share the entire folder so of course you can select some people you can add people they'll be able to use this this folder and add things into it as well as see in real time what you are adding so that's a really good feature right over here on top of all of that we have new MIMO G stickers as you can see the one with the the laptop here kind of all of these we have many more MIMO G's compared to the same thing right over here once you see there would not be the the MacBook sitting and just like a bunch of other meme now for some people and I was thirteen point three point one when they would try to summon Siri they would not be able to process a request through Apple music so it'll just keep saying like I'm on it or something like that but now it should be working now on the topic of the Mac a little bit you are now able to download apps that you have downloaded here so all the apps that you download on the App Store on your phone or your iPad you will now be able to download them on the Mac without further purchase of course this is only available on the beta's currently but it should be coming really soon to the Mac now what about the mail app so the mail app is quite buggy since the beginning of iOS 13 and everyone knows that and now the mail seems to be quite good for four for the moment but if we just select an email for example this one okay uber eats no one cares as you can see we have more options on the bottom than before before we would have just two options here now we have four of them to use so that's a little change which is quite nice to see but another problem that many people experienced is from basically they would have to go into the mail app to refresh their emails instead of it refreshing by itself in the background which would be quite annoying for people who rely on emails a lot now if you want to fix that try updating to thirteen point four to fix that bug but I didn't experience that so I didn't have any issues and I cannot comment on that one feature that is not thirteen point four related is the Google Translate app which now works in dark mode so if you go change this system-wide you want to have lights mode it's gonna change the light mode however if you want dark mode it will automatically enable if you have the sunset to sunrise or you can just enable it by yourself for the full day now what about performance and battery life performance seems to be quite good for the moment I don't seem too happy having any issues whatsoever however it's too early to tell because I've had it just for a couple of hours but it seems to be about the same there's no notice difference in animations or anything like that it all seems to be about the same now what about battery life well battery life is quite excellent on this phone throughout most of the time and battery health on this phone is 100% still so it's quite good so I have good battery life throughout the day as you can see I sometimes go through a hundred percent sometimes not but the phone will ask me about two days on average which is really good battery life let me just go out of dark mode because I don't need it right now so it's quite good the battery life you're definitely not going to notice any significant difference if you're coming from thirteen point three point one but definitely if you're coming from an older version you might have a little difference especially on an older device and that same thing goes to performance there should be a little difference but nothing a major but of course thirteen point three point one improve the performance and our battery life a little bit so there should not be any noticeable difference on here now should you update well there are new features of course as the iCloud feature and many other changes and bug fixes however it's still beta one for this version so it might be wise to just stay a little longer on thirteen point three point one if you are there and just rely on the good performance and battery life that you currently have however if you have issues with the mail app and want to use the iCloud sharing then definitely upgrade to thirteen point four as there's nothing bad so far but for those that want to install a thirteen point four on their daily driver I would definitely not recommend you to do so because there might be some bugs that we haven't discovered yet and there might be some other issues that could interfere with your daily usage of your phone so definitely if you're on thirteen point three point one hold off a little longer unless you really want to go or if you have another device for example that you don't use then you can go ahead and stall it so you can go ahead and install thirteen point four on that older device and test it out and play around with it however until then on your daily driver you should always remain with a stable build that has been tested and is like a GM release that's what I would recommend or at least if you want to go to the daily driver then definitely try to wait a little longer maybe until like beta 2 or 3 alright well this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed this video if you did then please do leave a like down below as it helps me out tremendously and also don't forget to subscribe
