hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some exciting news about the 2019 March event by Apple let's talk about it but if you're excited then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay informed about everything that's coming anyway there's gonna be a number of products released during this event probably including a new streaming service and new service new iPads iPad Mini 5 air pods - and maybe finally the air power that'd just be great but we have so much to talk about so let's get into it let's start with the new subscription service so as you know Apple already has Apple music as a music subscription and now you're thinking of a movie and TV subscription streaming service which would be great to see because the iTunes Store right now that you can buy movies on it's just kind of like you have to pay for every single movie and they could make something where you pay something like Netflix for example so the TV app will most likely have all of it as you know that you have a small TV app there if you're in the United States and you can just probably later use it as a streaming service that'll be really cool to see but let me know what you think about this down in the comments section I really want to hear your thoughts about this new streaming service let's talk about all the hardware that will be coming now so let's start with the air pods - which is one of the most highly anticipated products right now that I've been seeing everyone is talking about the new air pots air pods have blown up in 2018 and everyone's getting them they're super super trendy right now and everyone wants to have Bluetooth headphones that are so tiny compact it's just going on so there are many rumors that these air pods will be coming in March as even iOS 12.2 has kind of some details about this however let's try to talk about the features and who will be most likely seeing boo for sure see a hands-free Syria which is something that been put into iOS 12.2 by many analysts that we're looking at it which is just quite impressive to know also we're supposed to be seeing a wireless charging case or if not the air pods will be able to wirelessly charge however I think they're gonna come up with the air pods to which we'll be able to charge wirelessly and a case which you can put on your air pods one so that you can be using wireless charging as well so these are supposed to come right now very soon and hopefully we will be seeing air power as well during this event as it would be really nice to see that air power comes with the wireless charging of the air pods so anyway to recap for sure we'll be seeing a hands-free Siri and wireless charging case and maybe maybe some health features or even a massive or design let's talk about another highly anticipated product that Apple has been talking about for a couple years now air power is probably going to come during the March event which is going to be super amazing and as you know production has started a couple weeks ago so they're probably going to come along with the air pods which is just so exciting just let me know how excited you are by leaving a like let's get into the iPads we'll probably not be seeing an iPad pro in the near future as Apple released an iPad pro in 2018 at the end of 2018 so we'll probably be seeing an iPad pro next year or at the end of this year however iPad Mini 5 and the regular iPad both are coming which is just exciting to see iPad Mini 5 will be able to use the Apple pencil and the Apple smart Keyboard which is something new we never saw the regular iPad we'll have some changes as well including a bigger display going from 9 points an inch display to a 10 inch display will have thinner bezels on the sides so it's pretty much going to give you a bigger size of screen touch ID is most likely staying as I don't see that Apple was put into a cheaper device face ID as even that piece of hardware isn't really cheap yet the processor will probably be the a 11 bionic as the previous one was 8 10 and I don't see Apple putting the newest a 12 Bionic as its eye they never really did that yet so probably an A 11 if you're excited about the a 12 I don't think it'll be coming but we may be surprised there are many rumors now about the iPod Touch 7 which may be coming as well now it'll probably have the a10 fuse and chip if it comes and we may see it in March or even later maybe after the Apple iPhone event however that's all unknown because I didn't hear a lot about iPod 7 there are some rumors going on as well about a whole pod many so a mini version of the whole pod which could be coming however there aren't any details about any of this and I there's no big release date but it may be a surprise during the March event where they'll mention that a whole pod mini is coming but anyway their main focus will be air pods iPads new subscription service and hopefully air power so you should be expecting all these things during the March event which is super soon less than a month ish kind of a month yeah but anyway lets me know in the comments which product you're excited about in which one you would get and why i would be really interested to see your input on all of this but anyway if you like this video then consider leaving a like and subscribe to stay informed about all the new apple news anyway take care and I'll see you next time with more rumors bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you
