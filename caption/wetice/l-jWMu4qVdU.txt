what's up guys I have been using iOS 13 point four point one all week primarily on my iphone XS and the iPhone 11 pro max I didn't expect a lot from this update especially that it's just a point update but I was really nicely surprised let's take a look at the amazing update including the changes performance battery life and the bugs let's start with the biggest bug fix that we have been waiting for for so long the text message bug it has been annoying me for so many weeks now but it is finally fixed if you remember before this update I would not get any notification or banner I would have to go physically into the message app to see now it works all the time another big bug was with the VPNs this bug would allow for the VPN to have not fully encrypt your data and let some of it through leading to vulnerabilities unfortunately this bug is still not fixed in I was thirteen point four point one which is really weird from Apple so we will most likely be seeing thirteen point four point two very soon another really annoying bug was the Instagram audio bug which is finally fixed as well before you would still hear the audio from Instagram after leaving the app and going into another one or just staying on the home screen which would be really annoying for many people now it is fixed and it never did that again to me so if you've been still having these bugs in thirteen point four point one let me know in the comments down below if not then let me know as well so regarding the connectivity many people reported issues with connectivity especially with Bluetooth these issues seem to be fixed for me however many people are still reporting issues with the air pause or randomly disconnecting however I have never seen this issue and I cannot say I didn't have it so if you're still having this issue then let me know in the comments down below if not then it might be fixed now what about performance and battery life so performance is really good I have not had any problems with performance in thirteen point four just some minor hiccups here and they're but a really nothing major there is no lag or stutter it feels smooth however with all these bug fixes and little improvements around the system you will definitely notice that there will be a little bit of a speed increase and just the way you use your phone will be much smoother and seamless because all of this annoying things were fixed what about battery life so battery life is quite good here on the iPhone 11 pro max that is also partially because the maximum capacity of battery is still at a hundred percent even without that the battery life is amazing here so there are some days which I use the phone a lot but most of the time I don't use it too too much but as you can see I can go probably two days or so with a hundred percent with my usage but of course that will depend on your usage and how much you use it so for me it can last the whole day or two days with no problem but of course it depends on what you're doing and how long you're doing it so what do I think of this update with all these bug fixes the software version is one of the best by far out of the thirteen point four series if you didn't update yet then you should definitely do that for better performance better battery life and less bugs further on battery life many people on older devices noticed that the battery life is longer than usual so maybe thirteen point four really boosted battery life on all the older devices so now when should we expect iOS 13 point four point two and I was thirteen point four point five beta two so we might be seeing I was thirteen point four point five beta two coming tomorrow or on Tuesday or we could be seeing I was thirteen point four point two around that same time further keep in mind that the iPhone 2020 should also be coming next week probably on the 14th or fifteen there will be an announcement for it and then it will come out the week after that so there's a lot of exciting things going to happen next week and I'm really excited about that are you excited about that let me know in the down below well if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up there okay take care and I'll see you in my next video you
