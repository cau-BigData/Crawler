hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some interesting stuff to talk about so as you remember from my previous video I talked about iOS to open to beta 2 for the developers with a bunch of new features now today all of you can go get it it's out in the public beta as I said previously it's not a gigantic update it's just loaded with some features that can be cool to look at and it will overall improve your experience on your iPhone lets me know if you're excited by leaving a like down below and subscribing for all the latest news about all of this and a bunch more videos let's talk about the new features so as you can see if we scroll down we see this new small animation here so if we click on that it opens up and we have a new kind of thingy here so if we click that and we would play something it would flash blue which would be really cool and interesting to see in the Apple music app the animations are way quicker there's a new animation there that kind of pops and pops out which is super cool to see as a small change there and now the most interesting part out of all here if we go into text messages then we would have here let's say you're texting someone you'd click on the animo G's and we have some new and emojis to talk about so we have this ref here which is just me talking and then we've got shark which is super cool with even the tail that's so much fun we've got an owl hi owl it's super cool to see all of this and then we've got I don't need that I think was from the previous one but we've got these four new and emojis so that's just a lot of fun and you can have a lot of fun sending this to all of your friends and just like I really giraffe though or even the shark like the shark is pretty cool with a tail waving and all it's just a lot of fun so you can even record yourself wait sharks have a tongue I don't probably not supposed to ask that probably stupid but you can send that send that to someone your friends just gonna be like this super cool to see this kind of animation here now I talked about this in my previous video so this is just my homescreen if we go on the back as you can see you previously see your date here but now it just shows 91% charged nothing else I don't know if that's a bug or a new feature where you would see on the lockscreen how much your phone is charged but I really miss seeing the date right here if we go into settings into general and about we would find that our modem firmware has been updated to 1.0 for point 13 which means that if you had connectivity issues in the past they should be resolved with this probably fixing your Wi-Fi and cellular issues and stuff like that and also I think the FaceTime bug should be fixed but that's just for more and further testing so if we look at the performance we go back to the phone as you can see it's sim superfast nothing really slow here the battery life is terrible for me so the previous beta was as bad as this one I really go I charge my phone I just charges it it was like 12 p.m. now it's 3:00 and without a usage I'm down to 90 and even during this recording I just lost 5% which is not super cool and could be better but anyway that is everything so if you found something else in this beta and something that you like and don't like about it let me know in the comment section down below and like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated about all of the latest news anyway take care and I'll see you next time [Music] you [Music]
