hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I've had iOS 13 point 1 beta 3 for about a week I will talk about my experience and compare it to the iOS 13 GM release well let's go discuss the new changes that I found some battery life issues and some positivity the performance and some bug fixes that I've noticed about bugs and some bugs that people reported so the new changes so third-party apps are actually starting to intergrate dark mode into their apps meaning that if you are going to go here and basically select dark mode on or off the app will actually toggle the dark mode as well so that's something they're working on now which is really really cool now this is not only an I was thirteen point one this is probably coming system-wide as the app developers are working on it now the optimized battery charging which can be found in battery life and battery health optimize battery charging which is basically to reduce battery aging is now more apparent than ever I've been getting more notifications that you have to unplug when reaching 80% or it's sufficiently charged or Siri suggests it or singing just basically more throughout the system apple arcade just released to the public so you can go to Apple arcade and you can go play some games you can try it for free for a month and then just pay $4.99 per month for a bunch of amazing games that I've seen during the WWDC presentation the multi camera recording is not here yet but should be coming soon but you should not expect that to be coming into the camera app but into third-party apps that are developed for using that one app that was presented was during the event that we had just a couple days ago now LTE and Wi-Fi issues some people had those but the modem for murrow's updated in this version and it seems like many of those issues are fixed even though I didn't notice any single change in speeds or anything like that everything seems to be the same but for people that had Wi-Fi and LTE issues it may be a good idea to update because everything seems to be just stable now some of the bugs there are some bugs with the podcast applique which I don't really use but I've heard that podcasts have bugs when you want to pause either when you want to pause from here or if you want to pause in the application directly carplay is still buggy apps will still crash the car might not detect the phone and there might be some unexpected restarts Apple music has some bugs as well while adding songs to playlist and the App Store sometimes crashes when opening it up and opens up to just a white screen so that's something you have to keep in mind as that might be an issue audio sharing is also not working with my earbuds which I don't understand so if they use two pairs of air paws if you want an audio share it just doesn't work and the menu just doesn't show up for me now my experience so the performance as you can see is very very smooth everything works really well the animations are super smooth and fast there's no lag no stutters and it just feels like a stable build now iOS 13 is pretty much the same in performance compared to this one but if you're an iOS 13.1 you should just stay there as it feels more stable than I was 13 but Iowa's thirteen is still very stable battery life is extremely good so I can go throughout the whole day without charging my phone I don't use it as often now but as you can see throughout the last 10 days even six hours or more can go with the phone and it just works really well and I feel like I have a lot of battery at the end of the day so from the morning when I'm at a hundred percent to the evening like eight seven eight pm I have a battery full like it's not full but like they're still battery left and it's pretty much kind of the same so I was 13 because iOS 13s battery life was amazing as well well this is the end of the video so I hope you enjoyed this little update on iOS 13 point 1 beta 3 let me know if you did by leaving a like and by subscribing to my channel that would be greatly appreciate it and if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown in the corner up there ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
