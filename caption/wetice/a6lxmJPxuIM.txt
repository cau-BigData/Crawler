hello everyone and welcome back to another video today continuation video for the homemade 20x and today I'd like to talk about night photography on this phone so this is kind of a series that I've been making about all the different parts of this phone and reviewing all of them now previously in my photography review I talked about night photography but in not so much detail so today I'm going to talk about this phone and night photography in a lot of detail versus the iPhone 6s which I make the previous video about as well so the main picture that we're going to take a look at is the night picture that I took and it was part of also the photographic video but this is the picture you're gonna see it on screen and now this picture is basically the iPhone XS and Huawei mate 20x of the same image the same scene you can call it and so there are some differences that you must take into consideration and actually notice on these pictures so what I feel right here if you look at the iPhone and of course remember these are without flash so as you can see I prefer the iPhone X s image and I'm looking at both of them here and I also looked at them on my computer but the iPhone X's image is way clearer versus who always won which is just a lot grainier so of course you have probably way more pixels and way more like an image quality to process further on however the image is way more grainy versus the iPhones image so normally this one has a really good camera with a very low light level so a very low aperture this one as well but I'd really don't know what happened on the Huawei one as the picture just seems worse during the night than during the day now on many devices in the past that was true because you needed a very good camera with a very low aperture so that you could do this kind of thick but what did I find surprising is that this phone has a 40 megapixel main camera which this picture was taken on with a very good aperture and it still made a grainy image versus Apple's camera which basically has a low aperture as well and it did a better job than the Huawei ones so I just don't know and it's maybe even the saturation which is kind of off as well if I'm looking at it really well now the saturation in the image especially if you look at the fences and the lights in the city you can see that it's really really saturated which is not really a good idea and also the sky is really saturated so that might be the reason why the image is kind of grainy so well this is my in-depth talk about night photography on this specific image so of course these can apply in many different kinds of environments sometimes the iPhone X's - might be worse so it's all dependent on the light in just the whole environment so in my environment I would say the iPhone Nexus did a better job of night photography versus the huawei mate 20x which didn't really do a great job and I was expecting it to be a lot better than the iPhone XS but unfortunately that was not the case well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe it is all greatly appreciated and also let me know in the comments down below what kind of videos would you like to see on the whole way mid 20s and also give me some recommendations and some videos you'd like to see about the p30 because the videos on that are coming really soon okay take care and I'll see you in my next one bye [Music] you
