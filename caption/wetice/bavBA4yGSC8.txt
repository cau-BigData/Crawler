hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we are going to take a look at the basics of photography you might be a beginner that just wants to know about photography or someone that already has some experience but wants to build on it if that's the case then this video is perfect for you before we start I would kindly like to ask for you to leave a like and subscribe for more videos like these there are five main topics exposure aperture shutter speed ISO and white balance these are just a few out of the many other concepts that there are in photography starting with exposure there is one main concept that you must understand aperture shutter speed and ISO are all elements that make an exposure there is this one help that I found it's called the exposure triangle to completely understand this triangle we have to take term by term starting with aperture as you can see you have F 2.8 all the way to f/2 any to keep in mind that cameras can have an aperture lower than F 2.8 you must know that the lower the aperture the more light enters the lens so naturally the higher the aperture the less light enters into the lens what does all this mean in simple words darker environments need lower apertures and lighter environments require higher apertures the next term we have to understand from the exposure triangle is shutter speed you might be asking what is the shutter speed and what does it do well simply said it controls how much light gets into the camera for still shots you will use a very fast shutter speed at for example 1 over 250 if you would use a slower shutter speed it would make a motion blur as seen in this image for example so the shutter speed varies on each given situation however there is another good use of a very slow shutter speed and that is night photography by having a slower shutter speed you allow more light to come in meaning you have a more exposed image this can be seen in this nighttime image there is also a very good reason for a fast shutter speed and that is for action photography for example simply said it is for any irregular environment with a good light level now finally the last term in our exposure triangle which is the is o when you increase the ISO the image becomes more exposed and when you decrease the ISO the image becomes more underexposed however this is the simple way to put it but it gets a little more complicated the higher the ISO the lower the image quality and the more noise there is noise what is that well that is when the image becomes grainy this means that you have to set your ISO to the level where the image doesn't become too underexposed or overexposed and where it doesn't compromise on the image quality if you understand these three main terms that are from exposure then you are set to make great images as exposure is one of the most important parts of course choosing the scene using the rule of thirds the Nifty Fifty and more is important as well but image quality and the exposure comes first at this point I would like to ask all of you if you would like to see a video on how to set the scene what the rule of thirds is what the Nifty Fifty is as well as many other concepts let me know in the comments down below and by leaving a like and by subscribing now for the white balance which is another very important concept to know when taking pictures what is white balance you might be asking the white balance makes the photos look the way they look in terms of colors it is responsible for the warmth of the image and detron mind if the picture will be blue or orange and cold or warm previously you might have used auto white balance however that doesn't really do a good job you should select different white balance options for different settings you are in well this is it for this basics of photography video if you found this interesting or learn something new then please leave a like and subscribe as this greatly appreciate it if you have any other questions or any video suggestions please post them down in the comments section okay take care and I will see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
