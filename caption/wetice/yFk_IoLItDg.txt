hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are three months away until iOS 14 is released and we are finally getting some leaks from the software we are going to take a look at the newest iOS 14 and iPhone 9 rumors as well as some updates on Apple's March event recently I noticed this video going around which is a screen recording by someone who is running an iOS 14 internal build on their iPhone 11 pro max we can see that the multitasking view is completely redesigned and it has some resemblance to the ones seen on the iPad is it fake originally many people thought that it was a jailbreak tweak but a trusted source been Gaskin said over on Twitter that this is part of the internal build of iOS 14 we still have to be careful as it could have been manipulated but either way would you like to see something like this let me know in the comments down below from that same leaked video many people were not happy because the homescreen looked exactly the same as in I was 13 many people were looking forward to this because of a few weeks a long time ago but we never had any solid evidence that Apple would redesign the operating system in 2020 with the massive number of bugs on iowa's 13 apple√≠s thinking to make stability the priority on iOS 14 Apple wants to prevent a ton of bugs from making the experience really bad and Bloomberg shared this little graph of apples unlucky I was 13 we can really see that iOS 13 had the most bugs that needed to be fixed compared to its predecessors so for those people that wanted a home screen redesigned they will probably have to wait maybe one or two more major updates before seeing this we have another report about something interesting from Bloomberg by Mark Kerman he is saying that Apple has recently started looking into allowing users to use third-party apps as their default app so if you have a Mac you know that you can select a third-party app as your default app for example switching Safari for Chrome if Apple allowed this you could set your own default apps that are necessarily made by Apple further in the report Apple might allow Spotify to play directly on your home pod instead of just Apple music this will definitely make sense and would drive up sales especially for the people that don't necessarily have an iPhone or Apple music personally I always use Spotify but I had to get Apple music as well to play music on my home pod so this change would allow me to have one subscription with all my music of course keep in mind that Apple is only considering this and it might not happen what about the supported devices I made a video a couple weeks back about this so if you're interested then please click the card shown up here since then we didn't get any news about this but I think it is safe to assume that many devices will still be supported however I feel like the iPhone se will not be supported anymore especially if it is replaced by the new iPhone 9 also known as the iPhone se 2 we have been talking about the March event for some time now and it's becoming very apparent that one might be coming a source is saying that the event will be held on 31st of March 2020 and sales for the new iPhone se 2 would start on the 3rd of April we pretty much know that the iPhone SE 2 is coming this year but Apple's factories are running at a reduced rate due to the ongoing situation in China so this could bring some delays to the March event as well as product releases for this half of the year further regarding some other Apple products like the Apple branded headphones a new Apple TV and some new watch bands in my last video we got some leaked images from Target employees that found unreleased products in their system after further research I am pretty confident to say that the air pods Gen X priced at $399 won't be a regular air pods but the over ear headphones by Apple however mark Berman said on Twitter I don't believe Apple informs target of upcoming launches at all or in this sort of detail take this as an employee inserted these cues on their own speculation therefore I would not trust this too much but you can still expect these products this year I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] [Music] you
