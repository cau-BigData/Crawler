all right hello guys and welcome back to another video today I'm going to talk about my favorite Amazon Alexa echo dot features so this is what I'm going to talk about I have five features that I actually love and I'm gonna talk to you about them so here we go with number one so my top favorite feature is Spotify Premium on your Amazon Alexa which is like amazing now it only works in the u.s. so if you're not in the US like me if I'm if you're in Europe then you will have to actually have an account with the location or like country set to us and then you can use it so you cannot bypass this except it's a little bit annoying that it's not available in Europe the second feature is the enabled skills is that you can enable skills just by talking to Alexa which is really really good that they really love you just you know say I likes a turn-on I don't know what and it's going to actually work so that is really good sometimes even she offers to turn on some kind of some kind of skill that she wants to add since you're asking something that she doesn't know yet so it's really cool what's integrated that basically if she doesn't have a skill that you're asking about she's going to ask you to download it and go to your application and kind of navigate you through the whole process which is a really good feature because sometimes Julie get confusing how many skills you need to do what so you need skills for every single thing you want to do with Alexa if you want to control your smart home you need to get the Philips hue or whichever smart hoe technology you have at home so this is all you can download from the Alexa app which is for free on the App Store or now that leads me to the third favorite feature and it's the smart home control the control over your home is impressive you know I have lives I have sockets that really work well with Alexa so it's really you know you're hanging out just say that you want you're seen of course you have to pre set up the scenes and in the Philips you app or whichever kind of Smart Home applications and accessories you're using so you set up your scene and you just import them into the Alexa app which is very simple so that way you have actually no problems at all and you control your air conditioning your sockets your your your lights your LED strips whatever you really want you connect to it as long as she has a skill that leads me to the fourth one which is basically the routines which is really really good you can set up routines like Alexa start my morning or likes a good night and you can set up what you want to happen when you say that for example that she tells you the news the weather the traffic and all kinds of other things that you would want to know in the morning so I have the Alexa start my morning or start my day you know and then she just tells me the weather she tells me the news that you preset up by getting skills for example the New York Times or Fox News or whatever you really want and the weather you just set up your location in the Alexa so pretty much sort of everything in the Alexa app now the fifth and last one and that is the knowledge and information you can get by just asking her about a given topic you want to know who is I don't know who is the singer that you heard on the radio she will tell you when you're playing Spotify you can ask who's the singer who's doing what in the music so it's like she has so much knowledge that she gives you by just asking her that is really really cool so these are the five top features that I really like and love with this Alexa I mean I had to like suggest for under a month I think and and I really love it I use it every day you just have to get used to it and it's gonna work so I hope you enjoy this video I hope you then check out my upcoming video which will be the worst and missing features on like on Amazon elec cycle dot or in LX I in general so I'm really excited to do that a video as well and I hope you will tune in to that as well so if you enjoy fish leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video all right bye [Music]
