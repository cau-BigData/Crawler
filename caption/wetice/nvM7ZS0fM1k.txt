hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at I was thirteen point four beta 4 that came out about a week after beta 3 to the registered developers and the public beta we also got this update for iPad or West TV OS and Mac OS but there's no watch OS update we are going to take a look at the changes the performance battery life and some of the bug fixes so the object came out about 151 megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max the size is very similar on the iPad pro as well of course this will vary depending on what device you have and from which update you are coming from now if we head over into settings and general and about section and click here we can see that we're running 17 e 5 2 4 9 a the a at the end means we are getting very close to the final release so the final release could come right after this or we could be seen another beta but more about that towards the end of the video now if we head over a little lower we can see that the modem firmware didn't get any updates so if you have any connectivity issues they will most likely not be fixed in this update if you've been having any so there's one change in Apple music where basically there's a new screen that opens up when you're downloading music this is available on all iOS versions now and it's not tied to 13.4 beta 4 because it was done on the server side of Apple music what's up is also now supporting dark mode so for those that love dark mode like I do what's that will do that but of course this was an update by whatsapp and nothing side to 13.4 so when the system will be in light mode whatsapp will be light and when the system will be in dark mode what's up will be dark right makes sense besides this there are not any other significant changes further the mail app is starting to get a lot better than before if you remember the bug where the badge on the mail app would show number but then when you went in there will be no emails this bug seems to be fixed and I hadn't had this bug here but I was experiencing this one in the past that is very smooth and the majority of the bugs are of course Fix so I'm very happy with this one and I didn't find any more issues in the mail out the notification overlapping bug seems to be gone as well I didn't have this issue again in beta 4 I got some notifications didn't happen I was still having it a little bit in beta 3 but it was definitely better so for those like me who had this issue it should be fixed in this beta I've heard that some people had some problems with face ID not recognizing them or saying some weird messages I personally didn't experience this bug but let me know if you were having this and if it is fixed in beta 4 let me know in the comments down below the messages bug is still present so the message is bug basically when you get a message normally it should alert you and they should make a sound or vibration or a banner but it makes nothing of that so you have no idea if you got a message or not so that means you have to go check physically into the app and therefore your responses to messages are quite delayed I also heard that some people were having issues with connectivity but I personally didn't experience those for me connectivity is very good including Wi-Fi cellular and all of these there is absolutely no problem over there so I can't complain but if you've been having any let me know if they're still in beta for now of course the Instagram bug I was hoping for it to disappear it is still here so this bug basically what it does is when you're playing a video in Instagram you go out of the app you go to a different one the video would keep playing and basically the audio would keep playing as well so you'd have to completely quit the app and everything and it's very annoying and this one has been here for quite some time and I can confirm that it's still here let's hope that Apple fixes this one we're really soon now what about the performance and battery life so the performance is very good on this phone particularly and on many other phones that I tested it out on I tested it out on the iPhone X s and on some older iPhones as well it seems to be doing quite well however if you remember this bug that I was talking about in my previous video where when you went to the About section it would like starter there for a while and it would take like two or three seconds to open up well now as you can see this bug is fixed so that's good to have fixed therefore the performance had a little bump up other than that it seems to be quite good now you will definitely not see any improvement from beta 3 to beta 4 besides some minor tweaks that you will most likely not see with just regular usage what about battery life so battery life has been quite good for me as well on this phone I had no problems of course I don't use the phone a lot recently but it definitely takes me through like two days or something which is great however I got a comment on my previous video on beta 3 about a battery draining issue on the iPad pro 11 inch so if you have this issue try updating and let me know if beta 4 fixes that if not then hopefully the final release well of course there should not be any significant difference between beta 3 and beta 4 regarding battery life because for me it was quite good and I didn't have any issues whatsoever but let me know how the battery life is going for you in the next beta so when should we see the final release well I would say that it could be next week or the week after depending if we get a beta or not so normally I think we should have the final release quite soon but if there are still many issues and bugs that have to be addressed then it might be delayed by a week or two well
