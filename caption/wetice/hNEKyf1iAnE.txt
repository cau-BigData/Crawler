what's up guys recently Apple released I was thirteen point five point five to the registered developers and the public beta after thirteen point five point one but on first glance we found absolutely nothing oh if you missed that video then please click the card shown up here this might very well be the last update for iOS 13 so today we're going to pull down the curtain and take a look at everything that is hidden from side courtesy of nine-to-five Mac we are also going to take a look at IO s 14 especially the widgets which might be coming but not in the form we expected so let's start with iOS 14 because it's practically just around the corner all the rumors about the widgets on the iPhone homescreen made it seem like they would really come but a tweet from Jon Prosser makes much more sense he believes that the home screen widgets are more for iOS 15 rather than the upcoming iOS 14 however he does say that widgets will come in one shape or form this year what many sources seem to agree on is that widgets will be coming to the control center there are also some thoughts about third-party apps being able to use the control center which would be really really cool but then you have this image from at Chaco bit which looks like the home screen but then could also be the control center well what do you think let me know in the comments down below all right on to iOS 13 point 5 point 5 so at first we didn't notice anything right well 9 to 5 month date they discovered that Apple is working on Apple News plus audio so essentially an audio version of the news app this will be for Apple new subscribers only so if you are one then you will definitely be able to use this in iOS 14 but what is even more interesting is that Apple will be using in-house actors to voice all the news articles which is really really cool however when looking at the cost of all the subscriptions combined so Apple TV plus then Apple arcade than Apple News Apple music it can reach a couple hundred dollars per year real quick which at the end doesn't make it affordable for all on the good side of things though Apple is set to be working on a service bundle for all these services which might resolve this issue if it is less than a couple hundred dollars per year but will that convince you to subscribe to more services if it's all bundled up let me know in the comments down below in regards to the iPad because I know many people are looking for some additional features to make iPad OS that much better again 95-minute find that I was thirteen point five point five reveals that Apple is working on new shortcuts to change the keyboard brightness of course you can already do this from settings but it'll be nice to have it more accessible like a shortcut on your key the idea here is that you could modify some of the keys in settings to make it control brightness for example of course this is a minor glance into what Apple is planning for iPad OS this year which by the way is set to be huge well we are about two weeks away from WWDC which will present iOS 14 and all updates to all operating systems including Mac OS iPad OS watch OS and TV OS but unfortunately for now we will have to wait just a little longer to see all these amazing changes if you enjoyed the video then please do leave a like subscribe and hit the belt to stay notified when I release my next video if you missed my previous video then you know what to do please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you my next video [Music] you
