all right welcome back to another video wow I'm really kind of kind of I'm very happy but not happy at the same time let me explain why so it's almost true that means it's almost summer it's really cool I'm really excited for summer but some big changes coming for summer for sure so the first change is my video schedule I'm gonna talk about that so starting I think is the 2nd of June there will be videos twice a week so on Wednesday and Sunday so I pretty much changed the schedule completely so that's a big difference because you're gonna see two videos instead of three videos a week and on Wednesday Sunday so in the middle of the week and during the weekend it's really cool because I have to get ready for all the videos that will be in July and August because I'm going to be traveling a lot and I have to pre-record so it's just going to be a lot easier for me to to have even a little bit like cooler and that leads me to July with many videos summer related type related and just like stuff like that and also two videos a week so Wednesday Sunday that style has sided on both months and pretty much August as well so for the next three months I'm going to be on two videos a week which is lot less let's say stressful to be editing and recording and all kinds of things so let's take it I'll take it as like a little vacation even though I'm going to go somewhere what I'm going to announce later I'm not gonna spoil it now I'm gonna probably announce at the end of June and so yeah that's a cliffhanger and that's gonna be really cool but September we are restarting three videos a week but I'm gonna talk about that more at the end of August and September is gonna be a gigantic month off nothing squiggly this is just I don't want to spoil anything so it's like a big surprise and I don't even know really if it's gonna be like this big like just this big so that's pretty much it this is just like a small channel update talking about things like this I I you know changed the channel art I hope you saw that too spring really like it how it turned out I just really like how everything is going right now the channels been growing as well everything has been going fine so this is pretty much the channel update just something small and I also see that you enjoy geoguessr again so I'm doing it every week once a week so pretty cool I think geoguessr I love the game and it's going to be all mostly here in September is gonna be really cool it's passed so fast but anyway if you enjoyed this channel update leave a like down below and subscribe and even leave a like if you're like super excited for what's to come if you're super excited for what's coming I'm really excited but I'm going to be making these kind of channel updates a little bit more often because I want to see and kind of like reflect them in the path in the future when I want to watch back just to kind of see how my channels been evolving so alright take care leave a like subscribe and I'll see you next time alright bye [Music]
