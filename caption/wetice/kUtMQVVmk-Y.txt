hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we've got the huawei mate 20x right here to be unboxed I'm super excited to open this one out this is a triple lens camera phone with touch ID face ID I have all here like great grip a 7.2 inch OLED screen and a lot more so I would like to dive into this and here we go my first phone Android phone exciting unboxing so we've got the lovely box right over here I would like to get into it immediately with this knife I don't want to like damage packaging I think I already did anyway let's just open this up easy plastic off and boxing anyway I was saying this is the first Android phone that I've ever gotten so exciting moment right I know it is here we go I think it slides out as an iPhone box I'm gonna be doing a lot of comparing to the iPhones in this video which is expected here it is hey hello wait do you see this it's kind of like dirty already don't really like that but let's just continue here here it is 7.2 inch phone where's my iPhone for comparison my iPhone is a 5.8 inch I think like let's just do it like this uh-huh a really cool comparison but this is amazing I've seen this phone and ever since I saw it I was just like hey I have to get it and so therefore I got it this is the Chinese version of the phone so all the way from China it is here it's supposed to have some better functionality and so on which is cool to see and it the wrong socket so yeah same anyway we've got this leap this little leaflet here that it's not a leaflet well there's stuff here there's paperwork but you get a case included with your phone so just a transparent case just like this easy comes with the phone which you can then put on it let's not do that now but when you put all this to the side we get our simple little opening thing for your SIM card slot which is great that it's included you get your power cable which is a USB C cable which will be great for fast charging and so on and finally you get your included headphones which aren't always the best but that isn't test these out so this phone is pretty much unboxed now if I move all of this to the side I would like to look at the phone a little bit closer as you can see here the phone has three cameras the phone has three cameras here that this is pretty much the touch ID sensor which is great at it's on the back even though like I like the unlocking on the front on the iPhones but I guess it isn't that bad since you always put your finger up here anyway so just click that it should touch idea or you can use the superfast face ID which I believe is faster than on the iPhone at least from my testing here it is peeled off it's in a whatever color what's the color name blue or midnight blue or something like that super nice color it also comes with a protective screen cover right over here so that's already included with the phone so you don't have to go and buy a separate one as you would have to on the iPhone or on and the other phone so really cool to see that and I just like it yeah it's midnight blue actually they have also phantom silver which looks purple but Kay um it's supposed to be really cool and that's what I'm saying pretty much five thousand milliamp battery which is bigger than the one in the iPhone I'm pretty sure and yeah honestly great to see and I mean you know a big phone I've had big phones in the past but not at 7.2 inches which is just amazing to see but if you'd like to see more about this phone this is just an unboxing I'd have to share some details about this but if you want me to show you more of the phone review it maybe do some pictures on it some stuff it comes with a 40 megapixel camera so we could do some cool stuff with that some comparisons I would love to do that let me know in the comments down below but thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more and stuff like this we're really cool anyway take care I'll see you in the next video bye [Music] [Applause]
