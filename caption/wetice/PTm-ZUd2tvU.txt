hello guys welcome back to a new video today I am super excited because I finally got the Amazon echo dot three so I had the previous version which was the echo dot two and I did not really like it but this one seems to be a little bit better than the previous one at least that's what they say and it's the third generation so it should be a little bit improved so let's just get into the unboxing alright so I'm just gonna use this clever knife here probably not necessary alright here we go so we're just going to cut this and open the box here we go so it's right on top I go to different colors so like don't be surprised by the color alright oh my god it's heavy that's like geez okay here it is [Music] wow look at this thing like it seems to be completely redesigned from top to bottom like look at this select the buttons let's do it like a side-by-side comparison so here this one is the series 2 and this one is the series 3 it's a massive jump actually like so far ok they switch there's different chargers I mean there's different inputs of power so like here this one is a standard adapter but this one is up USB whatever version but it's like super heavier this one I guess and it's impressive well let's just put it on side let's continue the unboxing we've got some okay instruction manuals I'll keep that because they're usually a pain in the butt to set up but there we go what is this things to try ok this opens up and ok a completely different power break ok there's nothing else in the box nope ok ok this is a completely different power brick than I saw then we saw before which is kind of impressive but it's kind of annoying that it's so big like look is this thing like this is massive and it's 15 watt charger ok well so we unboxed this this is the new Amazon echo dot 3 and this charger plus some paperwork I'm really excited to test this out because it seems like it's gonna be way more improved and like a lot better performing the speaker's probably seem to be bigger and we'll see what it can do but I'm going to talk about that in the next video about whether to buy this one or this one or which one's better so ok this will do it for this quick unboxing here I'm super excited does this out because it's new and the buttons are completely different as well which is kind of impressive and nice to see and let's see if you can have it plugged to your speaker system permanently and then it can switch between the outputs that'd be great to see but I'll have to test that out but for now if you enjoyed leave a like subscribe it'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you next time with another video ok bye
