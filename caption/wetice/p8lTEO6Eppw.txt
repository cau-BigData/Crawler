hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today you know I got this kind of idea that you know there are some construction workers who work smart and I actually architects you could be more precise as our smart summer drunk I believe and today we're going to look at some of the funniest construction sales okay well maybe was the architect or the construction workers but this makes absolutely no sense and I don't know if this is like a balcony or something or like wasn't meant to be a staircase that you don't know but obviously when a train is going to pass it's gonna have a hard time I believe it is ah even it's going to crash probably actually well someone was smart hey why don't we just build of cash machine where no one can reach it so this guy is actually trying pretty hard to get some money out of the cash machine and you have to stand on one foot kind of lift himself up okay finally an ATM for giant mmhmm yeah that's not gonna work probably for many people well the complete opposite is the cash machine that so low that you have to sit down to take your money out great this is accident edition really smart so first one for Giants and the other ones for small people yeah this is some intelligence here so yeah just put water into a top see how smart very smart into the blog just put watcher nothing plug yes kids go ahead go play on the playground you're gonna have a lot of fun yeah it just slide down the slide and you're gonna fall as whoa you're so smart construction workers and architects how about this oh sorry we just need to put a pole mm-hmm I'm just going to remove a small piece of the rail to just put the concrete and the chain will just stop yeah it's not gonna go sorry not our fault I guess this is so stupid huh well someone really miscalculated this the bridge is obviously not going to connect this way there they're just kind of dumb and stupid because and Alan Anderson how can this happen like you're going according to a plan how can you get this result what is this this sound this seems to be the most intelligent that someone's thin because it's the faucet longer than then the sink so what can I say it's just going to go it's just going to go all over the place it does anyone know how to go on hmm because obviously these guys just put stairs to one part in any public you know catch the rail go go through the rail you know that's the rail kind of make your way through the rail things and then you should go deep the other stairway that sounds to be your it extremely extremely smart and I'm going to work yeah well this is rude actually so for wheelchair people they put chairs in front of it just to piss them off or something I guess and then just keep it up access just go away you can know we would charitably more people to fit yeah okay guys but this will do it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated and subscribe for more videos like this it will be greatly appreciated thanks a lot for watching and I'll see you in the next video take care bye tell me John you
