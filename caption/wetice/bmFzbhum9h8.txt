hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today is another recording day of course and today what we're going to do is fill another review I reviewed many things on my channel and many of the things i reviewed i used on daily basis so if you really want to do some stuff like me of course you don't need all the equipment that i have you can start off with just started a camera that is but what you need is a microphone that provides you very good audio so today we're going to review this microphone this is the road microphone and basicly i will have all the details link down below I don't really know the number or the name of it specifically but I'm going to be sure to link it down in the description so it won't give in the description you can go click on it you can go by the mammals on and so on and you can check if it's the microphone want to buy but i really recommend this microphone for some me what they do right now a record on my microphone that is a plot to my computer I don't use I don't use this microphone here but whenever I go outside this microphone is very useful it's very useful even inside i'm not going to say that it's not I really recommended because the audio on the canon camera one is yours i'm using is really really crap i'm going to switch now to the 100 be listen Oh welcome it's not really good hello welcome okay you hear me and now we go back to my right from the right question my computer is the next show microphone of toner so that's completely different but if you want me to review that i will review that later on maybe in the next video so this microphone really does a great job but oh there is a man because will they recommend if there's a lot of wind is that you buy one of these things you should buy one of these little fluffy thing is that you just put on top of the microphone i'm going to show you so what you do you just take it and you just kind of unzip it over here and what you do you think the microphone and you just kind of wanted honest and baby clean up this is very useful because when there's wind let's just try to put it on okay there we go spare with me okay there we go so this book is going to look like once once you have the filter on it and basically it protects the microphone from wind that means you're not going to have all these kind of wind noises in your microphone and the video group to be overall better quality if you have this little fluffy thing you should take it off it's perfect for inside because you obviously don't have wind inside and yeah yeah it's it's inside it's perfect this other thing is also from road so you can write if you want with the microphone now you heard the microphone that I have on my computer and you heard the camera microphone and what about the microphone road so we're going to i'm going to go plug it in and we're going to see the difference so i'm going to play the audio of the 100 e and the audio of the microsoft okay so this is how the microphone sounds when it's blood to the camera this is how it sounds when the microphone in North blood the camera so horrible right okay so there are many uses for this microphone as I sit on this camera you can put it even through all the different cameras but the only thing that I can find kind of like a minus is it you need to have a separate battery for it you need to have one of these batteries this is a 9-volt battery so that should do the job perfectly that's the only Reggie that says actually so you have to get a few of those stacks up always at home that's the best thing that you have a couple at home in case one dating need eyes out that you have a spare one that you can continue recording but overall they're recording on that microphone is for I mean I sensed it it's for about 60 to 70 hours slice a lot that's quite a lot but they say 100 when it depends off of the usage but I i tested in about 60 to 1 2 70 hours that's what it will do for you with one battery what's not that it's really good because the batteries are not that expensive anyway and and you can just change them really easily and they said with the wind there's only problem this microphone is very sensitive so it's going to catch the wind very easily and it's going to make your video crap so be sure to have this little thing there that it protects you that it affects the quality of the video otherwise well it's going to be crapping in not going to be hurt so yeah but this will do it for this video if you have any questions be sure to put them down in the comment section down below I will answer to all of your questions if you have any and if I missed out a lot just let me know and I'll make a part or something and i'll explain it even in more depth that i did now and and yeah so whatever you want let me know in the comment section down below questions will be answered and i'll see you in the next video take here i'll see you next time bye [Music]
