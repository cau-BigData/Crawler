hello everyone today's like a really exciting day because this just came in the mail this is the iPhone se 2020 the new version of the se was updated finally after more than three years with the original released in 2016 so it's going to be an exciting version so of course I talked about this device on my channel for quite some time now and basically what it is it's the iPhone 8 with upgraded specs basically but there are many similarities to it so stay tuned for some reviews coming later in the coming days but this device features the processor as seen in the iPhone 11 series which means is going to be really fast so helped it for the 64 gigabyte version of course you can go higher than that but the price is really competitive and what I've been hearing on Twitter and everywhere is that basically many people are really switching to this device because of its size the touch ID and especially people who even have iPhone 11 pros they are going through this device just for its capabilities and its speed and also the size of the device alright let's get into the unboxing here it is this is the box of the iPhone se and as you can see it is actually quite thick its I was it's surprisingly thick I always thought it would be a little bit thinner but here we go let's open this iPhone up I'm really excited to like get into it so of course this is the red version I hope this for this version because it also helps part of the money that you spend on this iPhone helps the fight against the corona buyers so removing the box of course you have your paperwork on top of course this is a product red version so you have all that and everything here so basically here is the device and it's pretty much what you can expect it looks pretty much like the original iPhone 8 nothing really big deal here but it looks really nice like the iPhone 8 there really enjoyed it back then when I had this device and now with the nice glossy background with the red color it just looks amazing so of course you can also buy this in the white and black color which is quite cool for different tastes in color so let's go ahead and remove this and start putting fingerprints all over the iPhone because the glass just makes it so precious so here it is this is the device as you can see the screen is here of course you have your borders here which make it a little bit look older but the screen size is still okay the screen is still good with apples technology and you have the touch ID sensor which many people missed in the iPhone 11 and XS and lengths three generations back so we have of course the single lens camera with your flash over here so the camera has no improvements it is pretty much the same as on the iPhone 11 series except that now what was not on the iPhone 8 you are able to take portrait pictures with the selfie camera and portraits in general which make it a great addition of course you can also modify some of the pictures so with the a13 processor there are many changes to it to the software side so you can do a lot more when taking pictures so stay tuned for that video coming later in the week about how the cameras and just a review in general is so of course you have your buttons here the volume buttons you still remain with the Lightning port the speakers on the bottom which make it a great device to have so of course I miss the size I opted for the iPhone 11 Pro max this year and the size is effectively quite big so having a device this big in your hands just make it feel much better even though it's just the iPhone 8 but seeing it again a few years after makes it a really nice experience especially with the speed of the iPhone continuing on with the unboxing you will have your standard charging brick of course this is the Hong Kong version because I'm in Hong Kong so the UK plug which is this nice triangle-shaped thing and then you have your earbuds right here as well as the charging cable which is the lightning to USB it of course supports fast charging so if you're a fan of that it is here which is super great to see so yeah this is the unboxing of this amazing device it's actually really cool and I really like the red colour it just makes it so nice so the iPhone is all unboxed s'right over here as you can see it's not that big it's quite small it's a great size and I'm really excited to go and test his iPhone out so stay tuned for videos coming on this I'm really excited about this one but if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also follow me on Twitter for more recent updates and some cool pictures from this iPhone also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you my next video [Music] you
