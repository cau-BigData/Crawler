hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are going to take a look at the Apple watch Series 6 as well as watch a list seven Apple didn't announce any of these just yet but nine-to-five Mac has shared a few features and changes that might be coming to the 2020 Apple watch there are many hardware features coming to the watch including blood oxygen saturation monitoring and there are software features like the new watch faces and sharing of those watch faces let's start with the changes in the hardware but of course keep in mind that some of these might be delayed the first one being blood oxygen saturation monitoring which will keep track of your oxygen saturation but there is still one question that keeps it a mystery will it be only on the series 6 watch or will it be a software update for all recent watches well we don't really know but if you've been around Apple for some time you will know that they will use it as a reason for you to upgrade secondly there is going to be an update to the existing ECG feature there have been some limitations from where up to where you can measure but now you will be able to measure from very low heart rates to very high ones in the past with low heart rates or some above a hundred it would fail and the results would be inconclusive as you can see from these Apple is really starting to focus a lot on your health and health features in general many years back Apple released the reports saying that they have a specific lab that is developing and working on some health features one of the features and development is a non-invasive way of glucose monitoring for diabetes patients however no one is really talking about this for this year but it might be coming next year or in a few years from now another feature that I am really looking forward to is sleep tracking on the Apple watch but again this could be a software feature or an exclusive hardware feature on the series 6 watch last year we already got so many leaks that we thought it would be coming but this year 9 to 5 Mac has some very solid evidence that it is coming there will be the app with some data and a new complication that you can have on your Apple watch and if you heard Apple bought a company that made sleep tracking for the Apple watch called bet it so they must be very close to implementing this into the watch and I was 14 alright enough health let's take a look at some other features firstly you will be able to share your watch face with other people many people spend a lot of time to customize their watch faces so it would be really cool if they could then share it with their friends or family further we will see some new watch faces for example these that 9 to 5 Mac managed to discover these are flags from some countries which is quite cool you know that you can set pictures from your Photos app as an apple watch face well this year you will be able to create a shared folder for your watch face photos I would say that it would work like a shared folder through iCloud but who knows what Apple will come up with now for parents that have children with Apple watches you know that there is no parental control whatsoever on the iPhone there is screen time and other parameters where you can limit all kinds of things on your child's phone firstly as a parent you will be able to have a master iPhone which can have all the Apple watches of your children in one place it will not be only linked to the phone but fully managed by the phone for example you will be able to limit what apps your children can use on the Apple watch during what times very similar to what you can do on the iPhone in the control center on the Apple watch you will get some new toggles as every year you will be able to have the sleep tracking toggle for turning it on and off next you will be able to control noise detection so that you can turn it on and off when you need to so that it's not a pain in the ass instead of going into the settings on your iPhone finally if you remember last year Apple introduced the Apple Store to the Apple watch where you can basically get dependent apps on your watch instead of going through the iPhone however they were kind of an extension to the existing app on your iPhone however this year it'll be fully separate well this was fun if you enjoyed then please leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I will see you in my next video [Music]
