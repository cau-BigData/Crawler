all right so I've been getting ready to make this video this video is about how I deal with negativity you got that from the title so for me there are three main parts of dealing with negativity and these parts are online social media and people and laughter and I don't want to make this video too depressing or sad for any of the people who want to actually do YouTube or something online because a lot of hate and negativity comes with that from even people around you your friends their friends which actually care about you and there are friends which don't give an absolutely about you so let's talk about online first so there's a lot online there are many websites there are many things online that will show you and your negative sides and all of the crap that may or may not be true so to deal with that I honestly I it hits everyone and this video is about that that honestly negativity affects everyone even though many people don't want to admit it negativity and all negative comments hate comments everything like that it affects every single person and it affects you a lot actually and that's why negativity is a terrible thing and honestly I would prefer if someone just told you that to the face and not typing on a keyboard because they would not say that then and these people I know many people say that these people are just jealous and they're just they don't know what to do with their life but they're there and they hurt everyone's feelings including mine just online is the worst because people can hide behind the safety of their screens just ramble and hate and detest you and everything else like that and it's terrible okay I'm not against criticism that's besides the point but I just don't appreciate that I put a lot of work here and there are some people which is the minority which just treat you like absolutely now social media is the worst because social media it includes even YouTube comments let's put it that way it includes Twitter Instagram everything and there are just people will be there and we'll post comments which are insulting which are mean which basically attack you as a person honestly for those people who are watching who wanna hate or do whatever they want honestly I don't give it about you I just care about all the lovely people there are and that's the majority of the people but just don't hurt someone's feelings just put yourself in the shoes of that person and see how you would feel you would feel like YouTube I get comments which are and then I get comments on Twitter which are then I get comments on Instagram which are and honestly to process all of that it takes a tough brain and it takes a lot of strength to just disregard those comments and focus on the comments which are positive of the likes the people who appreciated the people who thanked you and just the people who actually care and our normal human beings that's what you have to filter and that's like the main point how to deal with negativity it's just look at the amount of people who support you who like what you're doing who thank you who leave likes comment really nice stuff which I really appreciate and those people are just great people and they show that they care about people but I just want to tell you how to deal with negativity and the people who are just entering the business of social media and YouTube and just all that be ready to be exposed from every side be ready to just lose everything you have all your freedom you have because there's gonna be people who are just gonna dig dig and find on you I usually don't swear in my videos it's gonna be beeped out but just I had to say it in this way because no other word explains what I'm feeling but let's just get into the third part and the third part is the people in general your fake friends and the people just outside who laugh at what you're doing because they're not doing anything with their life every time I vlog in public many shots that are not visible in the vlogs but on numerous occasions when you're vlogging in public there will be these groups which would be laughing at you which is just not motivating but you just push through it at least I just push through it because I know that on here there are people who actually want to see that and like love to see that and just spread positivity which is also my role as doing these videos is to spread positivity now then you have these fake friends we talked about they were your friends before you started doing these kind of things and all of a sudden when you start doing something with your life they're just gonna become jealous they're just gonna treat you like actual and they're not even gonna be your friends anymore and they'll always want something from you now these kind of friendships are just the worst and they don't deserve to exist and enjoy your friends who actually care about you and actually want to be with you and support you and they support you no matter what that's a real friendship so you're gonna end off like me we're just a couple of friends who actually know what you're doing and actually support you with what you're doing and enjoy watching your videos as well and they want to be in your videos and just those are the kinds of people who are really nice so I'm gonna leave it off at this if you to explain these points in more detail just leave a like comment down below your question you want to ask and I'll be sure to get back to it and and just reply to all of your questions and help you help the people who deal with these kind of things in their life so this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed I would be really happy if you liked the video and subscribe to my channel and also hit the little bell those
