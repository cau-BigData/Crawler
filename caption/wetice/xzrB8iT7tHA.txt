hello guys welcome back to another video today I would want to talk about the iPhone se and how it'll be actually great for Apple to release it and how it'll even help Apple itself there have been some rumors and I would like to talk about those plus how good it's gonna be for Apple to release this iPhone now if you're excited and leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest news about Apple and a bunch of other stuff let's get into the video as you know the iPhone se II was released in 2016 and the se was super good super fast just perform it and many people were getting it I know that se means special edition and it could only be a one-time thing but I believe that it may not only be a one-time thing as you know Apple isn't doing very well recently it had its worst holiday season and all of that so they're trying to focus on a lot of budget stuff in the recent months people don't really want to buy $1000 phones and they don't even upgrade so often so many people just stick with their iPhone 5 or with their iPhone 6 or 7 and just don't want to upgrade to the whole iPhone excess or excess Macs and even the XR is still at $750 which is not really a budget phone this is why I believe that the iPhone se 2 is on the way to come and save the day so iPhone XR was their budget phone in 2018 but as I said it's still quite expensive for what it is still at $749 as you know we are also rumored to be getting an iPad Mini 5 and an iPod Touch and a budget iPad during the March event so the iPhone se could be in the line as well as it would be part of the budget things I remember back in 2018 there have been many rumors about iPhone se too with a lot of concepts a lot of designs but lately we haven't been seeing too many of those which is on one hand kind of like well it may not be coming or it can just be Apple hiding it so secretly that it's gonna be a massive surprise so there is a slight possibility that we could be seeing this next month during the March event one more thing to prove what I'm saying is that the iPhone se the original one just had a clearance sale which is usually happening when they want to sell all of the stock they have and it doesn't really happen randomly they just don't want to just sell everything they have for our low price so it kind of makes it seem that a replacement is coming and they sold out quickly which shows Apple that the iPhone se has a demand let's talk about the design and all the features that the iPhone se2 might be having so I will probably still include a headphone jack and the home button as it's gonna be really a budget phone and will probably even not do an edge to edge display but it may just reduce the edges by a little bit I think also that we could be seeing a software-based home button instead of a mechanical one like on the iPhone 6 but we could be seeing a software one as on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 we would probably also see second generation of touch ID and we could probably see a bigger display with smaller bezels of course there has just been a report saying that the iPhone SE 2 will be pretty much the same size same design everything pretty much the same to the original se but just a tiny little bigger display going to 4.2 inches we should probably also see an a 12 Bionic chip since that's the most recent one Apple has released in their excess series with the XR as well so it would make sense to release a phone like this with an a12 Bionic the battery life was the biggest selling point for the iPhone when it originally came out in 2016 it had a battery of 1640 milliamp hours and it could be moving to 1700 1800 milliamps would you still make it an excellent battery for the phone size it is of course with every new update the camera will probably get improved or stay at 12 megapixels and we'll probably have a single lens I don't believe they're gonna go to dual lens or even a triple lens it just would not be realistic on such a budget phone where the camera will probably be seeing an improvement going from 4k 30 frames per second to 4k 60 frames per second which is just a minor change so there's a bunch of speculation that Apple could be replacing the iPhone se with the X are aligned so that they will do an xr2 which would be maybe even cheaper than the one we have now but we need to see what will actually happen until then we can only speculate but as you know the iPhone XR has a 6.1 inch display which can be big for some and also comes with a hefty price of $750 which isn't really a budget phone I think that up would really sell the iPhone se too very quickly as a cheap option for iPhones the price for the SE now is $399 for the 16 gigabytes and 499 for the 32 gigabyte model of the original ste the iPhone se 2 will probably be seeing an increase in size as I don't see Apple selling iPhones that are 16 gigabytes or 32 gigabytes in 2019 so we would probably be getting 64 gigabytes for $499 however Apple doesn't have to be scared about this as it will not replace the XR because there are still some people who want to have a bigger screen and they can just go and pay the extra $250 to get the iPhone XR which has a bigger screen so anyway this is all just speculation Apple just may be keeping this a secret or it may not even happen at all but we know that Apple will come out with budget iPads iPhones and more which will pretty much help Apple as they're a really expensive phones aren't gonna do it but anyway like if you liked and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
