hello today is great day it is a great day because actually I'm back at the studio recording videos makes me super happy after the last 50 days I'm not doing anything and today I'm coming back with another tech video an unboxing video and that's this this is the Google chromecast so just like by looking at like the box it's really kind of similar to the box of the Google home Mini you just have all the applications and companies that are supported by the this device so that you can stream which is really important for stuff like Netflix YouTube CBS Pandora a Spotify Hulu HBO Facebook I really really impressive let's see what it is I got this off of Amazon and I am excited to unbox it just top off the box here we go there's nothing absolutely nothing here we just have a small paper then it's oh my god whoa I thought it would be like the size of the box it's literally this look at compared to my hand this is what it is II I wasn't expecting this like to be honest I did not expect it to be this tiny look at my hand look at this thing it's extremely tiny where compared like to the box well I guess yeah it makes sense based on the box but on all the advertisement pictures and everything they showed like the gigantic thing and this is small but I'm not complaining it's quite good at its small but it's just like a surprise right so then we have a small leaflet inside so small leaflets saying getting started this is interesting getting started HDMI chromecast comes set up plug into TVs which TVs but say that's gonna be a whole separate video how to set this thing up I'm gonna rather keep this now we have another cable here this is pretty much a USB I don't even know what cable but this is like the standard Android cable so actually it seems to be quite long which is actually ideal for plugging it and powering it otherwise it would be just a waste because sometimes you have the power input on the floor and it has to get yeah it's it's quite long it's a long cable they're not stingy so as I believe this is pretty much going to plug into into here presume yeah that's plugging in there so that's your charger that's your HDMI port that goes into the TV and then it works apparently and that's pretty much everything in the box I believe this is worthless this is worthless yeah so we just have that this and a paper so it's gonna be part two how to set this thing up but I was really surprised that actually it's this miniature I thought it would be a lot bigger and if it works I'll be surprised if it works the way I anticipate hmmm we'll see we'll have to see we'll have to see for that so this is the end of the video stream on and enjoy your day I hope you enjoyed this video if you did leave a like down below and subscribe this will be changing a lot in the future I have many things to announce that many things to talk about but I just wanted to do this quick little video because this came in while I was not here so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
