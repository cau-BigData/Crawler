hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we are going to take a look at a tweet by mark gurmann who is from Bloomberg giving us some interesting and exciting news about new products coming this week I know this week that means before the actual special event on the 25th of March but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more so mark Gherman tweeted if Apple was to be planning say new iPad and iMac announcements for this week it would make a real statement about how much it wants to focus its March 25th event on its news and subscription services this is exciting and this is coming from a very trusted source from Bloomberg by Mark Garmin however at first glance might seem as it doesn't give much detail but it actually lines up with what we have heard in the past we know that Apple will not release any new hardware during their March event right yeah so the street just confirmed what we thought what I mean with that is we knew that some products would be coming but we thought they would come after the event rather than before the street says that Apple wants to release new products before the actual event to be able to focus on their subscription services at the event this makes a lot of sense Apple will mainly talk about their TV and new subscription services therefore it is very likely to see the iPads and imacro refreshes this week now you might be asking when well if the tweet is accurate that it could be announced at the beginning of this week and released by the end it is highly possible and I am really really really excited as see but there is a one more thing what about the air pods - an air power the street doesn't talk about it at all right now I am really confused and kind of sad as I was expecting these products but for now all we can really do is wait and hope to see something cool and even with some luck we would see air pods - or just the wireless air pots - and air power otherwise it would be a bummer well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know if you will be getting the new iPad or the iMac or both in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch bunch of bunch more okay take care and I will see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music]
