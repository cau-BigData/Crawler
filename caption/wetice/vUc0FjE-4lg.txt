hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we are taking a look at a new report about the iPhone X I there are great news for some but bad news for the other also Apple has chosen the design for their 2019 iPhone let's go and take a look but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do go leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple knows and a bunch more in the past we have already seen two different prototypes of iPhones this one and this one the designs are completely different however today we have a new report from Mac Takara saying that Apple chose the first prototype now I don't know how I feel about this as it will bring a massive change to the iPhones the first prototype has three cameras in a square whereas the second prototype has three of them in the middle I personally prefer the second prototype we should be seeing the smaller bezels and a smaller knotch however the front of the first prototype is unknown this could potentially mean that it would be the same as iPhone X s but this is only what I think on leaks reacts to this on Twitter by saying that the render is inaccurate and Apple has both of them still on the table I also know that as the first prototype went around the internet not many people liked it therefore I am really hoping that we see the second prototype as it would look more like an iPhone rather than an Android so this is really some unexpected news but we should know for sure in just a couple of months now I would love to hear what you think about this news in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more in another tweet on leek says that the coating on the back should be very different from what we have been seeing on the iPhone it should be less frosted and have a better grip this is something I would love also if they added a more resistant back that doesn't break easily I would take it out of the cover but for now it stays inside Matt Katara goes on further by saying that the triple camera setup should be available on all of the versions of iPhone basically it will not only be on the top version of the iPhone I'm really happy for this as I wouldn't want to pay for a bigger screen to get three cameras well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about all of this news in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news wow it will be a massive year for the iPhone night I can see it we will potentially get an iPhone that doesn't resemble any of its predecessors enough speculation and rambling take care and I will see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] you
