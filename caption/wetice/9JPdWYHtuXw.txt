Wow I guess it's dozen 18 now it's not 2017 anymore so that's something we have to get used to and that's a year that I think I will remember now the reason why I say it doesn't 18 will be here I'll remember because what they have planned already is amazing really amazing so I cannot say much because then to ruin the entire surprise but what I can say is that there's gonna be something in March there's gonna be something in April there's gonna be something in June and July and that's about it for now and then something in December yep so there's a lot planned now I've wrote some things down on my phone in notes because my memory is like terrible and for the purpose of this video it's gonna be a lot more smooth when I know what I'm talking about so about the schedule that's what I say every year now it's gonna be the same vlogs three times a week maybe like one video during the week or whenever I want some kind of tech review or I don't know whatever something like that something different or I don't know who come up with something for sure then in 2017 my channel grew like a crap-ton so that was impressive so we're gonna continue that in 2018 because I'm pretty sure it's gonna be even a better and better then 2017 yeah so that's confusing this year but it's gonna be a lot better I have many video ideas planned I kind of found style I want to do 2017 helped me with that so basically now I know what I want to record we are like gonna episode I don't know like 15 No a vlog so let's get I don't know to a hundred by the end of the year that's possible and that's the actual plan to just get to there and grow because we're at like 2,000 views a month now so that happened in like less than six months or no it's gonna be even six months not a year so yeah that's that that's done oh and maybe there will be some things left and right I don't know some fun things we're gonna do I may create a website I don't know it's all yeah it's all a blog or something that's something I've been also wanting to start to do but we'll see about that how the your progress is and then I can choose what I want to do but yeah I still can't believe that 2017 is like out and now it still does an 18 because it seemed to be like that I'm very grateful for all of you this is just something I wanted to say and that's it so enjoy all the videos coming there's one more video of our ski ship after this and that's it I promise and then we'll continue with the vlogs amazing ones and then we're going somewhere in March beginning of March so I'm gonna announce that around the end of February and it's my birthday soon also so Wow a bunch of crap coming so be sure to tune into all of those vlogs and I'll see you in my next one alright take care bye
