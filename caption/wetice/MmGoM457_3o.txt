hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some interesting things to talk about we have new 2019 iPhone X I and iPhone excite to rumors and iOS 13 emojis that were confirmed let's talk about all this but if you're excited and leave a like down below and consider subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news let's start with the 2019 iPhones we should be seeing a 14 megapixel camera on the back and we have seen how one of the iPhones in 2019 will look like based on the screenshot from on leaks and compared Raja we also will be seeing a front-facing camera which will be 12 megapixels and also the notch will be getting smaller the phone will be completely redesigned as well and we know all this seven months before it should be released in September we have a new report from droid shout this is an Android leaks website which didn't really talk about iPhones in the past and I don't know if we should trust it or not but we still have quite some interesting details they say we should be seeing a smaller notch as well as a new color option we should be seeing green in the 2019 iPhones and it should replace one of the colors that we've been seeing let me know which color you think it's gonna be and let me know if you think that the green color is realistic in the comments down below we should be seeing and improved grip and scratch resistance which is great I mean the scratch resistance it'll be great to see as iPhones get scratched quite easily and the grip well I haven't been having too many issues with the grip so far all of them seem quite fine in my hands no issues there now one thing that the Wall Street Journal talked about is that we should be seeing only the triple camera on the iPhone X I'm Mac which is kind of disappointing as Apple would charge $100 more just to have a triple camera setup which is just I don't know how I feel about that also we've heard this from multiple sources which means that this may actually be true now nothing happened yet we're still seven months before the actual release so this all may change and we may be seeing something completely different here the pricing will be the same at least what droids shout says the iPhone XR 2 will be at $749 the iPhone excite 999 dollars and the iPhone X IMAX at $1,099 all this is based on droid shout support now there was another report from The Wall Street Journal not only about the 2019 iPhones but also about the 2020 I phones we have heard a lot from Bloomberg as well about the 2020 I phones having a 3d laser camera and just having all three models have an OLED this would be super interesting as there is a big difference between the LCD displays and the OLED displays and it's even noticeable to the eye so in 2020 we should be finally seeing all of the models on OLED screens that'll be super exciting to see as all of you would be able to get an OLED screen now let's get into the fun stuff so emoji PDA has many samples now of the new 2019 emojis that will be most likely included in iOS 13 this website is almost always accurate on all these emojis so we should be seeing all of these and there will be a bunch of new emojis 250 plus emojis we should be seeing in the new 2019 update for the first time ever we should be seeing accessibility emojis which would have people in wheelchairs maybe some people who have some disabilities would be able to communicate with emojis that would be super cool to see let's talk about a few of the emojis let me scooch over we have this yawn emoji here which is super interesting to see the next we have emojis with legs which is something we would see again and holding hands emojis we should be seeing some new animals on this image here you will see many animals and much more so all these emojis should be coming if you want to check out all of the emojis just go to emoji PDA and you can see all the new emojis that you can be used in the Iowa's 13 update but anyway this is it for now this is all we've seen so far there's much more coming for sure and still were seven months ahead of schedule for the iPhones and we've seen so much already but anyway like if you like and subscribe to stay updated and learn more about all the latest Apple news anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music]
