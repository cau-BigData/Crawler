hello welcome this is the fourth of September this video today normally should have been a tech Tuesday video but unfortunately or fortunately it's the third year I'm vlogging anniversary type of thing I know it's the third year it seemed like it passed so quickly like I remember myself doing this video in 2017 and it's another year Wow it's a third year I'm logging the third or second wait hold up hold up hold up cuz in 2016 2017 28th this is the third year yes alright so third year anniversary of this amazing event that actually changed my entire channel and I'll never stop mentioning and kind of celebrating this even though I may skip next year because it's gonna become kind of awkward but it's just impressive how three years ago I just took my camera and just went into it and just beam like first vlog of super shy just not perfect in front of a camera I was always holding the camera away from me and everyone wanted the camera to go on me and even since I was young I hated being filmed and like taking photographs and stuff like that even though I still hate taking photographs but I make videos so I mean it's good it's awkward but I never loved I never liked being second on camera I'm like captured and memories and there's like a blank from 2014 when I was really young to now yeah I mean there's a jump but now here I am in 2018 sitting in front of the camera talking to me talking to a camera alone it seems awkward everyone thinks it's awkward talking to a camera just like that but there I know that there are people behind the camera that are watching it's oh it's a very interesting feeling to explain and I bet if there are any small youtubers and and many other youtubers watch me feel the same way and if you're not a youtuber you're just watching this video because you clicked on it but I'm very grateful for it then you should actually try put yourself in front of a camera for the first time and talk it's not a pleasant and it's a difficult and weird experience it's it's like you go in front of a camera and you're like I hate cameras now I'm in front of it that was me three years ago now I love cameras I mean there's just cameras all over me there's this here then there's like another camera and then film non-stop I'm filming all the time so it's a big life change that happened three years ago there was like the first time I revealed my face or whatever and it was just interesting when I recorded the video I recorded four times and I watched them and I never liked them then I mean I don't like them now but back then up to the fourth child actually enjoyed it and then I was editing it and I was looking at myself and it felt so awkward looking at myself and anything myself and listening to myself watching myself it was just a very interesting experience Wow yeah and and we progressed until here where I'm just you know like whatever in front of a camera I can do whatever you turn on the air conditioning just you get it it's a big change and even like a life change because you're in front of a camera almost permanently I'm always talking to myself which seems like a mental condition but it's not I'm talking to you through the camera and that's just something that many people don't understand that when I'm vlogging in public the amount of stairs I get the amount of like people who look into the camera and they're like what the hell is that guy doing and then I have fun in the editing looking at all those people who are basically being watched by many other people through my channel and maybe they can watch themselves but that's highly highly unlikely it's just a very interesting experience but anyway I am very thankful for this past three years we grew so much and I cannot say that much I cannot say that too many times I just appreciate it so much I love doing this I hope I can continue doing this for another 10 years let's say that'll be 13 years I just love it I just love doing all these videos they just fulfill me and and just make me happy every day if I come here and I record and then I go edit and I just click the publish button and when I was publishing my friend's vlog I was just like oh no oh no what will people say and that's like negativity but that's for another video and how I deal with it because there are many negative comments on my channel even in different languages saying many many like mean things and many like squares and cursing and and just like is it Pleasant no will you continue yes do I care about your haters no I don't care but that's besides this video I'm gonna make a whole video about that next time or another time that's actually a good idea how to deal with negativity but this was just a video to tell you and kind of remember three years ago and and just say thank you so this is it thanks for watching if you leave if you enjoyed this video leave a like and subscribe will be greatly appreciated I love every single one subscriber and every single positive comment anyway now let's leave it on that I'll see you next time bye [Music]
