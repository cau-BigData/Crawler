what's up guys Apple released I was 13 point 5 and iPad OS 13.5 one month after thirteen point four point one we're going to take a look at everything that's new the performance the battery life the bug fixes and more we're also going to take a look at whether or not you should update so starting off the update came in at about 400 megabytes if you're coming from thirteen point four point one of course this was the developer beta the developer GM bill that came out yesterday so that was four gigabytes so of course they'll depend on which software version you're coming from and which device you have for iPad OS it was around three hundred fifty megabytes of course coming from thirteen point four point one so if we head over into settings and general and the About section we can see that we're running 17 f7 five that's the build number right over here and it's of course the same build number as on the developer GM release now if we had a little lower the modem firmware it's new it's 1.0 6.00 so if you had any connectivity issues on thirteen point four point one then those should help fix them so what's new of course the main change in this update are the kovat nineteen related features so the first change is the contact tracing which can be found in privacy and health and as you can see right here this is the covert nineteen exposure logging this gives you an explanation under so when enabled iPhone can exchange or random IDs with other devices using Bluetooth this enables an app to notify you if you may have been exposed to covert 19 exposure logging cannot access any data in or add data to the health app so this gives you kind of an explanation of what it is of course this is not available in every region there's a little more explanation here so if you're in a region where it's supported you'll have some more explanation there you can just click to learn more down here so there are no apps just yet so you cannot enable it but those should be coming pretty soon as well further many people are concerned about their privacy and rest assured it is safe and it won't be collecting your personal data the next new feed is in FaceTime so if we head over into the settings of FaceTime which are right down here so under the face ID setting there's a new feature right here under automatic prominence and that is the speaking so during group FaceTime calls the title of the person speaking will automatically become larger so of course you can disable that if you don't want your face to get bigger during FaceTime calls another health feature is in health under medical ID this of course is not available in all regions but certain regions you can share your medical ID during an emergency call which is something quite good we also have a fix for the text character bug you know that you can see on Twitter or everywhere there would be a text that would crash your device or the app or even sometimes you'd have to fully reboot the device also there is a nice addition to Apple music for those that use Apple music you can share songs on Instagram on your story where it adds a link so everyone can click and go to that music further there is a face ID change when you're wearing a mask so when wearing a mask it will open the passcode screen immediately instead of just trying to loop through the face ID and then doing that so it skips a little bit of wait time to get into your device the VPN bugs still might be here we have no news whether that was fixed or not Apple didn't mention if this issue was fixed so we don't know yet until it'll be fully fixed so regarding the bugs the only bug that I can still see here is in the mail app some people have badges showing emails but then when they go into the app there's no email showing up so they have to refresh to actually get it and on top of it some people also have duplicate emails so there will probably be no fix for this until I was 14 but this is the biggest issue otherwise I don't have any bugs also there doesn't seem to be any problems with cellular or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or anything regarding connectivity now what about the performance and battery life so the performance is good thirteen point five has a good performance the Geekbench scores are a little higher than on iOS thirteen point four point one which is good and then the performance is a little bit smoother and more stable further since the bugs were fixed it will make the experience much better regarding battery life we had over there battery life I didn't really notice any significant difference but of course that will depend on your device and on your battery health and many other factors of how you use your device for me no big difference in day-to-day usage so should you update - I was 13.5 yes you should you have new features for easier and locking with a mask the covert 19 tracing app and so much more as well as medical ID features and the music-sharing further performance is better but battery life remains the same well if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I released my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up there okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] [Music]
