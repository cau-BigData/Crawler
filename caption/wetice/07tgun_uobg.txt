hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today let me know in the comments down below I am great but today we're recording another video and I'm super excited for that piece like something it's so warm here anyway today we're going to talk about airport and airplane travel Hawks now these are important for me and they may be as important to you as they are to me because they are some hacks that save a lot of time save a lot of money now one is checking online it's very easy if you have an internet connection which probably you do since you're watching this video and basically if you just have a carry-on it saves a buttload of time you just go directly to that security you can choose your seat sometimes it's free sometimes you pay some money for it but it all depends on the airline company you're flying with but overall it's awesome to save a lot of time now pack snacks and drinks now drinks you'll not pass through security now because of water and you cannot carry all that but snacks I'm pretty sure that if you put them in your carry-on I think you will pass with your snacks no problem with that but you have to be careful about customs in some places if you're taking I don't know something from from your country and you fly somewhere where it's like yeah whatever just be careful about customs now one thing that I really recommend is don't take a black bag now that's even from my experience always think about this flashy red yellow or something crazy a crazy color because then you will be able to locate it when they're going on the whatever the conveyer belt and you can find it easily and spot the yellow than black because everyone has black suitcases toulon yeah you may just think someone else's suitcase and that's not very and he'll take yours now one thing that's super cool is if you haven't feared what your boss will be for security like you just drink you're both right and just put it in your bag you're gonna pass you'll pass security easily and then you can fill up the bottle and like in the in the restroom with water so that's fine if your watch is drinkable by the way and it reduces your expenses because probably the water after security is quite expensive so you just save a lot of money like this now one thing that I like is to dress in layers so basically if you put layers they're easy to remove they're easy to add to yourself so you can easily remove and add layers because sometimes it's warm in the plan sometimes it's freezing cold in the plane so that's easy now one thing this is stupid and completely stupid don't be three hours before the plane takes off at the airport this is just everyone says this but is absolutely stupid because two hours is enough really trust me two hours is enough we usually go like one and a half hour in advance and we like have to still wait for like a half an hour so three hours is just way too much unless you're unless you're gonna like buy every product in the duty-free but I don't know that's just way too long before the flight but anyway guys this is the trans video if you enjoyed and if you use some of these hacks and you know them yourselves let me know in the comment section down below and anyway leave a like and subscribe if you enjoyed and if you want some content like this and take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Applause] [Music]
