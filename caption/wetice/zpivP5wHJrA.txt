hello guys welcome back to another video today is another interesting day because we're gonna talk about some more Apple but this time we're gonna talk about the latest iOS twelve point one point one release which is now out for everyone so if you want to go download it go ahead and in this video I'll tell you why alright so right here is the release log for iOS twelve point one point one and there are some things here that I will cover and there are some things that I'll cover that are out of this list now the first thing is that you've got some extra storage space when updating so they optimized a little bit the iOS software so there's a little bit more storage for you there it's about one gigabyte or so now there has been an update in the haptic touch for the iPhone XR in the notifications tab so pressing all the notification you're going to open up you can reply to a message you can do all the bunch of things that are available on the iPhone XS and X s max so that something does has been upgraded and works a lot better now so continuing down the list as you can see dual SIM and ECM for additional carriers an iPhone XR XS and exists Macs now finally the dual SIM has been released so you can go and get a physical sim or an e sim that will work with your phone on the iPhone XR XS and XS max however beware that not all the carriers are supporting and right now it's gonna start rolling out slowly in the next coming months mostly starting in the US and then continuing all over the world so that's something to keep in mind you cannot go in to your carrier store right now and purchase a Nissen because they may not be available yet now one interesting thing here is that if you're calling as you can see this is not is twelve point one point one this is to a point one point one so as you can see the whole layout of FaceTime has been changed a little bit and the one main feature here is that you can flip the screen just by tapping here on the bottom which was actually in the past you have to go look for it over here and then go flip over there so that's something that is nice and improved that gives you better it's just better for for calling and it works really well now another thing is you can take live photos and this is this button right over here which basically allows you to take pictures while you're calling so that's me right here now and if I want to take a picture so basically I would click this however you see that FaceTime photos must be enabled on both devices to use this feature so this is something that has to be set in advance so if you want to call with your friends and you want both of you to take pictures or on the you take pictures both devices have to be on iOS twelve point one point one otherwise it's just not going to work but this is a great feature implemented the flippin easy access and the taking pictures it's really good to know one really minor feature here is that the Apple watch application picture has been changed just a tiny little bit it's not very noticeable but you can see that this was the previous three third generation and here you have the Apple watch design that's the fourth generation this is just kind of a nice small feature to see that Apple has implemented the last feature that was updated is the option to hide the sideburn the news on iPad in landscape orientation so that is a very simple feature just by tapping this on top click and you can have a nicer range to read your stories and so on so like very simple feature here that works really well and makes the news even better well now is it time to update yes it's a massive update even though it's on a small number there are a ton of changes ton of bug fixes ton of security updates and the performance is great so me I'm very happy with iOS 12 point one point one and I would really hope that you're gonna update because it's fairly important to do so and I hope the new betas will come fairly soon and I'm really excited so stay tuned and I'll see you in my next video but if you enjoyed this one leave a like and subscribe and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
