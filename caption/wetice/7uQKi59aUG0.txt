hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today today is another great day to record a video because today I'm going to answer another question that I have in the description today's question will be how I edit and how I organize the videos after recording it so I'm going to have kind of like two parts I'm showing four fingers but reconnect two parts kind of how I organized that I'll show you how I kind of edit but we'll see how that goes so after putting the SD card into my computer oh yeah just like the key in it I'm going to import the files and I'm going to put them to whatever year it is so this series 2017 so we opened the folder I have multiple photos depends where I go during the year so those are like separate folders and then I have a good videos folder looks like all of the videos for for you know the months that are not like vlogs or travel videos let's say that I'm recording now for October so I'm going to click on October and I'm gonna click on how I organize my videos so I'm going to double click on the folder and just import the file into the folder so let's just take an example of the previous video so as you can see here this one is from a camera this one is the screen capture from OBS and then as you can see this one with the date is the edited video and then I have the two one thumbnail and second thumbnail will also have a time step of the day so that way I can find thumbnail easily so that is the thumbnail and then in each folder you have basically the save of the editing so that's quite simple I guess and that works for every single video that I have here I found like a great method and I from like January as you can see like January here I kind of have the different days but I don't I don't even know what I was doing in January because but it doesn't make sense but anyway I really started doing it in like July June or something I think I don't know I remember but as you can see each of them have the day for me I always put my ideas into folders so I have the folders and the ones they're empty I just know that I have to edit the video and the ones that have like a sometimes in pre record and I don't I did so the way I know that is when there's this kind of premiere you know project kind of addicted thing then then I can see at each folder has it and then I know that I edited it so that's kind of little why did I know that it's edited now for the editing part so let's say I'll take last week's video open project full file okay so here as you can see I have the project open so this is where I edit the video so I use Premiere Pro I find it a great editing software and it's just great and I used many different software's like Vegas before I used even Camtasia and movavi so I mean I and I even used iMovie first so I kind of progressed eventually but I have an easy style of editing so it depends on the video but like geoguessr is a little more complex than other videos but you know that I like each end of the video is the same with my outro so that's not different so you know you have like the music that says blank that's this here there you go and then you have like my outro with the music playing and then it goes all the way to by and my outro so that like something that I have already I haven't already say from another project and that's just I added to the every time so that's just perfect to kind of edit the video and then from there I just upload it to YouTube so that's simple as that so I hope this explained this question and I did my best to to kind of explain it in the best way I could but this was a choice video if you enjoyed be sure to LIKE down below and subscribe for more videos and in the future they'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video on Wednesday take care and I'll see later bye [Music]
