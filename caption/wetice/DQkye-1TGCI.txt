hello everyone and welcome back to another video we are about a month away from the rumored March event and we have quite a lot of evidence that a marsh event is on the way because of the numerous different products they're rumored to be coming within the next few months we should be seeing the iPhone se - the new iPad pro new earphones by Apple a red Apple watch a new 13-inch MacBook Pro a new Apple TV and a wireless charger and of course the Apple air tags to track your item Wow let's take a look at all of these the headlining product of course of the March event will be definitely the new iPhone se - or called the iPhone 9 we don't know yet what the name will be and no sources seem to agree these images are official images from the design that on leaks managed to find this is pretty much how it will look like it will be a new iPhone 8 with upgraded specs but nothing visible on the outside on the inside there will be a a 13 processor a better camera touch ID maybe a bigger battery and much more the price for the iPhone will be between 400 and 500 dollars which is quite a good price considering phones at $1000 today for quite some time we have been hearing about a product red apple watch an apple news website found code on Apple's website which proved that a new red Apple watch would be coming very soon there will be no spec difference and most likely no price difference either it will be purely a red series 5 Apple watch what about the new Apple TV we have a new report from 9 to 5 Mac that found code in TV OS 13 point for being related to a new Apple TV there will most likely be no exterior changes but it will definitely improve gameplay from the Apple arcade there will most likely be no price difference so if you want to buy an Apple TV then you should wait a couple more months late last year we got a new 16 inch MacBook Pro which finally fixed the horrendous keyboard that was present on the previous Mac books now we are hearing about a new 13 inch MacBook Pro that will potentially have slimmer bezels and might get sighs increase to 14 inches of course you will be able to get better specs and you will have the good keyboard that was introduced on the 16 inch macbook pro we have been hearing that the iPad pro will be coming with three cameras it really looks like we will see the three of them and most sources are starting to agree it is rumored that we will get a 3d time-of-flight camera which will definitely make picture capturing capabilities and much better this feature was originally a rumored to be coming on the iPhone 12 later this year but now it seems that do come on the iPad pro first it will of course have a faster processor and some more RAM but the major change will be the camera finally we will also be able to track our items like keys with Apple's new tile trackers they are most likely going to be called air tags you can put it on an item you want to track and then use your find my app or use augmented reality to find your items once you find it a red balloon will show up which is really really cool what about the earphones it is rumored that Apple will make their own earphones Pro they will not be made by Beats but by Apple themselves they will most likely be Wireless they will have noise cancellation and some similar features as the air plants Pro these headphones will deliver amazing sound quality but at a quite high price a recent patent that Apple made suggests that they could have a touchscreen on the side of the earphones which is just quite impressive however other features are not known and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing these remember last year when we considered air power being dead well it might not be so dead just yet if you remember Apple wanted to release a wireless charger that could charge your iPhone your Apple watch and air pods all at the same time however they had to delay it numerous times and gave up because it kept overheating and could potentially damage your devices now Apple is rumored to be coming with a new wireless charger that will be able to charge your phone and air pods or your phone and your watch this information was brought by Ming Chico on 95 Mac and he has got a near-perfect record about Apple's future well there is a lot coming within the next few months if you enjoyed this video then please do leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously also if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here thank you very much and I'll see my next video [Music] you [Music]
