hello guys welcome back to the second video today I would want to talk about the Apple March 2019 event which we talked about in all of my previous videos we knew it was coming this spring and has been confirmed by this BuzzFeed report however the BuzzFeed report talks about the date what is gonna be announced and I'm not really impressed about what's gonna be announced as it's pretty disappointing to say the least if you're excited anyway then drop a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more of other content based on BuzzFeed we should have the March event on the 25th of March so some of the sources that said we should be having some products before well I don't know which one to take seriously now however it was supposed to be really cool releasing air power air pots to the iPad Mini and a 10 inch iPad and a bunch more stuff however based on BuzzFeed's report it's gonna be a little bit less than that so as you know Apple has been working on their TV show and movie subscription which is something they talked about in the past and something they wanted to get into so it's gonna be something similar to Netflix with some original Apple content and they may talk about this during the event however it would seem stupid to just host an event to talk about their Apple news subscription and TV show subscription all that that would be just dumb it'll take probably like 20 minutes however the main focus of this show based on BuzzFeed's report is the news subscription service which again why would they host an event just for a 10 minute long event just talking about their new subscription well I don't know however on leaks and BuzzFeed talked about this as well that air pods - will not be coming as they should come in the fall which is something I've been super excited about BuzzFeed however did not talk about air power and the 10 inch iPad so this might still be coming however it's unsure and for sure we will not be seeing airports to at least was these two sources say but we will be seeing a wireless charging case for the original version of air pods I don't know how I feel about this let me know down in the comments how you feel about all of these things because I just no comment for me honestly but if all this is true this event will be pretty boring just to the subscription however I'm still crossing my fingers hoping they were still gonna get air putts - and a bunch more things but that will have to wait until the event itself iPad Mini 5 is as welcome to be postponed apparently to the fall based on BuzzFeed and on leaks I don't know how to feel about any of this however what we know for sure is that there is an event in March but anyway just keep in mind all of these are rumors so it may not be true when we can still hope for the best but anyway like if you like and subscribe to stay updated about all the latest Apple news and a bunch more content anyway take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music]
