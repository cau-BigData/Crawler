all right hello and welcome back to another video how are you today as you can see we are in Zanzibar you solid probably from the previous video if you watched it as we arrived here and today I would want to do something that I did not want to do home because it was just different so today I'm actually going to read your comments and your input on my videos that I post I really love your comments you know that I respond to almost all of them unless they're dumb or if I have nothing to answer but most of them are answerable and I answer so let's start reading them I'm gonna start with the first one kind of classical with many of you guys put on my channel and it's like nice video from a girl osh really thank you for that I really appreciate it and then you know I have the geoguessr videos and all of you comment about how stupid I was with the signs and I don't know what and how I failed completely so I really appreciate that how you do that and then I just read how stupid I am but that's a really fun there are many of those for example Zoe Zoe politely I I'm sorry for reading of the name wrong there are many people like this who posed and I'm really grateful for that then I have people who really like get into the topic of the video so for example metal detecting South in Netherlands posted great video made them sub thank you very much and I have I have camera two since two weeks it's awesome and so on so I really appreciate those kind of comments where you put an input to the video that I posted and may you talk about the same topic that I talked there so that's really something I really like really something I really like okay so then I have many comments like perfect I really appreciate those because that really motivates me and that I see that you guys actually like what I post another one is like someone who asks more about the video and I always say that if I talk about a very hard topic that really leave comments if you want to ask questions I did not answer in the video so for example vidi productions ask what lens you used well I answered we we talked a little bit but that's it basically I really like to answer your questions if I do not answer them in the video so that's really really good now this really this comment really hit me because it was from Dominica splash what do you have less than 200 subs you're so nice I really thank you a lot I don't know I'm trying my hardest I'm growing slowly but I don't know but thank you for that comment really appreciated that and that really hit me and that's something I really like that you like watching my video now for example the comment I mentioned that something I don't want to reply to or something I don't have to reply to why didn't you get the 5d Mark 3 instead the real pro camera with studying pictures one it's like $2,000 more expensive than the 60 mark 2 so that's like the first factor if you own the answer and also the 60 mark 2 is really great for what I do and is I don't need the 5d Mark 3 so are you happy now whoever you are nature good and then I have those comments like good video bro from pigeon James really appreciate that then from Jack Karoubi crew keep it up man keep trying to do new stuff and keep creating that's what I love doing creating I create a lot thank you for that did really a prior really appreciate that comment then I have from Iceland why awesome channel just sub these are comments I really liked when you subscribe leave a comment that I know who you are who subscribed because in the subscribe when I click who are my subscribers I never know who is the newest one whatever it's just confusing so just leave a comment and I know who you are who actually subscribe to my channel and then I have comments from mr. bass boost who actually commented on many many of my videos great keep it up excellent video keep it up that really motivates me a lot to make even more content so thank you mr. bass boost I really appreciate those kind of comments it motivates me to do more and create more and that's where I am here because of all your support so this is where I'll conclude the video so if you enjoyed be sleeve like down bow and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another video so actually yeah okay from Zanzibar bye [Music] Oh
