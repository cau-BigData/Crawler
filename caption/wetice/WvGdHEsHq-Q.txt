hello everyone welcome back to another video today is a really exciting day as we have some more rumors about the upcoming Apple releases air pots - are set to be in production and a new red version of the iPhone XS should be available by the end of the month in China if you're excited then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news also what do you think about these releases would they make sense let me know in the comments down below in the past few months there were many conflicting rumors about the air pods to some sources said they were not coming some said they will not come in spring but in fall and some said that they are delayed with all these sources it is very hard to make sense out of it but today we have a new report from the Economic Daily News which is a very good Chinese news website this report claims that airports too are in production and are coming in the spring of 2019 as you know Apple is holding an event rumored to be on March 25th that should be pretty boring as far as we know Apple will mostly talk about their subscription services and probably won't release any new products just boohoo however there is still hope as they are already in production we are still more than a month away from the actual event even if Apple decides not to release products during this conference they will probably be available just after or sometime in April economic Daily News continues by saying that there will be a new color option as firstly reported by my smart price this is good as two sources finally agree many of us own air pods as Apple has sold a lot of them in the past year so you might be asking why should we buy the new air Potts good question thank you for asking the new air pause will come with hands-free Siri a new finish maybe some health features better audio with a focus on the bass and a new black color but is this enough to upgrade well I'll take the upgraded sound quality and a new color still I think there will be a few more features that will make it worth your hard-earned money also many sources now say that the air pods will be coming in spring therefore I think it's safe to say that on leaks which previously tweeted that they will be coming in the fall of 2019 is wrong but still nothing is known many of us have been waiting for air power which is a charger that can charge all three of your most loved devices well economic Daily News says it will be coming alongside the air pods to basically in the spring of 2019 are you excited for this because I am let me know in the comments down below and by leaving a like there's this one tweet on Weibo which is a Chinese social media site saying that Apple is going to release a red version for the iPhone XS further that they will be on the shelves only in China by the end of this month however there is one problem this source is not verified probably not trustworthy so this is unrealistic that this will happen this month but it is likely that we'll be seeing a red color in spring as Apple did that for the past two years in a row still probably in like April or May on top of that this version is supposed to be only in China I highly doubt that but again Apple has to work on their market in China as the iPhones are not doing too well over there on top of that the price is too high and I don't see how a red version will change that anyway I would love to see your input in all of this down in the comments like if you like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news okay take care and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
