hello everyone and welcome back to another video we previously looked at some great iOS 13 features and today we're going to look at some of the bad ones some of the worst features or some of the missing features that would have made iOS 13 even better now let's see it started with this list first of all if we head over into the App Store which is one really annoying change as you can see in the bottom here we have five tabs we have today games apps arcade and search now one job that's missing is the update step and for me I use the update tab quite often when looking at different updates changes before I actually update it but it was replaced by the arcade so to go and find the Updates tab you have to go click on your profile and then go down over here so you go down over here and this is what actually updates which is super annoying and this is your update step pretty much hidden away I mean it could have been worse but it's still not that very good another feature that we talked about in the past is 3d touch so 3d touch has been replaced by haptic touch which is super annoying so if you want a 3d touch let's say TripAdvisor then you have to press and release so that actually opens up something whereas in the past you just long press and it would actually do that but this is kind of like a release thing very annoying three touch could have stayed however we still see 3d touch right over here in the Notes app where you can use your keyboard as a trackpad so this actually still stayed another thing that doesn't work is peek and pop the same way so if you want to look at this you would press on it it loads this peak view here but now you have to actually click on it again so it actually opens up what you want to see whereas in the past you could do it a lot differently another feature that I love is also brightness however it's super deep in the system you have to go to settings accessibility display in text size scroll all the way to the bottom to find auto brightness other brightness I love this thing and also the control center so you know the introduction of the new control center in iOS 12 was super good to see where you could add some controls into the control center however you have to go to the settings control center customize controls but there is nothing new here all of them are the same you cannot really add any third-party apps that could be great you could have like shortcuts over here for like your favorite apps which would be super cool to see but no we don't have that also one thing that everyone's super excited about including myself is the new volume tab so like you know you go but there is this big thing still to this big chunky thing here why didn't they just do this small thin thing right over on this side instead of having this big of a chunk on the side like it's better than the intrusive thing in the middle in the past but still you could have kept the just the skinny one another thing is in the camera so if you go into the camera app you have many different settings in the Settings app for the frame rate and other things like that and other parameters however there's still no button in the actual camera app to go and switch the settings easily but you still have to go through the Settings app very annoying they could have done something similar with the Wi-Fi where you could just press on it and it'll show you a bunch of options right over here but no they just didn't do anything about that well these are the main ones that I found going around on the Internet but of course there's way more and I'd like to know if you agree and disagree with these changes and if they were improved which hopefully they will be then let me know which you agree with and what you don't also let me know which features are also similar to these that are really annoying that could have been better also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown in the right corner but before you click please leave a like and subscribe okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
