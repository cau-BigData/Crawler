hello everyone and welcome back to another video the iPhone rumors are here and there is so many of them we are hearing about five yes five new models next year all of the different counts of cameras we also have a first look at how the iPhone 12 might look and in 2021 there could be an iPhone without any ports before you click away stay as these are so impressive and will bring so much change next year we are expecting five new models and that's the first time we've ever heard this but JP Morgan said that we should be seeing four 5g models next year making all of this sound quite true and believable there will be four four high-end models in September of 2020 and probably an iPhone se too in the iPhone eights case launching in the first or second quarter of 2020 now we're ready for the crazy stuff we are going to have to lower and iPhone 12 models and then to higher and iPhone 12 pro and pro max models respectively they should be five point four and six point two inch models and six point one inch and six one seven inch models respectively let me know what you think about five new models coming in 2020 and whether you think it makes sense for Apple to come out with these let me know in the comments down below all these models will come with 5g chips and the design will maybe reflect the one of the iPhone 4 with the stainless steel bands how might it look been geeking over on Twitter showed us an image of a prototype of the iPhone 12 but it might not be exactly like this so don't get your hopes up just yet there are however a few things I'd like to point out in this prototype the vertical silencer switch which was supposed to come in this year's iPhone but it never did so it might come next year and hopefully it will as that's a nice change since in 2021 we might seeing portlets iPhones Apple might just stick with lightning ports and then just remove it altogether or maybe put USBC on the lower end the models finally there should be no knotch and we have heard about it year after year since the iPhone X but with no change so far as we know Apple has been working so much on their face ID technology and it's pretty apparent now that they can't just remove the knotch jes yet however Bloomberg previously said that we should see an onscreen fingerprint sensor to unlock your device but this is not confirmed by anyone and I don't know if it's true or false now for 2021 as this is really fun Apple is planning to remove all the ports and create a full wireless experience they have a record of removing big things like the headphone jack and so many other things so it might just be coming but it will remove all the ports that is just insane why would they do this there are a few reasons one wireless products are almost everywhere now including wireless headphones wireless keyboards and other accessories like this so that won't be a problem two wireless charging is readily available everywhere and isn't that expensive especially if it even gets faster then it'll be great this will only be on the highest models though so if you still want to keep your ports then you will have to stick with the lower end models previously Johnny I've also wanted a single sheet of glass and a port 'less iPhone obviously it is going in this direction but we'll have to see as it progresses in 2021 Apple is planning to release a plus-sized iPhone se 2 as well which is confirmed by maangchi Co that is a very trusted source there is not much information about this just yet but we will have to wait because it's still two years away well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe as it's all greatly appreciated and also don't forget to my previous video which is going to be shown in the corner up here okay take care and I'll see my next video bye [Music] okay [Music] you [Music]
