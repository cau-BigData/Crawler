good morning guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so today we're going back home that's a sad day not very exciting day we're going back home the airport's right here next to me planes are leaving like crazy ours at 10:05 we made a mistake thinking it was 11:30 but well 10:05 so we're kind of in a rush now we're waiting for the bus to come to take us to the airport and then we go through all the mess in the airport we were here yesterday to drop the car off but now we're here to go home it's kind of sad but Edinburgh Airport we're here we're flying back to Vienna I just kind of said my first issue inside the airport yeah the chicken that's the fun part the whole journey I hate that and I have the security but let's go [Music] check incomplete now we're about to go outside for a last look of Edinburgh from the airport but that's not really nice and then we're going to go through security last looks complete now the goal with this escalator stairs up and [Applause] security over let's continue our road through the airport now security was quite easy this time quite short not many complications and I'm so surprised they did not even check the huge camera buddy that I have on my shoulder that's funny but well sometimes doesn't happen we just walked through the duty-free just a little bit going around just looking around shows because we have like one and a half hour until flight leaves no if I think even less but that's about it the duty-free in Edinburgh is not so big as in many Airport this kind of small doesn't have many places you can go to but it's okay for just looking around now we're just maybe going to sit summer have a drink or something and wait for our plane a small drink over now we're going to go look at the board to see our gauge because they said it should be at 9:17 so we're going to find that it's gate 11 and we're going to go sit and wait for the plane to the plaintiff board shortly here we go boarding the flight finally going back home now London first and and we're going here from London but we have like a three-hour layover right so we arrived to us and Heathrow Airport now you can go to follow connecting flight and a class terminal 3 [Music] [Music] out-of-the-box at Terminal 3 so we're going to follow the flight connection and then security here we go after security we're going to go around the duty-free maybe have some food and stuff we're going to wait because we've a three-hour layover so we need to stay here and just look around [Music] you [Music] sitting in a restaurant we're going to have something to eat before the flight we're going to be stuck here for at least three hours so this is enjoy short lunch over we're going to walk a little bit more through the duty-free stuff we have one and a half hour unto the slide please so actually like more than - yeah - exactly so we're going to still walk around little bit we're going to find a place for dessert and just stay until the slightly because the flight also was moved normally should have been gone already but well so here we go after the duty 3 we're just going to sit here relax a little bit for one and a half hour more until we can go until the plane takes off so we will at 1445 will know the gate number and then we're going to proceed here we go now we know the gate number is gates number nine so we're going to go to the gate located and then go wait 45 more minutes for the place apart but hopefully boarding is short [Music] here we go going now finally PMF on our way boarding [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] like Oh [Music] here we go arrived to be enough finally arrived : I'm not really happy not even excited or anything but we just hope homeless you're home sweet home well not really fun you look great but this is where and if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this and until next time take care and I'll see you in the next [Music]
