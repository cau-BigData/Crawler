hey guys and welcome back to a brand new vlog so probably I have kind of like a morning voice because hold up hold up hold up hold up I have a morning voice because it is 4:40 in the morning it's 4:40 in the morning I just woke up like for the third half an hour ago and I'm already here but we are going to vanish today the taxis here in 20 minutes ago to be in a train station and then we're gonna be in the train for half a day so I'm gonna get some cool shots from that but of course I'm gonna vlog even a little bit after this clip but I want to inform you one thing we all further ado we uh I mean I'm going to vlog three days in a row so it's gonna be kind of like a daily vlogging thing in the vents so this is a test for Scotland and I said without further ado okay so we arrived at the train station I'm so tired that looks feel like a zombie completely it's 5:00 a.m. no it's like 5:30 or 5:45 the Train is he if you look we are back at the train station it's here we need to locate our as it says a to eat the train leaves in half an hour to Venezia Santa Lucia at 625 yes so we need to first locate the train I think is one of these that are on the both sides here but wouldn't you still look and then I'm gonna be back I'm lost again okay so we are in the train now are on our way so seven hours in the Train I think we should arrive around 2 p.m. in Venice and then it's going to become this vlog a little more fun for sure except I think I'm gonna go sleep in the train because I slept for a couple hours last night and I'm so tired [Music] alright so we just arrived to Venice it's like seven hours no last time a block was like six twenty something and now it's he's like two o'clock so that's quite a lot of time just back in that train I slept for most of the ride and now we are going to find our driver I mean the boat driver because I think he should be here somewhere with their name we're gonna find him and then we're gonna go to our hotel one so I'm still we're gonna look her that guy and then we're gonna be on the boat [Music] [Applause] [Music] so basically we just arrived we found our guy he was waiting for us there and now we're just waiting for our both taxi this sounds really sexist it's my first time in Venice honestly and it's gonna be quite a long ride I think throughout the whole city or whatever but it's really nice so far and also I'm surprised that the gondolas are running and it's like December January something like that so that's kind of cool [Music] [Applause] well we are sat in the boat now in the boat backseat it's a really cool it's like a small small boat back there really like it it's gonna be like a 10-minute ride what I heard from from the people but we'll see but it's going to go through the channel and it's it's white [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay guys so we are arriving at their hole not sorry I think we're arriving to our hotel shortly we've been going since 10 minutes like this I hope you enjoyed the shots they were really fun to make and and they are really beautiful and still will be from the hike watch them like two years later but I think we are kind of in the old main hotel area right now we should soon be there in the hotel I'm just gonna show you in the next clip because that's amazing [Music] okay so we just kind of book the whereas reception right now the stock is really nice so far and I'm gonna let you know real quick where we are we are in Bauer Palazzo it's an amazing hotel the rooms going to be ready in like 15 minutes what they said and then we are going to go to the room and it's gonna be I think the room is gonna be amazing but so far we're gonna go to the bar alright so basically now we are going to sit outside for a tiny little bit just to wait for the room that is done I'm making a speed up here and yeah so if you I'm gonna show you look so I'm making a small speed up here so it's going to be very nice where I'm going [Music] okay so just a small drink finished now we waited for more than 10 minutes just to be sure that there will be done but I think they should be done by now we're just gonna go grab the key and and we're going to go to the rooms so that's gonna be fun and I really want to see how it looks okay guys so we arrived at the hotel room everything is in now it looks nice now except it's going to probably become kind of a mess soon where I'm gonna start taking out some of my things and then it's going to become kind of messy a little bit but let me show you around a little bit how nice the room is and I thought it I mean it looks the same on pictures except the pictures were kind of confusing on the Internet [Music] [Music] okay guys so we just finished the small chill-out session in the room we're going down now we're going to try to go walk around now but it's pretty much getting dark so it's gonna be fun and I hope Venice is lit up at night probably it should be right uh and then we're gonna see so I'm taking the stairs right now I don't even know why but we're gonna go outside and see what we can find and where we can go and where I can take you guys so the one worst thing we're staying here for two and a half days so I'm gonna make daily vlogs as I said in the beginning of the video [Music] Oh [Music] we are exploring Venice thoroughly now we just came out of the hotel not so long ago and we stumbled upon these beautiful streets of Venice they're really nice and and what is also amazing that they have this gondola stations all over the place literally almost every step you go you're gonna find a gondola a place where you can catch a boat as you can see here look at this I'm near the water now and this is what they offer always everywhere see servizio gondola so you just take your gondola here and you just go through the channel [Music] so continuing to walk around we stumble upon the plaza of San Marco but it's beautiful I can see but they're rebuilding quite many places here they rebuilt quite many places and many buildings are being redone it's slippery dang it but it's it's a beautiful area and so many people anyways like January but I think it's there's more people during summer [Music] all right so we're moving away from the Sun Marco plugs are right now and we're entering some kind of small street in fact what I did not mention is that we have kind of whoa-ho kind of a small we have kind of a small restaurant that we want to go towards the hotel recommended to us because we don't know anything about anything here but we are going in oh it's small streets as I said to to there but it's quite far away and we did not want to take the water taxi again so we're [Music] okay so we are kind of in a narrow street right now looks nice and I never saw such a I mean I think I saw some narrow streets like this but this really shows you how narrow they are and we've been looking at so many shops now but we've kind of stopped following the directions that we got from the hotel and kind of got lost again but we're gonna get back hopefully using the map we've got salsa and although we're totally unprepared yeah so let's try to find a restaurant I don't even know what time he did but we're gonna find it and walk around so next stop in our journey around Venice is Rialto Bridge so normally we should find some cafe here where we can sit a little bit that it's oh okay there's so many people here and there's a bridge full of people taking pictures so that's quite quite cool and looks nice now we're gonna find a cafe and then there's a restaurant here what we've booked for our hotel booked it for us so that's gonna for let's just go maybe have a summer drink [Music] okay so we found like a very nice small restaurant hidden where almost no tourists are because some local nice guy told us that it's a very nice place to go and it's it opened at 7:00 and is right now like five o'clock only so probably I'll have to we have to wait both of us or all of us are hungry but I'll have to wait we're gonna just go to some kind of cafe as I said just to have a drink and maybe some appetizer or something just to have a little bit time just to spend some time and wait on to the restaurant opens okay guys so we finished up a small stay in the cafe it's six six o'clock now there's 12 hours ago I went into the train at this time but this is six o'clock the dinner here opens at 7:00 only what is quite amazing I understand why because it's kind of like a tavern oh that's that's really for local people and now what we're going to do is through shopping for me so that's gonna be kind of fun the funny thing that I'm going to say in Venice is that you always get lost no matter where you go you get lost now we're trying to find a restaurant back to go eat because they open in half an hour and then we're gonna eat okay guys so one mission accomplished well my new shoes I'm gonna show you now where whoa nice they're nice they're nice they're nice one thing accomplished now time to go to the restaurant are we going even the right way oh there's a mirror Oh what what we are somewhere in some kind of hallway it's so dark everywhere well introduce cameras doing a gigantic great work of lighting it up so perfect in fact we came back to the same street I think honestly but let's find the restaurants we want to have pasta for dinner since its surrounds every now and then we're gonna head back to the hotel [Music] okay so we just finished in the restaurant trattoria a la mulana sounds like a great name you just finished over there and now we're about to go back to the hotel except for like the sixth third billionth time today we are lost so we're following some signs that lead us somewhere not even because we even lost the signs now but we're gonna try to get to the hotel and then I will go to edit so I hope you enjoyed this daily vlog I'm not ending it here I'm gonna end it at the hotel but tomorrow we're gonna do another daily vlog so
