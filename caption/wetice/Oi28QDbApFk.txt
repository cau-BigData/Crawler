hello guys welcome back to another video today we've got some exciting news about iOS 13 there have been some leaks some rumors some speculation about all of this but let me talk about some of all these things in this video anyway I was 13 will be the new generation of iOS which will come out this year sometime yeah we don't know that's the thing but we're gonna see a beta sometime in june/july something like that as every year but there's a lot of evidence showing that iOS 13 will be a massive update with new features a newer design and is not gonna be just focused on the performance iOS 12 has been focused on a lot of the performance side of iOS and it's fix a lot of bugs and many people are happy with it including me because iOS 11 was just a little bit too unstable and I was 12 just smashed all the bugs broad group FaceTime which is a great feature but didn't bring much else to the iOS except a lot of fixes now let's talk about some new iOS 13 features so there should be a cross-platform app kind of thingy and this was originally announced in WWDC 2018 so this is supposed to come in 2019 and it may come in one of the iOS 12 updates like iOS 12.3 or something like that we're gonna see all about that it's unsure I believe that it's gonna come out in iOS 13 as kind of a great feature the biggest thing that we see leaks about and most rumors about I said we should have a huge debt and take sure a design of the UI and it should be more 3d maybe some new anime Shen's maybe some new things like that but that's all just speculation because we're just really far away from my OS 13 now all this can change this is just speculation but it's supposed to be one of the biggest iOS updates since a long time let's put it that way but I always needs to be refresh it's been like this for a very very long time it's just a flat design that's been here for too long and we just need a fresh one new features really brand new features a brand new UI I hope it doesn't look like an Android UI because that would be just but we just need a new UI that's the whole thing I'm really excited for that because that will just change how iOS looks completely and hopefully new features to talk about it because iOS 12 has just been a lot of bugs a lot of lawsuits yeah a lot of crap like that no really new big features but anyway a lot of speculation all of this may change all of this may not even be true but it's just exciting to share this with you cuz I just love talking about I was an apple and all that stuff but anyway if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below you'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video with hopefully some new iOS stuff hopefully even new i always 12 put something it would be great anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
