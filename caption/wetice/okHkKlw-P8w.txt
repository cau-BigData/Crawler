hello guys welcome back to another video today I had to even put my camera's up and just like this box is massive and today what we're unboxing is we're unboxing DJI Ronin S this is a super good stabilizer for a DSLR camera which I don't know the specs really about it but there's gonna be a review and a bunch of other videos about this because I'm super excited to test this amazing thing out so it's just gonna do the unboxing which is the point of this video I don't really know how to open this thing but oh wow okay it it doesn't has a hard case and everything Wow okay don't care about that okay this is seriously very confusing or is it just me how do you open this thing oh I was locking it instead of unlocking it okay here it is here is the entire box Wow I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna really put it together right now because there's a thousand pieces but let's just take like a basic look I don't even know how to take this thing out screws and stuff this is really good at using what is this this is the battery so battery that's simple but how do you take this thing out that's what I wanna know and I don't know how to take it out okay this is really stirred I'm really gonna be surprised how this thing works [Music] this is very interesting I believe the camera goes here at least that's the only thing it kind of makes sense I have no idea wow I have no idea really just put it back in the box and I'll have to look into this because it's really impressive and I don't know how it works and what is this this is so cool this thing is like the best thing from taking time lapses and stuff this is really amazing but I tell you what guys I'm gonna like try to go figure this thing out and put it together and then I will show it to you and showcase a little bit this alright so give me like seven hours well here I am back with the DJI okay it's very heavy here I'm back with the DJI stabilizer so here it is mounted all together and fully functional so actually after some testing with this thing it's really stable like very stable but that's gonna be in another video so I just wanted to show this that it's basically this so if you mount it all together from the box it's gonna look something like this the stabilization process for the camera is kind of painful but if you go through it then you'll figure out how it works and I'll be more than happy to make a video about that if you would like that so let me know about that by leaving a like and a comment and if you want to see more videos about this thing then also leave a like and a comment and I will get back to it but anyway this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time bye [Music] you
