hello everyone and welcome back to another video today Apple released iOS 13 point for beta 3 just one week after beta 2 alongside these we got the updates for iPad OS watch OS and TV OS as well as Mac OS we are going to take a look at the new features and changes as well as the performance and battery life on beta 2 and beta 3 the public beta should be getting the update soon if it isn't already released at the time of this video so the update size is about 336 megabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max it was a little smaller on iPad OS on my iPad pro at about 280 megabytes of course this will vary depending on which device you have and from which software version you're coming from so let's head over into settings and go into general About section and hit this and we can see it we're running 17 5 2 4 1 D the D at the end means and we are coming closer to the final release of 13.4 but we should still expect one or two more betas before so if we head over a little lower we can see that the modem firmware went from 1.0 5.25 to 1.0 v dot 28 so if you had any connectivity issues this should of course help with that and should make the experience much better so let's start with the new changes in this beta so if we head over into the photos app you can see that we can now slide down here instead of tapping in the past so that's a little change but it's nice to see if you have the air Potts Pro and we head over into settings and we go into bluetooth and we have the air Potts Pro if we see this and they're connected you would have more options right there so for those that use the TV app if you head over down here to the TV app settings you can see that there are some new settings for you to tweak to see what you can do now there's also additional information for car key which is an additional to probably come in 13.4 that allows you to unlock your car with your phone if it supports NFC so you can share the key with someone which can then access the car but otherwise there are not any details about the sharing but we could be seeing this in the final release of 13.4 the mail app seems to be quite good now I didn't have any issues from the beginning of 13.4 compared to thirteen point three point one but I heard some people still reporting some issues so if you've been having anything please let me know in the comments down below but for now it's doing great on my phone another big bug on my iPhone was in the Notification Center where the notifications didn't group correctly but now that seems to be fixed as I've hadn't had the issue on this phone yet and I've gotten some notifications I didn't experience this bug in beta 2 but some people said that they still had it in beta 2 so I would say that it should be fixed in beta 3 now also the Instagram bug is still present so this bug basically what it does is that when you play video with audio on Instagram then you go out of the app and audio would still continue playing even if you went to another app so this issue I've had this issue for a couple of betas now it's still here I can say I tested it out on beta 3 and this one it is still here so hopefully Apple will be able to fix it soon I also heard that some people reported some issues on carplay that basically the phone wouldn't ring either on your Apple watch or in the car so I didn't test this out but if it's happening to you like you know in the comments down below and also let me know after you update to this beta if it's fixed the text message notification bug is still present where you don't get any notifications when you get a text message you don't get it on your home screen you don't get a banner there's no sound there's no vibration there is nothing so I hopefully they will fix this very soon because it's becoming quite annoying now what about the performance and battery life so performance is very good on my iPhone 11 pro max I didn't notice any significant difference except there is this one issue when we go to settings and we go to general and the About section watch how it's going to stutter for a little bit so I click the about it stays there and then it opens up so did you notice how slow it opens up so of course this is probably going to be even slower on older devices but it's quite annoying so in this regard the performance might be a little worse but nothing significant the battery life is very good and was very good on beta 2 I have no problems the phone last pretty much the whole day especially over the recent days that my usage is not very high but it's lasting a long time and I have absolutely no problem with the battery life but of course the battery health on this phone is still at a hundred percent so it's excellent now should you update to thirteen point four beta three if you are on beta 2 then you should definitely upgrade to beta 3 for some additional bug fixes and some stability improvements as when we get further into the betas the stability will be much better but if you're on a public release of full release like thirteen point three point one then I would say that even if it's buggy ages wait maybe one more beta until beta four and then update as the beta will be more stable later on so that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed then please do leave a like and subscribe as it helps me out tremendously also don't forget to watch my previous video in the corner up there okay take care and I'll see you in the next video [Music] you
