should not go we need to go to gate big this is overexposed Jesus let's go to gate D and then it's go through security and we're off to one okay so we just finished waiting in a small cafe we had some kind of drink and stuff and now they're going through security and we're going to go wait at the gates because the flight leaves in a 50 minutes so yeah let's go London that's like two hours from here and then we need to go to Edinburgh so we'll have to wait at the airport on our way to the plane Solar so we're boarding time to go to London I'm so excited let's go it's gonna be fun Scotland we're coming [Music] [Music] ok so we arrived to London Heathrow Airport and now we just need to go some kind of connection place to connect to our next flight and then we should be good then we have like two hours to wait but thats cool thing ok so we were dropped off at terminal 5 by a battle now they said we should follow the flight connections all terminals report sign so that's what we're going to do and you'll see where we are going to get by doing that now where you find their flight our terminal and ml kinda just went through security now walking around the duty-free stuff just looking around what you can see and then they're going to tell us the gate shortly like in maybe half an hour and then we will know where to go all right now we just give passport check and all of that and we're going now following we're going to security we found out its terminal we don't know what yet we just need to follow and then we should arrive somewhere ok just walking down we just had food and we're going to go walk around then we look at some electronic source what I love doing and then we're going to go sit and find you know Ezra we have our plane but if they're going to announce that in 10 minutes so we have skill sometimes ok so we found out what our gate number is it's a seven so we need to now proceed to the gate now we don't know which way to go anyway so we're again dumb and we're going to try to locate it yeah that's going to be fun boarding the plane route to Scotland Edinburgh let's go the plane is here let's go to Scotland I'm so excited and flopping in Edinburgh yay [Music] Leroy night [Music] alright and just like that arrived to Scotland here ago I'm so excited here to finally here after like an hour it's not right you look so long it was ok but now time to find our company anyway before we get the car we need to get our luggage that the priority and then we're going to get the car show [Music] well now we're walking around car rental center so that's kind of complicated but we're walking through a tunnel so we should get there in following time hopefully okay so we just came and got the car enterprises the rental company very good obviously it's nice its power is time dependent reverse on goes on so far here it's amazing we're trying to make it work otherwise is a good [Music] okay so we just arrived to the hotel we arrived with the car here I can tell you that the car was so much fun and so much straight because you know in Austria you drive in in the opposite direction then here so we have to be concentrating on that so that was fun so now we're going to the hotel we're going to check in we're going to leave our back and we're going to go see our next location for this blog ok so we are in the hotel now we are going to have a drink and then we are going to go explore to the grassmarket as I said except we're quite thirsty so that's the only thing we're going to do for now and then we're going to go ok out of the restaurant and now we are walking down the street so we're going to get lost and we're going to go visit the grassmarket as I said then we're going to go to go to the castle and also from the hotel that suggested to go see a hill but I don't think if we're going to manage to do that all in one day so maybe not but we'll try to look at some some of them [Music] by the way fun fact because a map and realized it at the hotels and such as a fun fact so hopefully we remember where the hotel is wonder why it maybe looks complicated to get back to the hotel but you know what we get lost and we get unlost [Applause] I [Applause] [Music] so we're going to the castle we're going to find their work right next to cute and well we're going to I [Music] ok well the castle we saw that that we saw from was nice you now we're going to see the church or cathedral and how to name it good question but that's going to be fun to design excellence it looks quite nice in old so maybe I can get some nice shots from that and then go see where the road seconds we're by now we're lost [Music] [Music] somehow we ended up at the castle again so I i found that it's called the north wind castle I saw sign like that but I know it looks nice we're not going to go inside not really kissing that much but we're going to look at the view from up here where we walked off [Music] after a great dinner time to go back to the hotel I'm extremely tired now after the whole basis we've been traveling all of the airport and stuff is it's really tiring and even walking around that inverse retreating tires and looking around it's
