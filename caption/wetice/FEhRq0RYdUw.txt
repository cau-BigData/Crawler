what's up guys Apple release the GM of iOS 13.5 - the registered developers and the public will be getting it this week also Apple released watch our six point two point five to the public so if you're interested in that stay until the end of the video so in this video we're going to take a look at what's new the performance and battery life as well as the bugs that we have in thirteen point five so starting with the update size we can see that it is about four point one six gigabytes on my iPhone 11 pro max of course this will vary depending on which device you have and from which software version you are coming from if we head over into settings and general the About section click here we can see we're running 17 f75 which is the build number here and there's no letter at the end meaning this is the update that the public will be getting really really soon if we had a little lower we can see that the modem firmware is unchanged again it remains at 1.0 6.00 which has been like this since beta one or two of thirteen point five therefore don't expect any major improvements to connectivity at all so in this video I'm going to talk about the changes coming from beta four but as soon as this update is released to everyone later this week I'll make a more in-depth video with all the new features that are in here so stay tuned for that one so regarding the changes there is a new kovat 19 exposure menu so if you go to privacy health you can see up here this has been updated a little bit so basically there's a description under which says when enabled iPhone can exchange random IDs with other devices using bluetooth this enables an app to notify you if you may have been exposed to covert 19 exposure login cannot access any data in or add any data to the health app so this really clearly explains what it is there's of course more information when you click on it of course it depends on which region you are because some regions are not supported just yet now regarding another feature which is the face ID feature which allows you to get into your phone with a mass so usually it will try to verify your face but since your face is covered with the mask it will have a problem using face ID now face ID detects that you have a mask and to directly go into the passcode menu so this new feature worked very well with me on the previous beta so there shouldn't be any major differences here and you should have it as soon as this week now regarding the bugs I saw many bugs going around and I didn't experience these but let's get into them either way there is a new share screen bug where basically if you go here and you want to share something it would basically not open that menu and it would be blank so this one was apparently fixed here in 13.5 but I didn't have this bug before so I'm not sure if it's still here or not now there are still issues in the mail app for many people there is still the bug which shows you a badge at the emails like this for example and when you go into the app it doesn't show you any new emails and you just have to go refresh it to actually get those emails further some people also saw duplicate emails which is something I don't really understand and never had so probably there is no fix here in thirteen point five for these issues you'll probably have to wait for them to be fixed in iOS 14 now there are also some problems with connectivity on the iPhone so I didn't have these but I heard many people were having them since I didn't have them I don't know if they are fixed here or not but if you had these issues and they're fixed please let me know in the comments down below now regarding the performance and battery life so performance seems to be good there's no significant difference going from beta 4 in Geekbench there are little differences but nothing that will affect your day-to-day usage on your device however going from thirteen point four point one you will definitely see an improvement in performance now regarding battery life battery life is also very good for me but my battery health is still at a hundred percent so it of course will depend on the battery health how you use your phone how long you use your phone and if you use like Hardware intensive apps then maybe your battery life will be lower but I didn't have any significant changes so it should be good and especially going from thirteen point four point one you will not notice any significant difference now regarding watch OS six point two point five that was just released to the public so you haven't you new watch races and Saudi Arabia is also going to be getting the ECG and irregular heart notifications and there are also some stability improvements all across as well as some bug fixes and you might also notice a little increase in battery life so we got Iowa's thirteen point five and watch OS six point two point five now should you update well I would say yes go ahead and update this is of course a GM build so it's something that everyone is going to be getting and for me a thirteen point five has been a good experience there have not been many changes so don't expect any big bugs or new bugs all across there's just a new covert related features as well as the face ID unlocking is easier so that's pretty much that but if you're a developer on the GM bill now like I am here then you will not be updating anymore since you're already on the GM build however if you're on thirteen point four point one or in the public beta is anywhere beneath then you will get the update later
