hello everyone and welcome back to another video air pods are becoming a big part of our lives and over the recent year they have blown up today we are going to look at what the future holds for the air pods three there have been many talks about the removal of the basic air pods because of how well the air buds Pro are doing however that's definitely not going to happen so don't worry Apple always has two products a basic one and a pro version so they're going to keep that in order to differentiate in what you get and how much you pay for it maangchi co said last year that Apple is working on air plus three so since he has an extremely good track record they will be coming what about the changes the biggest change by far is going to be the all new black color the air pods they will have for the past two releases there have always been talks about different colors if you look back and when the airports to where at least there was a rumored black color but it didn't come with the air Potts Pro there should be a new midnight green color but yet it didn't come however after all this we might be seeing the new black color this year we might be also getting the mate finish that can currently be seen on the iPhone 11 Pro Series this is also rumored to come on the air pods last year but it didn't so could this be this year maybe maybe not regarding the internal specs we have no news whatsoever we are hearing about health features coming to the airports 3 which could measure your heart rate this would definitely attract many users that don't have an Apple watch and want to track their heart health you would basically just put them in go workout and after it would directly put the information into the health app this could really save lives especially if it finds some irregularities with your heart we have been seeing more and more health features across most of Apple's new products for example this year we got hearing health and ECG both these features really helped market these products as important for your health so we might be seeing health features but we really don't know how many and to what extent for example the Apple watch Series six might be getting a non-invasive glucose monitoring sensor so you can really see that Apple's focus is health in the recent years we might be also getting upgraded sound quality maybe more bass and other features since it wasn't updated from the first version to the second version of the air pods water resistance is also being rumored to be getting better or at least similar to the airport's probe I don't think you will be able to fully submerge them but they will be more sweat and dust resistant what about battery life I personally consider the battery life to be quite good but I'm not a very heavy users I use them only when I go work out every cup every day or every two days so the battery life is quite long however many heavy users would benefit more from it so could it be coming we'll have to wait and see we know that they are coming but the release date is still unclear if you enjoyed this video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when my new video comes up also if you would like to check out my previous video then please click the card shown up here ok take care and I'll see my new video [Music] you
