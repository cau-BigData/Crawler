hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we received a new report about the 2019 iPhones this report brings some interesting news that we never ever heard before we should be seeing five iPhones this year yes five iPhones what could this mean for the future of Apple but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more we got a new report from Mac Takara which has been wrong only a few times in the past so I would consider this source trustworthy they say that Apple will introduce five new iPhone models in 2019 what they basically mean is that there should be three new versions of the 2019 models and two high end models the brand new iPhones should have a 6.1 inch and 6.5 inch OLED screens these would basically act as higher-end models over the X s and X R series however no one else said this which brings questions whether or not this is actually true now I would love to hear what you think about this and whether or not it could be happening in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more let's take a closer look you might be asking why would Apple do this well the simple answer here is that they want to offer phones at a cheaper price so they are more accessible to many more people Apple will most likely not increased prices again this year as 2018 iPhones wear and a giant success the 2018 iPhones could be simply updated with a better processor and a better camera but stay mostly the same the two new premium models would be at a higher cost to the triple camera setup and more also as we saw previously prototype one was pretty much chosen for the Twain I phoned in the past we heard that the iPhone batteries are getting bigger into a 19 and now Mac Takara says that the iPhones will be getting a little thicker the 6.1 inch OLED model should be 0.15 millimetres thicker however the camera bump will be 0.5 millimeters thinner the 6.5 inch OLED model should be zero point four millimeters thicker however the camera bump well be 0.25 millimeters thinner this really confirms that Mac Takara has some details that make this report more reliable the highest level of iPhones will also support bilateral charging which means that you can place your ear pods or your Apple watch and it will charge since the batteries would be getting bigger we could be seeing the 18 watt USB C 2 lightning 4 charger which would allow for fast charging so these specifications don't sound that bad right yeah except the prototype that was chosen for the 2019 highest level iPhone also let's hope that the notch will be gone this year we also got some information from on leaks over on Twitter saying that the iPhone 11 and 11 max could both have the triple camera not only one of the models this pretty much confirmed some things that Mac takara said today this means that sources agree which is great great news well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about this iPhone and whether or not you'd get it in the comment down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
