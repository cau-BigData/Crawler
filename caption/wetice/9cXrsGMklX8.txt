welcome back to another video how are you today I think it's a good day again because today I'm unboxing the other thing that came the other day that just makes a lot of sense today we're unboxing this is what I've been waiting for so time to unbox this well this is it is the canon EF 16 to 35 millimeters x 4 this lens is an amazing one now recently we unboxed the canon 6d this lens was unboxed kind of prior because I had to try this camera out but today this would be like a real unboxing to see what's inside so let's open the box you come out first your sieve this small packet where you can put the lens what I find and really amazing thing this is really practical when you travel one thing now and now we come the ledge so get out here is the lens and this is the Sun cap thing Thanks and that's it now let's concentrate on this lens this is the lens that we're talking about the 60 and 35 millimeters lens if you remove it one thing that I noticed immediately while using it is that you know you're looking in zooming out it just changes inside just watch it see can you kind of see because it's the eye you see I am as you can see it kind of goes like that it's not like a classical lens that does this hold up a classical lens that basically you know goes like that right that's not what we having this one does everything inside now of course you have your auto focus and stabilization buttons here so that's great and before you get it be sure to look of what kind of camera you're buying cuz this is a full frame lens which means yeah you can put it on a non full frame camera but it's not gonna perform the same way as you're gonna see performing in a minute so yeah this lens this one here is not the full frame okay that's why and the way you can identify that is by having this little white dot here okay that means it's not full frame and here you have a red dot which means that it's full-frame so some of these also have a white square and a red dot which means they're compatible with both I think I have one lens like that I don't know where Wow and I never mind so be careful about that this one's great aperture wise it's a four it's not the best but it's good for daylight low light anyway now let's see this camera with this lens in action there you go this is the camera with the lens as you can see here and here we go canon 60 mark ii with 16 to 35 millimeter lens Wow Wow I'm sick I'm that's kind of horrible now sounding but let's I have the g7x here let's just turn it on to start recording this is now on the g7x it's great footage is great I love the g7x now here I'm talking to the 60 mark - with this amazing lens so yeah difference right there's a big difference so yeah this is the new camera that I'll be using all the time now I'm for pretty much everything so if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it would be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video bye Oh
