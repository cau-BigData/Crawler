hello everyone and welcome back to another video this is the third take on this video because always something broke but anyway today we're going to go look at some of my old videos I did this video in the past I love doing these so I just thought we would just go and look at it so here we go so I opened up my folder right over here and I'm in 2016 currently and I would just want to go look at the videos so here are my videos loading up I feel like we're gonna watch 2016 December beginning of December I just have a stupid face here that's why we're gonna watch this one welcome back to a new vlog so today is a Saturday and I decided since it's like December already that you're going to go get the Christmas tree not a fake one everyone we are on our way now to get the tree and then we're gonna decorate my room and also the Christmas tree so that's gonna be fun ok ok my voice was completely different but that's probably kind of normal anyway I just felt so awkward like me and the video staring away look at this it's just like what I what am I doing here anyway oh and okay me I'm pulling out the Christmas tree wait so much music okay why is it so loud though you know in the past did you see that like look at this me trying to tell cut me carrying a Christmas tree also on my macbook speakers under the lowest volume possible and it's still loudest stuff [Music] okay this video is kind of stupid let's go take a look at some other videos and now oh my god yes the video where I was about there not being any power I don't know where the video is but I think it's this one isn't this one yes it's this one number 15 so we're this ugly mess here and I want to have a proper nice setup that is working okay this is me doing my setup for the 500th time why is this he why is this computer heating up me anyway where's the video arrows bitching about having no power yo guys oh that was the time when I was making 17 minutes for logs because I was lazy as to edit that's me and the intro was like two and a half minute and so you pretty much go from an intro to the train station also Jesus Christ I lost weight is that only me no probably everyone okay what's going on here okay so we are outside there's speed out where's the speed up also he loved my hair back then no I love my hair now also I changed my hairstyle sidenote anyway I was kinda obsessed with speed ups back then I don't get it don't you call them time lapses yeah okay I have enough of this video I totally remove the stupid screen over anyway remember the time when I had a 100 d and tried shooting a video into dark I found it so cool to have like LED lights can kind of like purple lights and stuff that I just literally try to shoot a video with the lens that it was like six like aperture six which is like totally not low light I should have used my iPhone who have been better like even this lens what is this lens 5 well that's not better or at least just use the lights that you have behind you it's not difficult me trying to be artistic I was reading comments and I was literally reading them to myself I was not even showing them on the screen let's continue down the road in these videos also this video I never got this video me showing off my ugly ass bed my ugly ass carpet my ugly ugly ugly ass floor it sounds really fat what the me again looking at bubble wrap cuz that's what you do oh my god I was literally doing an unboxing are you kidding me but like and then oh my god I still have this tripod oh no I don't I broke it oh ok this was an unboxing of me opening network switches tripods a gorilla pod and about how the closure is oh and also if you don't hear the audio is because I cannot figure out how to make my mac record audio through OBS if you have and if you have knowledge about how to record audio with OBS let me know in the comments because it's pissing me off anyway let's continue let's go to 2017 and I don't want this video let's go to 2017 videos this is where I actually started making videos almost every day I wasn't I'm making oh my god no like making videos every month more stable e than like a vlog here and there and playing Minecraft apparently you say minecraft now anyway let's go all the way to January because I think we were in Venice totally oh my god the Italian guy presentation oh my god this is hilarious oh so why was my English so weird like try to listen to this like a week ago or something as I said in one of my vlog that we went to visit kind of like a shop there was a guy who made the kneading masa and goes why does my English sound so stupid it still stones stones I I cannot speak it still sounds it still sounds stupid but less stupid than before oh my god yeah the guy was so embarrassed just look at he was so embarrassed I felt bad and I totally I told him to speak English by the way and he was like kid I'm gonna speak Italian and French at the same time because just cuz even weren't were that where do they speak French in Venice I'm having more fun than you're probably having oh let's look at my recording setup oh my god yes where's the actual fight you know the time when I was calling my videos of log mp4 I love that now I actually organized them by date what is my face I'll remember that intro welcome to a brand new video yeah what has happening to my face oh boy okay this sounded so boring me making a new recording setup that you're probably gonna see I don't even know when this video was posted because like apparently I'm pre-recording and so like when's the schedule for this way let's go see Microsoft Excel I had to restart my computer oh my god let's look at this when is this video do so reacting to my old videos 23rd of July today's 23rd of July but it's June 18 and I'm making a setup
