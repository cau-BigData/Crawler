welcome back to another video I did not record videos for the past month or so welcome back I am in France right now and as you know based on the title of the video I'm gonna talk about why I love sailing so sailing is my hobby and I love it and I've been sailing for the past five years so it's really really it's a it's a long time actually we've been on a sailing trip one to two weeks ago we're gonna see that after this video comes out or maybe not sir I don't even know when this video gonna come out but why I love sailing that's the topic well enjoy this beautiful background here I hope it's not too noisy but why I love sailing so it depends on the type of ship of course or the type of boat if you're talking about a sail boat that's 35 to 40 feet which is a really large sail boat then yes I love it because you can go places that you cannot normally see when you're on land or driving around or whatever else like that so you get to see everything from a different perspective whereas before when you're traveling by car visiting like a beach for example you just see the sea and you don't really see the beach whereas from the boat you can really see the the beach itself and and the beauty of the land so that's pretty much one of the main reasons why I love sailing on big sailboats but now let's take for example Hobie Cat 16 for example it's just I'm sailing catamaran so it's a thrill just with about 10 knots of wind you can go out to be the 15 to 20 knots which is really impressive and that's the thrill of the speed now it's not anymore the it's not anymore Beach it's the thrill of its adrenalin let's say that's what you're going really fast you're going like this it's just it's a very indescribable you cannot really describe the feeling you have to really feel it but that's what I'm doing here in France for the next 40 days or I was I'm confused when this video will go up or whatever but just 40 days of pure fun sailing on a sports catamaran so it's I don't even know how to describe the feeling is just like you're going with the speed you feel the wind and and you're alone on the sea there are not really many rules there's no government well there are rules of course but you're you feel to be free and not you just like excluded out of the world you're just in your own world on your own boat which makes the really great and different feeling then previous feeling someone's talking so yeah that's pretty much like that's why I love sailing is the thrill and the discovery of new places and see places from a different perspective and enjoy earth that just sounds too positive the reason I why I'm wearing glasses is because I have a white marks from glasses so I think I'll be wearing glasses for the next few videos but anyway this is just I want to share this with you as a short video while I love sailing it's all about feelings and discovery so anyway if you enjoy this video you should leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and in the comment section tell me if you enjoy these kind of videos where I talk about something and not necessarily do something so yeah ok thank you see you next time bye [Music]
