[Music] time to install the power supply so as you can see we're installing the power supply and we're just going to put the screws to attach it that it doesn't fall out so every screw it in we don't want this power supply to fall out of the case of course so that's why we just need to basically screw it now it's time to take the cpu cooler and just unreal remove the plastic unwrap it and start setting it up and see how it looks I think it looks quite nice right I think it's quite cuts Christmas now probably this is the most annoying part out of all kind of putting the CPU radiators up there and attach it that's going to be kind of difficult but yeah I think we're going to manage that like [Applause] [Music] [Music] now probably one of the harder for parts comes right here we just have to take the small cpu and kind of put it into the installation kind of kit that comes with it to put it in its spot on the motherboard so it was kind of a pain in the bus to do this but I think we we handled it quite well well the damn CPU is in place finally we struggled with it quite a little bit to put it in place it kind of opened up and then slammed in everything all over the place but it's there now time to turn the overclocking on that's that little switch what was disappointed if we turn it on the overclocking will be activated and now there's the one more such that we need to support but my friend means the little bit of help so I had to cut the camera right here [Applause] now [Music] now normally each match in each manual you're going to find how to put the ram in which spot so we found out that it could be in these spots in the gray ones and so on the black and that's where you usually gonna have it in your manual dependence how much RAM you want to put how many memory sticks you have time to put the cpu cooler fans for the radiator for the CPU and we're going to put both of them you just need to screw them on top let's vary found the ideal place for them you can even put them on bottom if you really want to [Music] [Music] time to install the screws on the holes that you have on the CPU where the cooler will be the pump basically will be installed now as you can see we have the pump that's going to be installed on top of the schools we just play shortly and it's kind of a struggle to put it there but it's just an easy screwing again with the small knob that you get you can screw it on top and then it holds in place and you do that four times on all of the side [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] now I recommend finding the correct power cable that goes where because otherwise it may not work as you expected it to work so yeah try to find the correct cable sometimes there is written on the cable for what it is and just kind of help yourself to the manual power on so now the computer should start as you can see it's going to start flashing kind of blue that's kind of the briefing effects of the motherboard from asus and now normally we should sometimes probably get a code or something that this is working or not the orchid Craster's is the whole house burns down hooray we got a cold I don't know is that good sign or not sometimes the good sign sometimes it's not but this code meant that basically we put the ram in the wrong way and basically it was bad and everything went bad yeah the round could not start [Music] you time to install the graphics card into the motherboard and just lock it in place and put the power to it and everything and then turn the computer on and see the screen show there's something but some motherboards have the option that they have already some kind of small crappy graphics card but this ace is x99 a 2 or something like that did not have that option so we had to put a graphics card to see what was happening [Music] [Applause] [Applause] the bios loaded that's always a great sign that you have made some progress and that your computer is working so now only time to just install windows in silence setting time to install also the SSD so it goes on this kind of small plate to the back of the case and you just have to put the SSD and kind of screw it on that metallic plate or something [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] windows is installing on this computer it's currently restarting and reflecting an English version because we bought it in Austria and dining they put it in German so we had to take an English version and put it on the computer so that this is doing right now right Oh [Music] [Music] time to put the hard drive so there's kind of slots for it we just have to kind of push it in to have it in place and then it should just smack into place and it's going to hold it's not going to move and now the only thing we need to do is put the cables that all go to be plugged into the hard drive [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music]
