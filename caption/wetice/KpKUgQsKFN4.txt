hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today is another day and another video so today the topic of the video will be quite simple now one week ago I got the iPhone 7 plus and I want to share some feelings about it with you now the first thing was as some of you may know before added the iPhone 5s and the first noticeable big change for me and what kind of aggressive was the size of course so my iPhone 5 was like I don't have the iPhone 5 anymore but I have a case it was this size and now go here now the iPhone 7 plus is with this size so noticeable change actually that's kind of funny right now if I put it like this let's I don't see anything now so as you can see there's a big difference now this was really really great for me in one way and bad in the other first of all it was kind of big for at the beginning I was like oh well open the box then it was huge at first the box the box is huge the box says you sort I don't even have the item file box anymore but the box is huge so I was like oh wow this this phone's massive then you open the box the box is kind of a bigger than the phone of course and it was bigger and and when I compared it to the phone that I had that day still it was a big difference it was not even the size of the screen and I'm not even talking about the borders so that was amazing now one other thing that also changed and completely messed me up was that it's directing with the iPhone 6 the button was put on the side over here what confused me because it was not on the top anymore like it was before so that was a noticeable change and whenever I went to like push the phone up like shut it off I was like why you no work so they had to put it on the side and then it works so that was kind of an interesting thing that I had to learn after a while and now I have it for a week so I'm kind of used to it now now another noticeable change is I found on it and I think it's only the ISIL scent that has it I never had the iPhone 6 the button is not like possible anymore that before you to manually mechanically push it in for it to like you know open the phone but now it's kind of just like a vibration it when you shut the phone off you cannot push the button that was like a big big change what's really like surprised me since I was used to like really pushing the button so let's take enough like fall in and break I hope so that's kind of good thing about that then another thing that I found out to this is that I see better I see everything a lot better it's a lot easier to work on it than on a small device you can do many more things with it on a larger scale that you're going to be on such a small device I'm not saying that the iPhone 5 is bad but it's a noticeable difference with a lot of things inside now the one thing that I love the most and it's my favorite about it is that the camera here is my favorite thing ever because it takes wonderful pictures now if you want to check out some more pictures from this phone then you should go check out my Instagram it will be right here on the screen and just check it out there's a link in the description so you can go check that out and there will be from the iPhone 7 there it makes this picture with such a depth effect that it's amazing I love it there's a big difference from the pictures from the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 7 there is this option in the camera like you know if you open the camera thing then you can choose between portrait and the portrait you need to displace a subject 8 feet so it makes scared of depth and thing and it's really really excellent now the next thing that I really like you have a slow motion of course the time I think have a speed I don't even know what I have in okay you have the time lapse you have the slow motion you have the normal photo you're the square you have the portrait and you have the birds she has the panorama and the video so that's great you can do many many things with this camera in the phone and I really like the camera because you can really do you need to carry a DSLR like of course a DSLR takes but your picture but when you're just somewhere quickly you want to get a shot perfect I would recommend this like no carries with you you can take amazing pictures whenever you want to so that's excellent now this one feature that I really really like is that if the phone is stale as you can see right now it's off and then whenever you pick it up you do like laying on the table or something to pick it up quickly you see if it starts by oh it starts by movement so if you move it so you know it's stable like this on a on a table and if you pick it up it turns on so that's an amazing thing now I like it and I don't like it again because something's give me annoying if you're carrying your phone in your hand then it keeps turning on and off and on and off so that's kind of bad but in but on the other side it can be great when it's on a table you don't have to push the button always it always starts for you kind of and you can just access and also with the home button if I go back the touch ID is extremely fast working so we literally just have to click on it then it will open your phone before my eyes when I click before on the iPhone 5 I had to like you know put my some multiple times to open it so that was not really the betray'd thing about that but now this one I just push that's why I even I can't even push the stuff if I always just see what song is playing for example because it's so quick that it registers my thumb and it opens the phone so that's in another hand also kind of annoying but in another hand it's quite good because you can open your phone quickly and then I have to use another finger that's not registered to open like to see what song's playing or the notifications because then it just open so that's good and bad like everything what else should I say I think that's it for this phone so far what I found out in one week it has an excellent display with a great resolution what I really really like about that and I think I never tried making videos yet but of course I'll try to do one day and maybe make a vlog of the iPhone 7 that can be an interesting idea for a video but this will wrap it up I have nothing else to say I don't think so maybe I'll make like an in this version of this later on when I figure some more when I figure more things out about it but until next time take care and I'll see you in the next video so please subscribe and leave a like greatly appreciated it's over this phone is amazing stay safe with a cover that [Music]
