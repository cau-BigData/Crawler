hello guys welcome back to another video today we have another unboxing video many of you requested another in boxing in the previous video here we are today unboxing something that I'll pretty much use in all of my other videos what we have here on the table is a teleprompter for all my future videos so it's in this tiny box which I'm kind of surprised how can I be in such a tiny box um let's just get into it so there's pretty much a simple unboxing most likely just there was a no is open is alright well okay well we are in it's completely open now there's there's an instruction manual okay that's how to put the Play camera on and stuff cool manual probably not gonna understand anything but we're gonna try but that's not gonna be in this video because here we're unboxing and this is useless then we have another manual what oh that bag comes with it oh my god that's gonna be oh okay here we go we have the first okay there's a lot of its gonna take me like five hours to mount and I need to record another video tonight so let's just open this up what do we have okay that's the glove oh they even provide like a cleaner that's cool okay here's the glass you probably have to clean it it's disgusting but that's the glass let's close this back up actually okay never gonna close it back again anyway let's put it on the side look at all of this crap that we have here jeez so we've got some some screws for who knows what we've got our remote control for the teleprompter yeah we've got some sort of bag that's super cool it looks like a skirt oh no that's for the cash it actually looks like a skirt but no that's actually for the camera that you have to put it in this but I know what that is for okay that's that then we've got Jesus Christ so I'm kind of like screwed look look at these screws I don't even know what this is like they're super long then with God the base for the camera which I'm just guessing pretty much that this is gonna be the base for the camera and then we've got another thing on the side here which I have no clue what it is and then we've got I sharpen this knife last time it's like so sharp now but here we have the bag for transportation we've got a bag to transport the teleprompter anywhere we go and that's pretty much everything in the box but I'll probably have to look at the manual because it has like 36 steps and I don't even know how to build this teleprompter oh I know where the screws go now apparently wow this is gonna be fun to do you know what guys I'll tell you what so this is pretty much for this video it's over and I thought it would be like a crap ton of fun this its idea was a crap ton of fun but I have to go mount all of this together because I have no idea how to do that and then I'm gonna make another video hopefully in the near future even though when I say that I'm never gonna do it I'm gonna make a video about the whole teleprompter setup and how it works so stay tuned for that but anyway like if you liked and subscribe for more unboxings and Apple news and stuff like that this is gonna go for good use anyway take care I'll see you next time bye [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
