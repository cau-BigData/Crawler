hello everyone and welcome back to this video about iOS 12.3 beta 2 that was just released for the public beta so everyone can go and get it this has been released just after two weeks after beta 1 and it is about 350 megabytes on my iPhone X s if we go into settings and general About section we're going to see that we are running iOS 12.3 if we tap on that you can see the build number which is 16 F 5 1 2 9 D which is the version and there are a few changes here so let's go ahead and take a look so if we go back into the settings and about section and we scroll down a little bit lower we can see that the modem firmware has been updated a little bit again we where previously on 1.0 5.00 and now we're on 1.0 5.0 1 so small update there which should fix some connectivity issues and so on another thing here is with the air pod so if you own air pods too and you would mismatch let's say one of them then it would show up a message here another small change was in the Settings app where if you go back here and you would go to cellular right over here now you can actually access cellular settings even if you're an airplane mode which was not possible previously now as you know iOS 12.3 beta 1 brought the Apple TV app the new subscription server that's gonna be available really soon but now in beta 2 if we go into the app we are going to see some changes here as there's not the same amount of content so before there was a sports menu here but it's not here anymore you'd have to access it by searching for it right over here so that's just a tiny change to keep in mind other than that this whole section looks pretty much the same now there was a major bug on the iPads where in your Notes app you could not draw with your leader your pencil or take notes but now that was fake so many people reported that now let's talk about the performance the performance as you can see is really really smooth I really really like it it's super fast there's no lag if you go into applications it's super quick opens up quickly and so on so no lag or stutter but I have been using it for some time now and I can say that the performance in this beta is better than the overall performance in all of the betas previously including iOS 12.2 where basically the performance was not so good there were many bugs and just overall the experience right here is way better than before the battery life if we go over to battery now here in the battery as we can see here there's not a lot to show but I can just say that the battery life has been a little better but really close to iOS 12.2 and pretty much the same as on iOS 12.2 and the battery life was excellent in 12.2 so if it stays this way I will be really really happy also the connectivity is really good Wi-Fi Bluetooth all these settings are really really good I really like it and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is working perfectly well this is pretty much the end of the video so if you enjoyed this video then be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music]
