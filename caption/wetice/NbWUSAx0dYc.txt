hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're gonna take a look at Iowa's thirteen point three developer beta 2 and it's came out just one week after beta 1 we are going to take a look at the changes the performance the battery life and many more things in this version so now the update came at about 295 megabytes on my iPhone 11 Pro right over here but this size will vary throughout all the devices however it should be below 300 megabytes and it will depend on which device you have so the first thing we're going to go take a look at is in the settings and general and About section and we go here software version you see we're running the build number 17 C 5 0 3 8 a so that's the build number the a at the end means that we are getting close to the final releases of this update and we should see the final release soon but I'll talk more about that at the end of the video and then one more thing if we scroll down a little lower we're gonna see that we are running a modem firmware this 1.0 3.0 9 and it went from 1.0 3.0 4 so if you've been having any connectivity issues then this should fix it for you so there haven't been any big features or changes in this update since it's already the second beta and in Poe into update we don't get much however there are many bug fixes throughout the system so the first big bug that we had in iOS 13 was RAM management and it has been here from 13-point 1.3 it would constantly a reload app so if you'd open this and then let's say you'd open Notes app and if you went back into the previous one it would have to reload all over again so this would be very annoying but luckily iOS 13 point to point to fix this issue and 13 point 3 beta 1 did fix the issue but not entirely now however in 13 point 3 beta 2 it is completely fixed and it feels like thirteen point two point two so if you don't want this bug in you're not on thirteen point two point two and you should definitely they too have better performance one more thing that is really important in iOS especially for me is emails so the mail application has been having many issues since the release of iOS 13 and it's just been a struggle so if you would 3d touch or haptic touch on something right over here and you would want to forward in the past it would pretty much crash so don't crash the email application or it would get stuck and it would not be very good however now you can forward easily like this without any issues whatsoever also if you were in the Notification Center and you click on an email then it would take you there but then it would delete all the other notifications which would be quite annoying however in beta 2 all of them are still there after that also marking emails as read is working 100% of the time if you want to mark them unread or read it works really well now whereas in the past it would not work all the time now one more thing that's really really interesting here is a dark mode so if you would go into your dark mode settings and if you have it sunset to sunrise then what would happen is that sometimes it wouldn't actually switch to light or dark mode so that will not work based on that time but now it seems to be working well in 13.3 beta 2 one changes here in Safari that now it supports NFC USB and lighting which is great news for those who really want that now what about the performance so the performance so far has been excellent but there were still some bugs and issues which made it kind of annoying especially the RAM management bug however no lag or stutter was present and the animations are all smooth and it works really really well beta 2 will be definitely better than beta 1 but we'll have to see and then I can report back battery life is another really important thing especially to me as I use my phone quite a lot during the day not a lot of screen time but I just use it a lot and Bachelor life is important so as see my capacity is at 100% so I am running a full battery as you can see last ten days I pretty much charged my phone every other day at the current usage sometimes I have to charge it more often than than usually but it's really good and very similar to thirteen point two point two and all of the other previous versions so I don't see a big upgrade in terms of battery life and it seems to be great now should you update definitely you should upgrade because it's gonna be better than the previous update for example if you're a 13.3 beta one then it'll be much better and if you're on thirteen point two point two then you will only see some minor improvements not big ones so you might just want to wait until the final release or if you really want to do it then go ahead it's not gonna be bad for your device now when should we see the final release of thirteen point three probably I would say towards the end of November because I think we will see one or two more betas so next we I mean like the week after next week so the week of the twenty-fifth is probably my best bet or early December well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed and please leave a like and subscribe and if you haven't watched my previous
