hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so today we are back filming on the g7x because today is a new review day so for you guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe please is going to be greatly appreciated for more reviews and for more videos in general but let's get into the video so today we're going to review the canon 100 D and this is a camera that I've been using for a long time this was one of my first cameras and it's really really good basically it does a good job with all all the things you would want on a camera but I'm going to talk about the few features and a few options that you need to do yourself otherwise it may not be what you expect it to be here is the camera this is the 100 D in his glory like this so this is perfect it's a great camera if you want to start recording videos and other videos that you want to just do if it's just an awesome camera for starters now you get you get this lens with it all right and this is a 18 to 55 millimeter what comes with it as you buy it so it's a really good starter lens but I would probably recommend that you buy a lens that is like wider the wide-angle lens if you want to do vlogs or videos like that outside I recommend a wide-angle but if you're on the video inside this land is really good for next thing is so the lens is it's quite good it comes to quite good length even though I would prefer like a bigger zoom and like more of wide-angle that would be a lot better now there's one thing that I'm going to say and it is that in most of the models of Canon up the SD card goes from the side or something here it's on the box so if you can see the SD card is right over here right so the MV card comes out here and it's kind of annoying if you have a battery grip because then it's not really good for you because then you just have to remove the whole battery grip and is remove all that as annoying also for the 100 D there is not a canon 100 the battery grip official canon other guy did not find one and what that means is that you can buy the third-party kind of battery grid but those I've changed many of them and none of them were good because all of them only one of the small window working for the battery works so that's not really good and that says that's basically the same thing as if you use this down here where you can put your battery it doesn't help you too much in to this so I would not recommend the battery group to spend like $100 or something like that so if you want to see the battery grip it's this so this is the battery drift and then I was talking in this door here only one of the batteries you can see I have only one battery there because the second one doesn't work and it's useless it's just not going to work you have many options over here as you can see where you can plug your microphone this is really one thing they really need in a camera is that you can plug an external microphone then you have the standard you know USB cable as close to your computer and HDMI and you can put a little headphones so that's good and that's important with the camera I recommend that you have an external microphone because the sound on this camera in the microphone is inside is not really good and the audio quality will be cracked now that's why on top here you have this little thing and that's perfect because you can put the microphone on top and you with sound the camera comes with a flash so you can easily flash whatever you want to that's good and that's what is needed to make something to do this this of course is a picture and video camera so that's doing one that's good because you can take pictures and videos at the same time now if you did not know this this has a touchscreen in it so basically you can use your finger to control any of the controls in the camera or the setting but if you want to use the standard button you were of course welcome to so that way you can control with touch screen you can change the picture you can zoom into pictures that's perfect if you need to do that now one thing they really recommend if you want to use this lens that is on it if you want to do that and you want to have great lighting you have you want to have good autofocus that you're in focus then I recommend you go off the automatic settings so automatic settings on this camera are a plus so eight plus this is this green button here you see and then M is for manual now you for sure will have to play with the settings yourself I'm not going to tell you too much but if you want me to make a video on manual settings and how they work with the aperture the ISO and so on just leave a like and a comment down below that if you want me to let you that video and I will be more than glad to explain it to you guys they're new with a camera the good thing with a manual setting is you can set the light you don't need to have so much light kind of you're going to have a leg up room even though I have five lights up the room I still use the manual setting because you can make it darker course so that's the really good thing about the kids that the autofocus points where you want it to also focus you can set brightness and so on you can sit in what kind of conditions you should think so you have a lot of flexibility with your camera once you want to go to menu settings now you have created also what is also kind of if you want to start very good because it has automatic settings on lighting all the focus and so on but and you can I think in the background but you can do that with menu but creative auto is more for if you want to learn a little bit and then you can go move to manual that's that's what I recommend if you want to learn first called creative Otto and then you can go to manuals and get some experience if you read some articles about goal-setting that's all the 100d has many settings and is really good for starters as I said and and it's early good beginners camera then of course you can move to more expensive and better cameras but I think for starters this camera is perfect frame so in conclusion I think this camera is a good buy if you want to start you just have to kind of play around with the settings and if you want to optimize it correctly and if you want to have good video quality and also good also focus and all the objects are there and that all the objects are in focus this is my recommendation if you enjoyed leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos and I'll see you in the next [Music] ah [Music]
