hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have some interesting rumors about the upcoming airports to the new iPhone X I and the Apple held March event but if you're excited for this video then leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more so in the past we talked about the March event right yes we did now several sources say that Apple will actually hold an event on the 25th of March 2019 well that's confirmed kinda I also talked about the two different versions of air pods - which creates a lot of confusion well what I can say now is that some kind of version of air pot stew will be coming on the 29th of March I would say that this is certain we will most likely see the small update with a wireless charging case and hands-free Siri but would that make you buy them probably not now here comes the solution for this we previously found out that air pots - are in testing so it is equally possible for the full version to come on the 29th of March but then again there is this one tweet that is stuck in my head it's my only saying that the real update will come in the fall of 2019 those air pods should have noise cancelling maybe some better waterproofing improved sound quality with an emphasis on the base a new color and finally a new texture those are cool right yeah I know but what isn't cool is when will they be available that is still unknown there is more information about air pods - as well the case should be a little bigger and longer to fit the charger but the craziest part is that they should be able to charge from zero to a hundred percent in just 15 minutes that is insane but for now we can only dream and wait for them to actually be revealed now I would want to hear what you think about these changes in the comments down below and also well they're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more let's leave this be for now and talk about the iPhones as there are some cool things to talk about there are reports that you will be able to fully submerge your iPhone in water and use it while in water as you know it's currently hard to even use the screen with a raindrop on it but with this new tank it would provide a solution I must say this is really cool another cool feature will improve the whole 3d touch / haptic feedback experience it's going to be called the directional haptic feedback right now when you use 3d touch it is just kind of a vibration on the entire phone but with this new technology it will vibrate on the spot where you activated 3d touch but I would love to hear what you think about these changes in the comments down below well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today but let me know what you think about all of this air pods - iPhone and all that and also air down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I will see you next time okay bye [Music] [Music]
