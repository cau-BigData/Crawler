Park this is matt from the vascular lab i have an outpatient here with an external iliac occlusion with coldfoot paid and number that studied three days ago what should I do with her hi this is Hannah I think you have the wrong number but I googled it and I'm pretty sure you need to put a stent in her life radial artery first of Lokmat so a wrong text number one and she even googled what it means and what is the next step to do and actually he replied sorry wrong number Hannah she ended up actually getting a stent took about three hours longer for trained medical professionals to figure out what took you three minutes great job who y'all hiring yeah well that's kind of this is kind of a funny text actually because she figured something else was took medical professionals three hours to figure out that's interesting another wrong number text and this is at the hospital we are at the hospital having a baby today sure dilated between five to six congrats low but I think someone got the wrong number then they send the picture seven pounds 11 ounces well I don't know y'all but me and the boys will be sued to take picture with the baby so sweet love his name Congrats lo zero six eight seven you are cracking me up sorry you got caught up in the baby birthing now that's okay what's the room number Bainbridge Hospital right we have gifts low low 130 come on and see us talk to you later sometimes you know you find these people would accidentally take someone else and then they become kind of good friends or something that's kind of an interesting way to meet new people this is just so funny because someone said a picture to someone randomly and then he replies with the same picture of him doing the same thing as this guy's doing so that's pretty funny actually a good job good job guys hey it's someone i'ma be in for a knife appointment today you know of any green where are you getting your eye appointment so she texted where what time it said we're like 10 miles well I don't know who you looking for but I'll meet you there with my dog and then he sends a hilarious picture of himself and his dog Otis to sheriff office even even funny wait a bit they send a picture of a dog who is this it's in a picture of a dog stop sending in pictures of a cat how how in the world is that a cat that's visibly you can see that it's a dog it's just why you do this no Jessica Jessica she send the picture do I look like Jessica and he says the worst picture possible to be said yeah some people are just crazy crazy picture of a cable this is a this is the standard cable you send the picture of a cat this is a standard cat with this well so some people just reply the same way someone asked them accidentally what's kind of a nice feature a feature it's kind of a nice thing it's kind of a nice thing to do to reply not just say like wrong number go away or something like that or be mean it's just a nice way but this will do it for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and until next time take care and I'll see you in the next video [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music]
