hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I like to talk about my experience with the huawei mate 20x for the past couple of days I've been pretty much using it more than my iphone XS just to make this video to tell the whole story and just see what I can come up with so this phone at 7.2 inches is incredible starting with just the face unlock which is just hold up super instant it's even faster than on the iPhone XS which is really really cool also the fingerprint sensor on the back works really well really fast I have no problems whatsoever I also said the layout of the swiping kind of mode instead of having the buttons on the bottom so it's kind of more natural to me because I've been using the iphone XS for a while now and I really like that a lot now the biggest thing when I started using this phone is how big it is now you might be like well 7.2 inches is insane but it's actually not like everything is just big you can read books you can watch youtube videos on a bigger screen you can do a bunch of things like this YouTube videos watching movies just somewhere in the bus or when you're traveling or something can be really cool on this phone and gaming as well gaming has been incredible as this phone can do a lot of gaming it comes with a seven nanometer chip with like turbo technology and like stereo sound and like great cooling so you can really play some cool games on this phone but now let's talk about the realistic part of this if you get what I mean the biggest thing that I love about this phone is the battery life so the iPhone has battery around 2600 I think this phone five thousand milliamp batteries so literally with just like normal usage if I go to like the battery section I'm at 34% should last 10 hours my iPhone 34% will last like an hour pretty much so it's in sane on like performance mode I can go at nine hours like fully charged it goes like a week like I'm not kidding literally just a week of like usage of like regular usage like browsing Instagram browsing Twitter like watching videos playing some games and just like a bunch of normal things browsing the internet it just lasts a super long time now the performance the performance that's something I would like to talk about because it just feels like when you're opening apps it just takes a little bit forever just like a little bit forever III don't know that's maybe that the iPhone is quicker at that or not I have no clue but I just feel that the performance could be better and there are some bugs like for example when you go to like an app for example that you can swipe in it happens to me constantly when I want to swipe out it like actually sometimes swipes still even when it's like minimized which is really annoying at times but overall overall would I recommend this phone yeah totally like it comes with a screen protector included with a case included triple camera lens which makes amazing photos by the way I love the photos that it makes but if you want to check out that video and also a video about videos you can wait for tomorrow and for Monday to see all of that because I made some really cool videos testing and comparing with the iPhone X s and there's some interesting results but you'll have to wait for that anyway really love it a big screen you can do a bunch of things on it so the battery life is actually the main point that I love about this but anyway this is the end of the video so please subscribe and like this video if you liked and let me know if you want more videos on this and I'll be glad to them because this phone is great anyway take care and I'll see you in my next one bye [Music] you [Music]
