hello guys welcome back to another video today I would want to talk about the Apple foldable iPhone and some of the more latest Apple leaks now will Apple respond to the Samsung Galaxy fold that is now available we will talk about some more Apple leaks I was 13 the a14 Bionic chip and some stuff about the 5g so if you're excited then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple news and a bunch more let's begin with the foldable iPhones as that is pretty much going to be the future where you can open up your phone make it a tablet make it into a phone just do a bunch of things with one device that can fit into your pocket the samsung galaxy phone is really cool even though it's at $2,000 now there's only two types of these kind of phones available so the price they can do whatever they want with it so even those people who really want to get a foldable phone $2,000 ouch is Apple working on this yes they are they have plans it's not a secret they've been working on this and they have many patents on curved displays and folding mechanisms for their iPhones now this question is when will we see something like this from Apple well not for the next couple of years it could take years for this to come and probably with Apple they're gonna wait until they see success in this and then come out with this for everyone so Apple could make some really cool stuff with this now in the meantime they are going to release the iPhone X I or the iPhone 11 however you want to call it but there's this one question that's going around will it be enough to just compete with Samsung and hmmm I don't think so Samsung's phone that is pretty much the same as the iPhone without the software is $100 less for a little bit better technology so $100 can be quite a deal-breaker for many people if they can get better for less they will have to focus on I was 13 more to compete with Samsung because their triple camera which is on the Samsung their Wireless casing which is on the Samsung and the reverse while is charging which is on the Samsung will not be enough so the s10 which is the phone we're talking about is $100 less and you have a really really really really good features on that I was 13 as something I love and I'm excited for as well now there's this one concept that really really enjoy and I hope will be coming in I was 13 it's by Lee ovale and he took I was 13 from such an angle such a perspective that's really beautiful he targeted specifically the iPads were the Magic Mouse 3 the smart Keyboard 3 could be working on it as well as the trackpad which would give so much more potential to the iPad to even become a small computer that's very compact it will also bring support for an external display which is currently only on the iPad pro and some more multitasking as well as a control center with one interface as you know now when you swipe up to close the applications that's one part of the control center and then you have to swipe from the right corner to open up the control panel they could put this all together and Leoville a did it really well also he says that they will keep iPhone 6 and s II support dropped the 5 I get the find but the 6 would be just really dumb for them to drop as I believe that a majority of people have an iPhone 6 so this could be realistic and I think that Apple's gonna keep support for the iPhone 6 and se series but if you're excited for all of this this concept and all of this then leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent news and let's get into this report from Mac's wine back which we talked about in my previous video where I was 13 we'll be bringing dark mode but he says that it's not that simple he says that dark we'll be coming in Iowa's 13.1 and updates to the original 13 that's gonna come out in June now I would say that that would be their main selling point for the iPhones to have dark modes so I don't think Apple's gonna push that back and like delay all of that they would lose a lot on that so I think that by June we could still see some changes in this as it's really really early and also one more thing I was 13 will include an optimization of Safari Safari looks like a dinosaur like from the dinosaur era it's really old and it's been here for a long time digit time also reports that Apple will be switching to the five nanometer chip in 2020 which would be cool as we have a seven nanometer chip right now and the five nanometer chip would be more efficient would provide more battery life and would require less power to run which is all good and good but we have to wait for that till 2020 let's like watch 5g because this is really important and that's the next generation of cellular data so Verizon right now is pretty much the only one bringing 5g to the network which kind of says that it's really coming and probably five you will be coming to the phones in 2019 but I think that Apple will wait till 2020 to see if 5g is really successful and whether or not they can get into it so Apple is not usually the first one to do these kind of things so we'll have to wait for that okay this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe to stay updated with all the recent Apple announced and I'm gonna see you guys next time bye [Music]
