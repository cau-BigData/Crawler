hello everyone and welcome back to another video we have some crazy news today about the iPhone 12 and an iPhone 9 plus yes alongside the iPhone 9 Apple is working on a plus sized version with a 5.5 inch screen let's start with the iPhone 12 because I'm really excited about this one we have a source saying that the a 14 processor that will be in the iPhone 12 will exceed the 3 gigahertz range for the first time ever it's not only the first time on the iPhone but on all smartphones in the world for the past few years many phone manufacturers are basically trying to catch up with Apple but now Apple is making an even bigger leap that will set everyone else back the single core score on the a14 is reported to be up to 50% faster than on the previous a 13 we don't know actually how much faster it will be until we actually tested but it's already a good sign that Apple is able to keep progressing by speeding up the devices year after year 9 to 5 Mac has reported that the time-of-flight camera will be only on the iPhone 12 Pro based on the code discovered in iOS 14 previously we thought that all iPhone 12 models this year will have the time of flight camera but now it might only be the two high-end models the iPhone 12 pro and the iPhone 12 Promax this will help with 3d mapping around you and will be used in Apple's augmented reality apps for better performance which are also leaked in the iOS 14 code one very good example is the measure app nowadays it is just using the regular camera on your iPhone and the measurements are really not accurate at times however with the new time-of-flight camera the measurements in the measure app will be so much more accurate but we still don't know if it will be actually able to replace an actual tape measure this feature will definitely only be on the iPhone 12 Pro Series to create some sort of different she Asian between the different models of iPhones now the iPhone 9 plus that has been leaked in the iOS 14 code we already knew about the iPhone 9 but an iPhone 9 plus should be coming as well the iPhone 9 series will look pretty much like the iPhone 8 with the glass back since this was discovered in the iOS 14 code by 95 Mac this device is certainly going to be released very soon it is going to come with a 5.5 inch LCD display but we don't know if there will be only one or two cameras there will be an a 13 processor touch ID and an NFC sensor which was not on the iPhone 8 at the time of the release so you should take this device as basically an upgraded version of the iPhone 8 with some different features and some upgrades to the already existing ones the iPhone 8 is becoming quite old at this point so it only makes sense to upgrade it to the a 13 processor which will make it extremely fast the price for the plus size model will probably be around $500 with a regular sized one at $400 we know this because that's how Apple usually differentiates different sizes and that's how it was in the past with the iPhone 8 series further we have also learned that you will get the dual stereo recording mode on the new iPhone 9 lineup basically it records your voice from both sides stereo and makes it much louder and this feature was first introduced with the iPhone X s last year however we have no idea when the iPhone 9 plus will be coming but we know that the iPhone 9 should be just around the corner another product that is on the completely different side is the new generation of air pods digit x has been pretty much the only one talking about the new air Potts but we still have no actual idea what will be new this should be the regular version of the airport's but they are being referred to as airports Pro Lite which just add the confusion so could they be an entry-level earpods pro or like what there have been some rumors that these could just remove noise cancellation altogether as the only difference between the two versions of course Apple is working on new air pods but no one knows what exactly will change and when they should be coming well this is the end of the video so if you enjoy then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you my next video [Music] [Music] you
