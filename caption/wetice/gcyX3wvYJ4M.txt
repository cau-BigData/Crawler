what's up guys oh we have some great apple news today we have our first look at what could be the iPhone 13 a black Apple pencil might become reality the iPhone 12 will be delayed by a little bit and some rumors about another iPad in the line getting USBC as well as a ton of other news so let's dive right in starting with the iPhone 13 because that got me excited this leak is from actual COBIT over on twitter who has really been leaking a lot over the past few weeks so this could be our first look at the iPhone 13 but I don't believe that although John Prosser is saying that the design of the iPhone 13 will be identical to the 12 basically making it kind of a 12s however a more trustworthy source left a dream is saying that the 13 will be different from the 12 so you will really just have to wait and see who is right in this game from this image we could say that the iPhone 13 might be getting one more camera taking it up to four and it seems like the lighter sensor will be just put underneath but that's not everything actual COBIT shared the cameras could be going up to 64 megapixels now before you say that this is obviously fake it's not Apple was already talking about a 64 megapixel camera a little while back for the iPhone 12 but it didn't work out for a reason or another so it might make sense for it to make its appearance with the iPhone 13 so the first lens should be a standard wide-angle with 1 X optical zoom and up to 6 X digital zoom the second camera is a telephoto lens with up to 5x optical zoom another 40 megapixel ultra wide lens with 15 to 20 digital zoom and finally a 64 megapixel anamorphic class the anamorphic lens is used in movies so it should give the iPhone a more cinematic look so they would essentially be going from like 12 megapixels all the way to 64 which makes an extremely huge jump it doesn't seem to be realistic though so take this lightly now regarding the iPhone 12 that we should be seeing in a few months from the beginning of the coronavirus we have been hearing about possible delays digit times is saying today that all iPhone 12 models will be delayed until October of 2020 this would be definitely a big change compared to what Apple did in the past but it's expected due to the coronavirus situation this is probably the most logical rumor today so this is probably going to happen what about the iPad Mac at Saqqara is reporting that the iPad air will be for the first time getting USB see we have been hearing a lot from I'd love to dream what the iPad Air's design would be similar to the 11 inch iPad pro with the in screen touch ID as well as an a 14 but it is possible that Apple will remove one iPad from the lineup to make space for this a new what seems to be amazing iPad air regarding the iPad Mini we will definitely be keeping the Lightning port so don't expect us be seen on that one just yet love to dream also shared what is to come on the next generation of the iPad pro love to dream says that the upgrade in the first quarter of 2020 will be much more significant than we saw this year we are talking about 5g support and the mini LED screen which I am actually very excited about so there have been rumors of utter black Apple pencil as there have been rumours about black air pods which is very exciting except the source is not very trustworthy and doesn't seem to have a track record so take this lightly we cannot prove this so I don't think we should get too excited just yet either way this is all I have for you guys today if you enjoyed the video then please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I will see you in my next video
