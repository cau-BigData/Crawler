hey guys and welcome back to another video how are you today today's another great day to record a video because today it's almost Christmas as I say in the past videos but today we're actually going to bake cookies for Christmas now today we're behind the tree that we did in the last video so that's great so today we're going to bake some Christmas cookies so here we have the dough so we have different kinds of cutting out pieces that then we can have different kind of cookies so you can see these are the ones we have and we're going to use them to basically cut out something out of the dough so we're going to put some flour onto the small working area but then it just doesn't stick because last year I remember we had some experiences where it got stuck so we have this so we're going to split the dough in half just to have easier working I guess so we're gonna put the half away for now and we're gonna use it later so with this half we are going to use this tool here and make it all the way that it is about 1.5 to 2 centimeter so now I have the thickness of about two centimeters here we have the pan over here where we're gonna put the different shapes and cut out using all these shapes that we have here let's get started so I'm gonna start with a small Christmas tree firstly let's see because we're gonna start here at the edge there we go and take it out and we have our first cookie so we're gonna put that one on the pan now I'm gonna use different kinds of now so let me just do all this and I'll be back so with the rest of the dough here as you can see that was left over from the cutouts we're going to put it all back together again and we're going to roll it out again to about one two one one and two about two centimeter so we are done with the first part of the dough so we have the other part over here this is the other half of the dough so we are going to use the other rest of it to basically complete everything and this pan as you can see here is already almost false there'll be only a few cookies we are going to fill the other one and then we are going to go put it in to the oven and bake them and see the final product I'm excited for that so over here we have both pans with the gingerbread cookies now we are going to go put them in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes and then we're gonna see the final product I think they'll be quite good I spent a lot of time cutting them out using all the shapes we had and I think they will be tasty plate and taste the dough it's very tasty let's go we are walking along with the cookies we are going to go to the kitchen now and we're going to put one here the other one here let's wait for it to bake and then we're going to go back and test them so the gingerbread men are now in the oven baking so actually they're starting to get bigger and bigger what's great and we're going to take them out shortly maybe in like five to ten minutes so here we have a tray where we're going to put them it's very nice with some Christmas motives and we're going to have the cookies on it so that is the plan we're gonna wait for the cookies that they're baking down there and then have them all the way here so we took the cookies out of the oven they're all here and here these are the two pans you have them on now I am a little bit concerned because they seem to be soft but they should be kind of harder so I don't know if they are good or not but we're going to see once they cool down and then move see and we're gonna go back and look at them and taste them anyway we are done with the cookies now now I'm going to try to attempt with a knife to remove them from the pan because they're kind of stuck now as every year let's hope that as little as possible will break okay so we have one that's well it kind of is broken but it could be worse but I already did two without any problems so the success rate is good so some of them broke but some of them are fine is this kind of star for example they're all good now I'm going to do the other pan and then I'm going to show you the final product that we're gonna do a taste test so we are done with the gingerbreads here they are we are going to do a taste test that's probably at least 20 of them they are all different kind of as you can see different shapes and christmas-themed shapes so let's try one of them to see if it tastes like some kind of gingerbread they usually get harder over time right yeah so they're good they taste like gingerbread I guess I'd say they're kind of soft but they'll get harder every time so this is it so if you enjoyed this video please leave like down below and subscribe for more I'm gonna go enjoy the gingerbread and I'll see you in my next video take care I'll see you during Christmas yeah okay bye you
