hello everyone and welcome back to another video today's an exciting day because today we've got this to unbox I don't know if you can see it clearly but this is the Canon 5d yes the 5d this is gonna be an insanely big upgrade to what I currently have 61 insanely it it's quite a big deal for me it's supposed to shoot 4k which the 60 doesn't so towards the end of the video we're going to take a look at the video test so stay tuned for that now let's get into the unboxing I would normally unbox this at man boxing station but the box is just way too big for the setup so we're gonna have to do it here but let's just start into it not spend a lot of time unboxing it because I really want to test out the video compared to the 60 so on top we just got a CD and instruction manual that's it yeah the one missing part in this unboxing is the lens which I already took out but either way this is the Canon 5d Mark 4 with the lens here yeah so it's with this lens so that's basically all this says inside the box we've got a charger as well as the charging cord right over here and another cord oh because they shipped it to Hong Kong so they gave me a UK plug and an American plug that's nice then this was a set so I got kind of this cleaning thingy and then of course you've got your battery and so that's pretty much the whole first section my hair is doing a weird thing today that's the first section what's this oh that's another cable for oh that's the HDMI cable and and the thing for your computer Wow so that's all the cables right there and then just beneath here we've got the actual camera so of course we've got our strap right over here which is also important so we've got that as well as the camera right over here so this is the the camera this is pretty much all that it is so this is the body of course there's some major Frances compared to the 60 there's gonna be a lot of videos about the 5d and the 60 and some additional photography things so the main difference here it doesn't have a flip screen anymore which will be quite annoying but now I've got the Handy display up there so that I can bypass the whole situation here so of course this does 4k video at 30 frames per second compared to the 60 doing maximum 1080 at 50 so that's quite an improvement going to 4k and then additionally the one change you have is that you can use an FX or XD card you know one of those big SD cards so you can use that as well as an exact art so you can put two cards in there for your files to go of course then you've got your battery hatch down here where you put your battery the battery the good thing is with the batteries is that they're LP e six something like that which means they're compatible with 60 the ATD the 5d and that's all I know but that's great because I don't have to change batteries all of them support the same batteries so then of course on the side you've got your input for the flash you've got HDMI which is important if you want to plug in an external display and then you've got your USB port as well as your mic and headphone port and then of course your jack on top and the wheel and that's it so that's great that's pretty much everything that's important on the body now let's go take a look at the camera quality alright so I'm holding the 5d right over here this is what it is I'm just gonna walk around the office a little bit I'm of course holding it in my hand but now if I go back to my set we can see on the 60 so this is the 6d this is how it looks on 1080p 50 frames per second and this is how it looks on the 5d Mark 4 at 4k 30 frames per second now of course I don't see what I'm doing so let me know in the comments down below how it looks does it look better is there a big difference or is it about the same let me know well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed and please leave a like subscribe and hit the belt stay notified when I release my next video especially in the coming weeks about this camera also if you forgot to watch my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video you
