you might already know that aperture is one of the most important variables in photography of course alongside ISO and shutter speed if you missed my previous video about shutter speed then please pause here watch that one and come back later firstly what is aperture we can easily say that it is the opening in the lens through which light enters the sensor comparing it to your eye for example the aperture is basically the pupil of your lens so what does aperture control it controls two main things the exposure and the depth of field let's start with how aperture affects the overall exposure in your picture we have a large aperture meaning that it's more open and more light reaches the sensor and then we have a small aperture you guessed it it has the opposite effect of course you can also have something in between the two extremes and that's called a medium aperture and that's just in between now that we understand how aperture affects your exposure let's take a look at the more creative side how does aperture affect your depth of field in simple words depth of field is the amount of your photograph that appears sharp from front to back some of your pictures might have a shallow depth of field meaning that the background is completely blurred and is out of focus and some a deep depth of field meaning that both parts of an image are completely sharp so the back and the front with a shallow depth of field you are able to create images that separate your subject from the background remember that a large aperture creates a large amount of background blur also known as boki and a small aperture makes the image completely in focus you will most likely use a large aperture for portraits or any scenario where you want to separate your subject from the background for landscape and architectural photography a small aperture will be the best way to go if you look at these two images courtesy of photography light dot-com you will see what impact a large versus small aperture might have on your subject so now that you understand how on earth do you adjust this parameter and your camera it will be reflected as an f-stop or a f-number your aperture will be expressed in this format for example f/8 you will be able to change it based on how much light or how much depth of field you want in your image for example you can have f-stops in this range but it can go lower than that more about f-stops in another video so how do you select the right amount of aperture firstly it depends on your scenario and whether or not you are shooting at night or during the day when shooting during the day your apertures will look something like this and during the night they will be inverted and look something like this you might be confused right now because you might want to shoot a shallow depth of field during the day but can't because of how bright it is this is where aya so and shutter speed also come into play because you can compensate for the added aperture with these other two parameters it is all about tweaking your camera so that you can take the best pictures possible the only one thing you have to keep in mind is that not all lenses have a very shallow depth of field or a long aperture some lenses can only go to about F 4.5 but some can go up to F 0.95 it will be usually written on your lens glass underneath the cover see what kind of lens you have and don't be discouraged if you cannot go to very long apertures these are the basics about aperture that you need to know for the beginning to be a great photographer now it's your turn try to go to the aperture priority mode on your camera which will allow you to just tweak the aperture while the camera takes care of the rest this way you will be able to really master and see what aperture does to your photo of course if you are nohow shutter speed and ISO works then just go into full manual mode and start creating stunning images well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed and please leave a like and subscribe as it's all greatly appreciate it and if you want to see another video on my channel then please click the card shown up here or just stay till the end and you will see some suggestions ok take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]
