hello everyone and welcome back to another video first video after I came back from holiday I am super ready to start and today as you know from the title we are starting off with an unboxing of the mighty iPad pro here it is this is the iPad pro 2018 version that I just got off the shelf as you can see we are running the 64 gigabyte iPad pro 11 inch just with Wi-Fi no cellular because I find that cellular addition to your iPad is not really that practical because you can just share your internet from your phone via a personal hotspot so the additional 200 bucks is quite a lot for me so let's go on with the unboxing so simple and boxing here of this iPad pro tier this easy peasy lemon squeezy peel off the plastic and we are left with this amazing box I love the texture the texture here feels so nice and the image is one of my favorite images ever that Apple has made now let's get this thing open so if I slide this thing out it kind of works like an iPhone if you didn't know here we go here it is so here it is let's move this away for a little bit so that we can open this baby up so if we just peel off the plastic while looking at how thin this iPad is peel it off beautiful beautiful and we've got the iPad pro in our hands so as you can see the screen is quite interesting we have visible four cameras on the top they are of course for face idea and there's only one camera that you can actually use but here it is this is the backside of the iPad pro for those wondering the Space Gray there's one camera on the back that's quite big interestingly and it's only written iPad right here I thought it'll be written iPad pro but it's only I'd back let's send this off to the side and let's continue with this box right over here so let's see our documentation because that's something interesting as you can see they just say iPad pro there's some random stuff about the iPad pro in multiple languages whatever we don't really care about that and here we go so this dongle is new this is something I never saw in the past so we have this adapter thingy here it's not a dongle but just let's leave it at that let's remove the protective stuff which is nice to have but not necessary this is a new design I'm really surprised that they didn't keep the square shape that you usually have but instead give you this so this comes with another cable for your charging which is USB C 2 USB see right over here now this cable seems to be quite the short cable in my opinion but I think it should be as your standard cable that you have for your iPhones 1.8 meters yeah that's what yeah that's pretty much your cable so USB C of course into USB C of your iPad that's right over here so USB C so USB C charging so the USB C allows you to pretty much plug an external display you can pretty much plug a hard drive an external drive with the USB key or whatever you can pretty much even transfer photos from your camera directly into your iPad which is really really cool in my opinion and that's pretty much everything in the box so yeah well this is pretty much the end of the unboxing so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and leave a like if you're excited that I'm back unless you're not excited I'm back anyway take care and I'll see you in the next one bye
