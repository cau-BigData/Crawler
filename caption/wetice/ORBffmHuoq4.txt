what's up guys we have news about a potential Apple game controller a new iPad air with touch ID under the display and a new MacBook Pro as well as new air pots coming in May there is so much to talk about here so let's get straight into these all these leaks are coming from very trusted sources on Twitter especially at love to dream at the beginning of March they tweeted that a new iPad pro would be coming in the third week of March and it did further they tweeted that more products are coming in March and they were right after just the week before the new MacBook Pro they tweeted that it would come and it came so from this we can really see that their track record is extremely good let's start with the game controller because this is something really unexpected from Apple with the Apple arcade they are really going to focus on gaming so a controller really starts to make sense this might be coming later this year or early next year but it's still interesting that Apple is finally entering into the gaming world at least let's hope so if you remember about 2 weeks ago we had leaks about the iPhone 9 plus or what's going to be called the iPhone se plus 95 Mac confirmed this around the 15th of March because of code found in iOS 14 but left a dream is saying that it will be coming in early 2021 however John Prosser tweeted that a new 13-inch MacBook Pro will be coming in May as a replacement for the old 13-inch we have now further he said that the new air pods are also on their way next month the 13-inch MacBook Pro will have a few upgrades but what exactly is unsure just yet however if you are looking to buy a 13-inch MacBook Pro now then it might be best if you wait a few weeks and see if there won't be a newer and better model available now we have been hearing a lot about airports pro-lite which digit times has been talking about for the past few months last year Apple released the air pods Pro as the highest dear but on the bottom we have the basic airports - with some good features however there is nothing between the air Potts Pro and the air Potts - just the price tag of a hundred and fifty dollars so from this it is really starting to make sense that an airport version between the highest end and the lowest end will very likely becoming a new Paris coming at a lower cost but in the shell of the airport's pro which at first made no sense at first I thought that it would be a new generation of the airport's Pro but that's not going to be the case so why is it still referred to as air pods pro-lite well because it is going to be sitting between the highest end and the lowest and air pods well because it's going to be sitting between the highest end and the lowest and airports which now makes a lot of sense the price of these new ones is even more interesting apparently it should be even cheaper than $160 which can be a game-changer for many people with this in mind you would be getting new air pods or your first pair of ear buds let me know in the comments down below further on this topic John Prosser is saying these air pots are ready to be released and it is just a matter of time when so new products are basically all coming in May the iPad air should be getting an all screen display with an N screen touch ID sensor which is quite impressive the display should be around 11 inches similar to the iPad pro with mini LED technology there will be no face ID but the in screen touch ID will be quite cool to test out Apple was rumored to be doing that in the upcoming iPhone in 2021 so it will be great to test it out on the new iPad and see how good it is well if you enjoyed this video then you know what to do please leave a like subscribe and hit the bell to stay notified when I release my next video follow me on Twitter for more frequent updates and I'll answer any questions you might have also if you missed my previous video then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video [Music] you
