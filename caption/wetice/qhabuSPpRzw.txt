hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we're going to talk about the Huawei P 30 Pro this is the comprehensive review after my whole series on this phone comparing different aspects so if you didn't watch any of that I'm not gonna go into too much depth in this video so please click here there's the full playlist that you can watch all the different videos on the Huawei P 30 Pro now in this video I'm just going to talk about my experience and kind of give you a final verdict from the whole summer series of Huawei p30 Pro so starting off the screen size is amazing the resolution is great everything works really well performance wise however I've been missing the battery life of the May 20 X as this one is only at 75 hours instead of 120 as in my testing on the mate 20x in regards to photography this phone is amazing it makes beautiful landscape images beautiful panoramas beautiful portraits and so on except the colors could have been a little better but you can of course edit that in your video editing software or your editing software for pictures like Photoshop or so on now it also makes great night photography I compared that to the May 20x and there's a video you can click here if you want to see more on that it's impressive it made a dark scene look light and beautiful instead of making it super super dark well the camera is amazing the front camera has been upgraded to 32 megapixels which is insane to see on a phone like this you can take beautiful pictures really in terms of everything else performance is very fast for me I usually don't do much on my device because I have a computer but for those that are looking to edit pictures on their phone then you might go for the model with 8 gigabytes and maybe more storage so you can store more files on your phone but there's a lot of versatility here right on this spot now my experience throughout the past one month that I've been using the phone it's amazing it feels good in the hand it's not too big it's not too small you can really see what you're doing on it however I like the touch sensor isn't as sensitive as I would like it to be so I tend to either type the passcode or use face recognition so that could be something that's improved but overall I'm not complaining the phone is excellent I love it so much in terms of video mode I forgot to mention that the audio quality is very comparable to the one of the g7x it is impressive how clear and crisp the audio is on such a device I previously had issues on the May 20 X where there would be distortion between right and left microphones on the device which I don't know what was causing it but now I do not have those issues anymore it's crisp clear and equalized which is great to see so you don't have to really do a lot of work in your editing software and it makes great audio well now would I recommend this phone for anyone who has the money to buy it who wants to take pictures and all of that yes I would recommend it so much this phone is great it pretty much beats the iPhone in terms of camera of course me personally I prefer iOS but the Android version the Android 9 is great really it is an upgrade the apps are even upgraded on the p30 pro compared to the may 20x so everything is working perfectly over here well this is the end of the video if you enjoyed then please leave a like and subscribe for more videos like this and if you forgot to watch the whole playlist about Huawei then please click the card right here ok take care and I'll see you in my next one bye [Music] [Music]
