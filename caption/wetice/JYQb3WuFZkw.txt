hello everyone and welcome back to another video did you ever wonder if you could replace your pocket camera by a phone well in this video we are going to see if you can replace your canon g7x mark soo or any similar vlogging device or camera with the Huawei P 30 Pro the p30 pro comes with four cameras on the back end one camera on the front there is the wide-angle lens the ultra wide-angle lens a telephoto lens and a hallway time-of-flight camera also called a tof camera you might be asking what on earth is the tof camera well that is very very simple the tof camera takes care of the auto focus the contrast focus and hallways artificial intelligence image stabilization these cameras come with an aperture of 1.6 to point 2 and 3.4 respectively on the other hand the front camera comes with a standard lens at 32 megapixels and a 2.0 aperture that is pretty darn incredible anyway that's enough information let's go take a look at how the canon g7x mark ii competes against the huawei p30 pro now please pay good attention to the audio and the video at the same time to see which one is better we will start with the back camera on full auto on both now I'm looking at the g7 X talking to the g7 X XI listen to the sound how does the picture seem and now I'm talking to the p30 pro the Huawei p30 pro does it seem better doesn't seem worse g7x p30 you should an XP 30 which one do you like let's go take a look you saw both videos the g7 x mark 2 has different colors for sure it seems more natural whereas the Huawei p30 Pro seems more color corrected however the p30 pro is way crisper than the g7 x mark 2 it really looks like a tie now in terms of audio quality it is very hard to make a difference as both of them sound so good and so clear however it seems like the audio on the huawei p30 Pro is way lower but that can be adjusted and corrected in your video editing software I just don't really know which one is better right here let me know what you think about both of them in the comments down below now the front camera again pay good attention to the audio and video to see if it's good for daily blogging now we are looking at the front-facing camera on the Huawei P 30 Pro and still there's only one camera on the g7 X Mark 2 so that's the same thing does it seem better or worse after carefully reviewing both of these videos it brings another dilemma I think that the Huawei P 30 pro is brighter than the g7 X mark 2 in terms of colors I feel like the g7 X mark 2 did better as it looks more natural again compared to the Huawei P 30 Pro which looks way more saturated and more color corrected the audio is as crisp as in the previous test as we didn't change anything now the moment you have been waiting for can the Huawei P 30 Pro replace the canon g7x mark 2 yes I believe you can vlog or record on the Huawei P 30 Pro and make excellent videos using it it brings the added benefit that you can have a phone and your camera in one instead of having a phone and a camera of course it doesn't replace a standard DSLR but it replaces your standard pocket cameras thank you for watching if you enjoyed this video and learn something new please leave a like and subscribe also if you missed my previous video on Huawei then please click the card shown up here okay take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you
