hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I'd like to talk about iOS 12.3 the whole release in general as this would be most likely the last release of iOS 12 this will be prior to the released of iowa's 13 coming in June for the developers and in the fall for everyone the whole public there's nothing much happening in 12.3 but there are a few things that I'd like to share with you but if you excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe it's all greatly appreciated now let's get into the video the main thing in this update it got updated is the Apple TV app so if you go into that it has a new icon a new layout completely new and you might be asking why was this changed well Apple is getting all ready for their Apple Plus streaming service subscription service which will be a paid service coming very soon the TV app has simplified categories it has some movies it has a bunch of other things here that you can go and look at you have movies TV shows sports and the interface is very nice bright bold colors everything just seems so nice so this will be for all the people who will want to subscribe and watch stuff on this and will for those people who don't it's just a new app so you don't really care probably another thing in this update is in the wallet app so if you find your wallet app I don't really use it much but in your wallet app you can have your cards a bunch of other things and now there's a new longer transaction history you can also see the location where you made your purchases so let's say I don't know two blocks from your house or so it's gonna give you the specific address so that you know if that purchase isn't from you Apple is also working on the Apple card you might have heard that it's gonna be a card by Apple that will be made of titanium will have the NFC functionality and this card will be introduced to the wallet app pretty much in a beta or just kind of an update just here in the summer so the apple cart should be coming in summer of 2019 and with that could come just a small update introducing the card well I would have hoped to tell you more about this update but as you know we are at the end of the Iowas 12 beta cycle battery life has been really good for me except in some Vedas but overall it has been quite good as well as the performance the performance has been really really really good I have no complaints there and throw the whole betas and throughout all I was 12th the performance was just super fluid super fast no lag no stutter everything was working really really well well let's hope that iOS 13 beta 1 will be even faster than iOS 12 beta 3 as this could have some improvements and hopefully I was 13 will make it even better well this is the end of the video so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and also let me know what you think of iOS 12 in general and beta 3 especially in the comments down below okay take care and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music] you [Music]
