hello everyone and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about the Apple watch Series 5 let's take a look at everything we know about this watch that is expected to be released in September of this year but if you are excited for this video then you know what to do leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more if you remember 2018 was a big year for the Apple watch it got massively redesigned and remade which caused it to be very successful however we will probably not have such a big update this year but we should see some small updates and upgrades the screen will not change this year and it will stay oled if we are already on the subject of screens then according to Reuters Reuters Japan display will manufacture the screens next year you might be asking why am I talking about this so well in the future probably beyond 2020 Apple may switch from OLED to micro LED screens and this could be pretty much the next generation of screen technology however for now Apple will stick with OLED screens for this series and probably a few afterwards anyway let's look at the features now we should be seeing solid state buttons which basically are buttons that just vibrate instead of actually being pressed or moved you will feel a vibration so it's kind of like on the iphone 7iphone a type of thing where the button doesn't really go in but just actually vibrates which is something new and will be cool to see and it has some benefits the watch will be less prone to malfunction as now something can get stuck in the digital crown for example but that should be fixed with the vibrating things also there will be more room in the Apple watch which will allow for a bigger battery if that's something that but we'll do that would be great as I would love to see my watch last at least a couple of days without charging instead of charging it every day and also another advantage it would be way more water resistant as it would be pretty much totally sealed these upgrades sound cool ya know if you remember way back in 2015 the Apple watch Edition that pretty much failed because of 12 to 14 carat gold and who would pretty much buy a watch so expensive however Apple changed it for the next year by introducing ceramic watches instead of the gold but this lasted only for just two years pretty much because as you can see series 4 does not have any sort of addition but here comes the good news maangchi Kuo says that ceramic could be coming back to series 5 this would mean that Apple watch Edition is coming back this year also some health features can be added however that is mostly unknown but this feature is pretty much the main selling point so I think Apple will make something interesting here well I think all this sounds cool right yeah but we just have to wait a couple of months as well specifically until mid September of this year to see more well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know what you think about the upcoming Apple watch and whether or not you'd get it or not in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more ok take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you [Music]
