all right hello and welcome back to another video today today I'm going to continue talking about Amazon Alexa but I'm not gonna talk about the favorite feature that you saw previously today I'm going to talk about the worst slash missing features on Amazon LexA so I'm going to start - the first one which is basically that you cannot call or message when you're in Europe it's a feature only available to the US if you don't have a u.s. number then you can there's no way of bypassing that unless you have a u.s. number which in Europe you're probably not gonna have so that's a very big debt that's like a very big point here and one of the biggest in my list is that you should just make it work because like with because with Syria just tell her and she does whatever you need with messaging calling but of course that's on a mobile device so that makes sense but that's maybe something that Amazon fixed that is available in Europe as well now one thing that really influences me a lot is that when you say Alexa ok turn on TV okay or turn on bed or whatever your lamps are called for example then you have to say them separately you have to say everything separately for example if you're making your shopping list you have to be saying things separately by saying Alexa da da da da da okay so it's very annoying to be doing this even maybe I mean maybe there's a function in the LX app that I have not found but that's like one main concern I have and if you guys know about this and know how to fix it or activate setting or something then let me know because I really want to know that because it's really annoying me by just you know saying everything all the time one by one to add something to lists that's like a big no-no so so that's like a very big you know like missing feature or something like that unless it's already here and I'm just stupid now three is I heard many people talk about this and I understand why and it's the audio jack for it to be more smart so thought I mean with that that by just telling her you can switch okay between like an external speaker and the internal speaker so if you say for so you would say Alexa turn on internal speaker that would switch her by her dad that would switch her to the internal speaker and if you'd say Alexa turn on external speaker she would connect to the external speaker that means you could just have an external speaker plugged always but you could choose which one should be like talking into because now if you plug your speaker Alexa is going to only talk into that speaker and as if the internal speaker was not there shoot is not like talk into it it's just gonna be the external speaker so that's something I really hope that in like the third generation maybe they were introduced something like that that you just tell her and she switches the speaker she's going to be talking on what would be a great idea in my opinion so that's a missing feature now one thing that I found kind of difficult when I got Alexa is the commands that you tell her sometimes they become really complicated or maybe that's just my personal opinion going from Siri to Alexa they're the commands seem to be longer more complicated but of course maybe that's just me being used to the Siri commands and not feel like sigh command so this is just like a very small point but the commands should be shorter and now I'm not sure if it's Alexa or Amazon making the commands or each specific skill that is making their own commands so just maybe shorter commands and easier to memorize commands now the last one is you know many whoever has Amazon Alexa there is the Alexus skills where you can browse like over 10,000 skills I would say I don't know like more than 60% of them are just skills that you would not use and are just like skills just be there you know more skills that are actually useful and have a meaning rather than having skills that are just doing nothing or just you know you get the POE and skills that are useful should be there and on the front page and not propose skills that don't have a meaning or a purpose at the immediate moment so you know you can spend hours and hours browsing through all the skills to find one skill that really makes sense so that's something you should work on but it's my opinion again but anyway if you enjoyed this video and the previous video then wish to leave like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'm going to make a review on all of this talk about alexa more of how i use it in everything and kind of put these together so if you've not managed to watch the previous video just go watch it and then watch also the review that's gonna come soon maybe I don't know June yeah something like that alright but if you enjoyed this video you know I already mentioned everything you have to do well you have to know everything I would like you to do anyway take care and I'll see you with my next video bye [Music] you [Applause] [Music]
