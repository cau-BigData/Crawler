hello everybody welcome back to another video today today's another great day because I was twelve point one point two has been released so it's an official release for the entire public so everyone can go and download this update this update doesn't contain much it's a very simple update with just a few bug fixes and some things happening in China so this is a very early release and it surprised me because usually there's couple betas before the official release of iOS however this time it came out very quickly because of some very important fixes and some news in the update now first of all the app switcher seems to be a little bit fixed however there are still some problems that with some apps it can just still kind of crash that I don't know if that's just the app or the phone but it seems to be better than before so well what's new are there's some features are there is there anything new otherwise well Apple has some problems in China with the patent infringement on a company so they had to redesign some things in their features and that's basically the reason why they rushed with the whole update of iOS 12 point one point two now it's something to do with the picture is something to do with resizing and reformatting images which may be a change but I can't notice a change in the pictures or anything it's just pretty much the same now there have been some fixes to the Eastham because more and more companies are starting to roll out the ECM so the support is kind of going globally now and it's going quicker than I expected as well and the cellular connectivity in Turkey has been fixed and I heard there have been some problems even in the US and in the in countries of the world where there were some problems with the connectivity but that should be resolved now and should be all functional and working so this update is not very big it's just kind of a small update to fix something some bugs but hopefully in iOS twelve point 1.3 or something like that there will be something better and like more features which hopefully that's gonna come in the next update as well as a fix to the app switcher which seems to be still kind of ish buggy and some kind of problem there so yeah well should you update honestly I mean it's worth the small bug fixes but there on the other side there's just kind of a problem with the app switcher which is kind of important for everything you do on your phone so unless it's not urgent well then just stay with iOS twelve point one point one the official release or in some beta and C and wait for the next update which should probably come shortly so for now just I recommend wait and you'll see whether or not it's better but for me the absolute sure is kind of ie so I don't know what to do but if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future it'll be greatly appreciated and I'll see you in my next video okay bye [Music] you
