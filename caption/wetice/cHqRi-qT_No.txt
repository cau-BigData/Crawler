hey guys welcome back to another video great day today today I want to do like a quick unboxing and then go to the point of this video this is also not a paid endorsement but today we're going to be unboxing the Philips you light bulb so this is no toy unboxing today just brief and boxing and then I'm going to talk about how to pair your light with your with your hue bridge and your application and home kit that's the point of this video now little unboxing as you can see this is the whole box that the packaging comes you just have like a small ticket here there we go open that open this quickly there we go remove all plastic and gently take out the light bulb so this is what you open up now as you can see the light bulb is packaged inside and you remove the packaging and you reveal the light bulb so this is the whole Philips hue light bulb that you get so once you unboxed the Philips you light bulb you need a lamp where to put it we're going to take this lamp here there's just like a standard lamp hole where you can put the light bulb in so what you're going to do is screw the light bulb in there you go let's create it there we go now as you can see this is just my special lamp the light bulb is inside when you turn it on its going to be orange so as you can see the light is orange so to send this up you're going to take your phone and what you're going to do on your phone you're going to go into you're going to go into your Philips hue application which you can download at the app store now you're going to go to settings and you're going to click light setup now you're gonna click the plus and you're gonna click search so now it's going to see you're gonna see that it's searching for the lights and once it's going to find this one as you can see you color lamp one that's usually what you're going to find and pop-up and that's this lamp that we have in this here and now you're gonna click on it so as you can see it kind of flashes that that's the correct clamp just click the information button now you can rename it in my case I'll just name it PV because it's gonna be next to the TV so that's what you can video name now what you can do next is go back what you're going to do next is go to a room setup click on your room and then select whatever lamps you want to have in that room so that depends on the lamps you have in the room so I'm gonna select this one because they are all in my room and I'm gonna click Save so then it's gonna say let's say if you could take a while but it's usually very quick as you can see now I have five lights in my room so that's done so that's literally paired so now you can go to the home and now as you can see wait let's just click my room and you're gonna see the TV land over here so I can turn it off as you can see now the lamp is off and also since this one's a color one so I can go ahead and change the color to whatever I would want so that's basically the Philips hue setup now I hope I explained this well I think I did so basically it's just working perfectly for me this is how I pair all of my lamps and this is what I've been doing for the past a long time now so you can do this with whatever lamp you have now if you want me to make a more in-depth how to like set up your hue bridge and do all that let me know and I'll do that but this is in for this video if you enjoyed visually like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you in my neck video bye [Music]
