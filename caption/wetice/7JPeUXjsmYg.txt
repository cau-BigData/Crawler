alright hello everybody and welcome back to a new video so in the past I recorded a video about Joby Gorillapod and one of you really good great people left a comment and the comment was that I had problems I had problems with this Gorillapod this is the 3k I believe and then you have the 5k what's above it and they were also going to look at this Gorillapod this is the 123 25 gram one which is a really small one for like the g7x or something like that and today we're going to be unboxing this this is the gorillapod 5k so let's do a comparison this one versus the 3k versus between 325 gram 1 so as you can see there is quite a big difference between the three of them so just a standard unboxing cut with this without cutting my finger I'm pretty sure you don't even have to cut this but I'm doing it well we have the plastic off good and now crack it open let's see I'm taking it out there we go there's nothing else in the box obviously so here it is this is the gorilla pod it's really really good I'm your new remove the knife all right so now let's try to do a size comparison so here we have the 5-game here we have the 3k and here we have 325 so this seems like a really good size comparison and this one is really like a lot smaller than this one is not expected and this one seems to be like metal like a lot more rough than this is like plastic which is a really cool feature and of course I have the ball head here which is a lot smaller on this one but I don't have it currently so first of its feels sturdy and it feels like a metal like this piece feels like metal whereas here it's plastic that's like the first big thing I notice is it's like the first big thing I notice is that it's all metal and a lot more sturdier oh yeah this would be way better for vlogging than this like okay let's let's do a size comparison here it doesn't even fit in the screen so I'm gonna go put the ATD on here and I'll see how it feels so here I am on the gorilla pod already it's quite interesting it's in the height where I'm sitting so it's almost as the camera that's behind like look look this is the level here so it's really good it's so sturdy like wow so just go and look over here so this is the the camera that is here and if I go and zoom in on the viewfinder there I would like to see it in the viewfinder a little bit so here is I'm really trying my best here here is the gorilla pod over this and it's really sturdy to feels I can just put it down it's really really working well and as you can see on the other camera it's rather a lot bigger than the previous one so size comparison another one this is how it'll be before and now it's after so at least like three or four more of those small balls and bigger so Wow just actual Wow and also I was really surprised by how really good it is when you need to like tie it down here over here there's like a small wheel there's a small wheel here which you can turn and that releases the camera from it which is what it does is that you have a small so you have like a small thing here an attachment similar to what I have from the small one but on the small one it's just like a small really plastic thingy whereas here it's a little e sturdy and made from metal and it feels even the heavy and everything about it it's just like a lot more sturdier and on the bottom you have a nice thing here let me show you you have a really nice thing to turn everything around to tighten it really well and as you can see you can put it in whatever orientation you want and then it has this kind of nice slide on effect so here you just okay show you here so here you have the Shai pod and you just slide on you just slide on the camera here literally a slide on so see slides on that and then just what you have to do is tighten this small thing here and it makes it tight so whenever you need to release it just works perfectly and then you have a more another kind of turning thing here or you can turn this to move around the camera which is better for different positions when you want to vlog and then you just tighten it to keep it in the position you desire so you have a sturdier grip in my opinion and if I show you a little bit here so you have a sturdier grip you can really put it like this that you can hold it further away from you so you can really let me just turn the th√§rning turn anything off yeah like this so I can really just like hold and vlog like this with no problem so really happy that I got this one and especially it's gonna be interesting when I'll be vlogging on the 6d to make it a lot more light weight and then I can have it further away from me so here it is this is the new edition really happy with it but this is what I'll wrap the video it's becoming a little bit long so if you enjoyed be still live like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and I'll see you next time with another comparison or unboxing video of something else all right take care and I'm gonna go enjoy this alright bye [Music]
