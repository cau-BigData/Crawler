hello everyone and welcome back to another video today we have a new report to take a look at concerning the iPhone se 2 this iPhone could be coming as early as this year so here's why you should wait if you are on a budget and want an iPhone but if you're excited for this video then you know what to do go ahead leave a like and subscribe to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more we got a report from PC tablet but before we get into any of this I would want to say that this is my first time using this source so everything is subject to change however there are a few reasons why I believe that their support is true one there are facts that are confirmed by other sources and 2 PC tablet says that all of this information is from someone inside Foxconn India anyway let's get into the report PC tablet reports that we should be seeing the iPhone se 2 with a four-point inch screen that will be edge to edge there is a possibility that this iPhone could be included in the iPhone X line alongside the iPhone XS a couple days ago maangchi quote said that we should be seeing a smaller iPhone in 2019 the 5.8 inch iPhone should be going down to five point four inches so are they talking about the same iPhone well that is unclear we could be seeing this one instead of one of them or just as an addition to the line however this report says four point eight inches which is way smaller than the one reported by maangchi quote many of these details match the ones we have heard in the past the iPhone se 2 will not have a glass back but rather an aluminum back as this reduces costs on leaks shared a render of this iPhone and how it might look with the aluminum back as you can see there is and anything conflicting here further PC tablet reports that this iPhone is going to a face ID and a 12 megapixel camera as seen on the iPhone next are the processor could be the a12 Bionic if we follow the best trends with the iPad and so on however PC tablet doesn't say anything about battery life and storage capacity all of this information came from a source inside Foxconn India also as you know Apple has been struggling with iPhone sales this year due to the high prices and less frequent updates of devices this new iPhone could be Apple's reaction to this situation to increase their sales and revenue the SE 2 would be the low-end model at not so high price at least cheaper than the most recent models the SE 2 could cost around $600 which would put it lower than any other iPhone available I mean the newest one right now this would help their market in China and other countries where they are struggling well that is pretty much everything I have for you guys today let me know if you think that this would help Apple and whether or not you would buy this iPhone in the comments down below also while you're down there consider leaving a like and subscribing to stay updated with all the latest Apple news and a bunch more okay take care and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
