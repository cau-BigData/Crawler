hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video how are you today let me know as always today I'm super super excited because today is the day when I actually started making these videos and in general when I started making vlogs so this is a very special day it's the fourth of September and this day has a lot of meaning to it because I on this day decided to take my camera they've bought like a week prior to this no no no I bought this camera a couple months ago and then this day I decided to take the camera out just put myself in flight you know in front of the camera on a chair and have my wall behind me and that's what I decided to start vlogging and making these videos this day meant a lot because it was just like this and I and I wanted to make that video and then you know I never knew that I would achieve something this high and if I should talk about it last month of August I got a thousand abuses in the month this is something crazy and crazy alright but anyway I'm gonna talk about that maybe later or something let's just start today's video anyway this day is very special and for this special day I just want to you the vlog or basically I talked about what will I be doing and it changed all so this will be my first vlog ever alright guys without further ado let's start watching I'm wit ice gamer and welcome to something new so this is a vlog type of video so you know I want to say alright the first thing that I noticed is that my voice changed but that's pretty normal and also this is a vlog type video that I enjoy that thing I mean I didn't there I did not even know what I was doing at that point I was completely panicked pretty much I did not know what to say what to do and if you listen let's just continue if this videos will be a little special because I'm not gonna be like a special type of lover where basically I'm going to be making vlogs daily no I'm gonna be making vlogs when I have something to show you guys and something that I feel like giving out to you guys okay well at this point I did not even know that basically I will be doing just these kind of videos so pretty much my plan back then in September was that I'm going to only you know do my gaming videos and do some kind of special type of vlog videos next to it so that changed now it's purely purely these videos and I enjoyed more Hey so what I'm gonna mostly do with the trips and journeys okay I am going to basically make it this would be like the scenes of the trips underneath okay so it's going to be basically where I'm gonna be blogging all day when we go somewhere and then in the evening or the next day I'm gonna put out the blog and the trips in journey video will be a separate one okay so that will be a different video so there were two videos why don't you be kind of now if you noticed I was using a lot of so and okay and then the only reason for that was that I was completely panicked and I did not know what to say so I just kind of you know was thinking and in the thinking process I just said so and okay yeah I think I changed that thing with this thing okay so this thing basically I put it on and put it on my lamp okay and then I was speaking into this webcam okay I still have this webcam it's a creative webcam and then over here I just skipped a little part over there you saw that basically I was talking I'm just gonna talk about it because I'm I'm gonna watch an entire video with you guys but I'll leave the video in the link below if you really want to watch the video what I really do not recommend anyway I talked about the history of my microphones what's quite an interesting story if you want to watch that I'll link it in the description as I said I and just watch my history of microphones I literally started with a webcam now as crazy as it sounds I started with a webcam anyway alright so this is my first vlog now I hope you enjoyed this video maybe those are too short for you but I really appreciate all the support that passed over the one year September to September really really appreciated I went from like 100 views to a thousand what's like wow thank you very anyway this was my first vlog I'm not very proud of it uh yeah I was scared I was just not not myself like I am now speaking normally I don't care now if I'm in front of a camera the camera represents you so anyway anyway guys this will do it for this video if you enjoyed bitch dream like down below and subscribe for more videos like this in the future and if this video was kind of repetitive I'm sorry I just you know enjoy this day and I I think a lot so anyway take care and I'll see you in my next video bye [Applause] [Music] you
