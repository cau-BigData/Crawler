hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video so as you can see today we are in a different spot than we usually record our videos because we are somewhere in nature on a mountain in austria in Heinberg coastline broke at least and well this is where i want to talk about copyright music and all the music you can use on youtube because basically you know that on youtube you can have only no copyright music or corporate music what you need to pay for some kind of rights for it or you can just download some no corporate music that are on the internet all over the place that you can get some some people to cooperate with you that's another example but if we start with the null corporate music that you can download on the internet where there's still quite a lot of it you can basically you use bass treble that's one of the music i was using before and then basically you can use a different kind of music from there so as i said your second options for music is paying a subscription to some kind of firm that you can find on the internet me personally i started using monstercat not so long ago because it's a really good company for music of different styles we have house electronic and all different kind of music genres that that can just make your videos really really good and if i go back to the first one as you know the first music it's free and no copyright so basically there's not so much effort put into them as into a paid subscription and basically you're not going to have the same quality of music with that now the negative of course with the subscription is that you have to pay for it monthly or yearly or depends what kind of plan you're going to take and you have it's just kind of expensive but the positive is you have thousands of songs off of no copyright music that really will make your life a lot easier because you have on one website and you can find music sorted by genres and by other albums and different kind of sorting energetic ambient or cinematic or different kind kind of music types you can have the third type of music you can use on YouTube is just try to find a small youtuber that is making I mean starting to make music and you can collaborate with him just you know you can find small channels like that easily by doing some research on youtube and I use some music like that already and I found a few so basically you can really have three types of different options on YouTube for music and it's very very simple so as I said with the third type you have to do a lot of research science on youtubers who are willing to collaborate with you and give you some songs that you link them in the description or just kind of promote them in your video or something like that you can agree with them through email or just contact them and it's going to be okay for for music for a while okay so if i should recap everything together so do you have many options for youtube music except of course some of them are better some of them are worse it all depends on how you want to have it if you want to go if you're starting i would recommend the due to research and you use vegetables or nocopyrightsounds and then whenever you advance that you want more music to make better shots and better music in your videos I would recommend you to go to mosque monstercat or epidemic sounds this both of them are really good but i prefer monstercat because it has more of some kind of energetic and kind of more electronic and house music that epidemic sounds so that's why I chose it but eventually i'll probably also try epidemic sounds for some different music so it's all up to you and number three is just find some composers of music and and just collaborate with that they'll be more than happy to share the music with you and you will have some good music with you on phone okay now for the conclusion of this I really like to use music in my videos and you know that every video has different music and it really makes the video a lot nicer and load vector now for the end I'm going to show some examples okay so i'm going to show bass rebels [Music] you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ha [Music] Oh and now I'm going to show some on circuit example [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so i hope you enjoyed this video if you did be sure to leave a like down below it will be greatly appreciated and subscribe for more videos like this and yeah if i did not answer all your questions we should let me know down in the comments section and i'll answer to all of your questions yeah okay take care and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music]
