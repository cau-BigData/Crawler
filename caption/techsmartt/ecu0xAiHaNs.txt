in the comments if you guys actually guessed it right let's do it sweet so if you guys want to check out the fake iphone 8 plus that I picked up I'll leave a link down below I spent around 116 bucks which isn't bad and on the site there are two options you can get a few different colors but there's a real fingerprint model and a fake fingerprint model and of course you know your boy he got the real fingerprint model because like we got to know what we're getting for 116 bucks and how close these things are so let's go ahead and check this out I got a real one right here and a fake iphone eight plus right here I want to see if they got it right I really want to see if they got it I did this video last year on how to spot a fake iPhone 7 you tell me right now which one you think is real what you need think is fake that looks identical if you ask me when you're doing a Craigslist deal sometimes it's really easy to tell the phone is real or not sometimes it's really difficult here are some of the pointers that I'm gonna give you guys on the front of the box I don't know about you guys but it's kind of hard to tell the only thing that I really see is different is the buttons the real box has like tinier buttons compared to the fake one if you can get a friend to loan you like a real iPhone eight plus box which I don't see why they wouldn't like if I was your friend dude well I am all your friends if you guys need an iPhone a plus box hit your boy up just at text mode on Twitter if you're not following me I'll give you guys one too legit check so let's check this out on the side says iPhone iPhone pretty similar got our Apple logo there all right if it's a sealed phone you're definitely gonna want look for this the pull tab that Apple has this one's sealed this one is kind of like shrink wraps that's a dead giveaway dead giveaway do you wait Charles thank you very much giveaway it looked really the police are coming the police are coming to get me for my fake iphone like for real other than that they got the Box down pretty well looks a little darker on the fake one you're not gonna be able to tell just from your eye on the back this is where things get really funky it's like they didn't even try the labels not even straight iPhone isn't even spelled no it's spelled right I mean it's not that hard to spell iPhone it's not capitalized the way Apple does it that's a dead giveaway make sure you just check the back of the box that'll honestly help you the most so let's jump on into the real one here and just like the packaging this is shrink wrap this has this like nice pull tab it's been like this for a few years now so the real ones here let's open up the fake one here and see what we're dealing already know what the real one looks like you guys probably know it too oh wow all right but just opening this up for a hundred and sixteen bucks it wasn't even lined up straight choose wring mode and silent you're supposed to get Apple stickers and a bunch of other paperwork did I not get Apple stickers I was pissed about this last year and it's not elegantly put in the box like Apple does it it's in a bubble wrap carton all right oh wow yeah oh okay all right so this is the fake one what are their accessories we got we got the air pods nope not the air pods Keaton come on Bank giving those away for free got the ear pods lightning cable rip alright pretty generic stuff last year old wild they threw in a bluetooth earpiece what is this and that was amazing okay sweet pretty sweet stuff let's hop on into the real one just that sounds better when you pull the top off here we got our manual here you're looking for Apple stickers of course I mean Apple isn't gonna forget their own stickers I mean this is the real one of course another man you another manual all right pretty chill pretty chill now let's actually jump on it hard I mean we got this that it's cool I mean you guys know the accessories of this it's not new the one dead giveaway though is the lightning adapter we didn't get one of those in here I mean there's no headphone jack on the iPhone 8 plus if you don't get an adapter you know it's Fugazi it's a lousy it's a woozy it's there's actually whoa like last year there is a built-in screen protector I don't know if you guys can see that too well oh yeah oh baby that is just a dead giveaway that is a dead giveaway in the US I'm the real one here there's no other markings except the word iPhone on the back if someone's trying to sell you a phone that has any other junk underneath it is fake that is a dead giveaway that's probably one of the easiest okay yo whoa the display is coming off the phone already I can see it creeping off a little bit that's also a dead giveaway we're finding way more giveaways than the iPhone 7 video last year I am blown away I thought they would have this down like it must have watched a video from last year okay so haven't both of these in my hands the real one is definitely heavier than the fake one I don't you guys can tell too well but the front looks pretty much the same on the bottom this is a dead giveaway look at the Lightning port it's really flush and just kind of built in there whereas on the real one it's kind of sticking out a little bit has an outline on it what else dude like it this one looks whiter than this one like it it looks whiter what okay alright let's just turn these things on we're definitely have to jump on into it just to see it like how bad this is I don't know maybe it's gonna be good let me know in the comments right now if you think it's gonna be good or bad I'm hoping they got this down the phones are powered on and one thing that I'm seeing right off the bat before and get these things set up is the screen is bleeding on the fake one that's a dead giveaway the screen is looking funky and it's not consistently lit it's a fake like right here it's bleeding and on the setup screen there's actually the accessibility dot if that is showing up on your iPhone when you first set it up in Craigslist it's probably a fake like doesn't come with it by default what's really interesting though is the fingerprint so I got the one with the real fingerprint I want to check this out so real one here the fake one here let's see how well all right dog I just put my fingerprint on it and it knew that's like some iPhone 10 stuff right there all right let's try this not bad I had to like push down whereas on the real one I just rest my finger on it and it actually unlocks the phone also I just thought of this this is probably the easiest giveaway bring like a wireless charging pad computer like one of those battery packs and just try it out I'm a real one and as wireless charging built-in you guys know this on the fake one see if a wireless of georgia's no there is not wireless charging built-in so on the real one there's one key feature this is new on the iPhone a plus it's portrait mode so if you don't see a portrait mode it's a fake phone that's that is a dead giveaway I wanna take a picture here I'm gonna take a selfie fake phone real phone let's see how they look and also if it doesn't just seamlessly open and it gives you the the image code at the top it's probably a fake phone like that's that's not even close let's check out control center this is new on iOS 11 not bad I was honestly thinking they go with the Iowa's 10 control center just cuz like it's easy why not but they got it down flashlight how are the flashlights ah this one it's like a halo if you really look into it you really look into it you can see like a halo there's no halo on this one that's also a dead giveaway interesting like this phone I feel like kind of got worse honestly I could spend all day comparing the real one to the fake one basically just take some of these tips when you're buying like a phone on Craigslist and you're easily gonna be able to tell if a phone is real or not thank you
