Wizkid guys keep you here so we're about to check out something crazy super interesting and something that I never thought would be a product and I know I say that a lot but this time I really mean it basically you guys know this meditation grooves name is Deepak Chopra he's an absolute legend in the meditation community well he came up with a product this is nice pretty face here Kemp with the product known as dream goggles and basically what they claim is the minute you put them on you are instantly relaxed in this state of trance so just relax let's go ahead and open this up and see if it's good so these cost around three hundred bucks you guys I'm check them out I'll leave them link down below wannabe iPod here some of the features that's how you're gonna be feeling if your legs aren't criss crossed and they're isn't fun lights coming up what's really up you know you're not doing it right at that point and then there's the legend himself wait a depop dupe of course that's my man Deepak so let's open this up now Deepak Chopra is always chilling with Oprah so I'm wondering if she's tried on the Dream Weaver glasses I wouldn't be surprised like Oprah is pretty tight Oh Ron King do I mean hope is pretty cool like I don't know if that was the best word there so here is the white iPod the dream master Deepak Chopra how many iPods you see with the name on the front let's see what else we get all right so we got the Dream Weaver sleeve this is what you put the glasses in in between wow it's a sweet ricotta it is a sleeve Weaver so here are the shades they kind of just look like average sunglasses this kind of looks a little bit like the glasses that keep you awake basically they're these glasses they detect when you blink you guys it's a video I'll leave a link right up at the top there I do it right wow these are not like those cords of course it's a cord sticking out the sunglasses see that time got some like white strips on the inside portion test that's where you know the weaving is gonna happen the charging cord and then another Oxford I'm guessing that's just to connect the weaver to the bottom Oh headphones I did get the ones that come with the headphones nice little earbuds check these out this seems like decent here but it's better than just the standard ones you get with a phone and then a micro SD card because you can load your own meditation music or if you're in the mirror and you're like hip-hop bro Drake album ah oh oh yeah oh yeah that feels good dude easier buds they're cheap but they don't feel cheap and that's what matters nice little tight fit didn't even have to use the tips no tip I'll give you a tip I assume so this is a dream ass right here it looks like an iPod Classic I know it's got Deepak Chopra's name on it so to power this thing on you have a power button that's red at the top so you have four different modes in here you have sessions actually going on like a meditation weaving session give your audio settings and then USB when you want to plug in so let's check out sessions so there's actually an SD card that you can put at the bottom just a micro SD card and then two headphone ports once or the actual earbuds the other is for the glasses because your glasses now come with the cord welcome to 2018 do look at this clip wheel doesn't even click well it clicks a little bit but it doesn't scroll so headphones go in the headphone port once you switch them around let's fucking the glasses now cool all locked in do these dreamweaver glasses are supposed to boost productivity meditation creativity and tuition personal growth sure it will you'll see the basically do this by flashing some red green and blue LEDs in here and you're not supposed to open your eyes in a session so if you only wants to do is put these on yeah this oh wow though you can't see you can't see through these glasses would have been nice but I think it kind of goes against the whole point of being meditated in relax Kyle did you see in this so we got three Weaver that's when you want to go into a session and then you can actually toggle on strobe like specter strobe so this is like accelerated you see it ID ragazza light where's the red LED is that I think that means kind of like angry in terms of moods and colors showing blue lights here blue and green gonna see what these look like now I can't just put them on my face let's switch it to a different mode here let's try wake up kind of still early in the morning it's like 1:00 p.m. the countdown we throw the glasses on put the ear buds in for the full experience whoa whoa whoa whoa oh wow dude I feel like I'm deaf punk right now I just see a bunch of LEDs blinking at my face this one elusive dream feels like it's supposed to substitute the beta thinking and implement data thinking that's what it says just even he'll be like I don't feel like it's this healthy have your eyes it's close to a bunch of LEDs blinking I feel like I'm getting epilepsy you look I'm on elliptical it's not that bad like I don't feel ice cream yet only bean use it for like two minutes so I'll let you know if that changes but so let's change this up and go into a meditation center so dreamweaver mode but god he does how i say let me know in the comments if you not I say that right oh wow almighty relationship and also devotion so as you go along with any
