let's go guys welcome back to tech smart and yesterday was a huge day for Apple they released three phones and a watch my favorite part I'm so stoked for the series for it was calm overall a big day a lot of stats but the one thing that you probably saw if you watched it or caught the live stream eat it you guys missed that it's right up there in the iCard but they kind of focused on more of a refresh and more kind of getting the iPhone 10 from 2017 up to speed in 2018 and really being a powerhouse as you guys can probably guess there's no discounts going on for the phone last year it's the same shape and design as the last one so I guess that's why they're keeping it there's two new phones out and which to you buy it's kind of expensive they go over $1,000 if you want the excess max the big one go well with this 6.5 inch screen the big bad one but whatever one's probably gonna pick up that's just my guests I don't really feel like it's a huge difference compared to the iPhone 10 the only difference that I see is in the iPhone 10 max hey you might be different so let's run through it so if you guys happen to miss the event you weren't on Twitter or you didn't catch the livestream here's kind of what's new with the iPhone XS and XS max they're pretty much the same except for a few different things the first is and by the way this is an XS Max clone this just showed up and it's kind of a good reference point for me to have something that isn't a hollow clone so what I can say is with a 6.5 inch screen that's kind of the new big differences here this is the largest phone Apple's ever made is Samsung actually made a six point three inch phone back in 2013 and I never thought phones we're gonna get that big or even catch on so it's crazy that we jumped up in inch and we're now on the 6.5 inch iPhone so what's really new is the color now comes in a gold on the iPhone XS or X x max it's storage they boosted it up finally so it starts off at 64 gigabytes goes up to 256 and for the super sweet premium model that's new this year 512 gigabyte so now you can get a phone made by Apple that has half a terabyte of storage which is kind of a big deal phones are really evolving into computers because I don't know about you but I actually like not using my computer that macbook life it's too hot another big change to the XS and obviously the Macs family I'm just gonna call it the XS family so you guys know it's on the same phone is the a12 Bionic chip so they always update their new chip each and every year when a new iPhone comes out and with the 812 ionic it kind of caught me by surprise and this is something I got a test so I'm just reading what you guys probably saw too they have 6 cores and then 4 cores that are basically dedicated to the CPU and GPU so the new a12 is one of the first 7 nanometer chips to go in a phone but with the new a12 chip what's awesome is it actually consumes around 45% less power than the iPhone 10 which is a huge win and I guess that's why they're not selling it anymore and another thing is the GPUs are actually 50% faster which is really awesome because mobile gaming has become a thing if you guys are playing for tonight or Pub gee let me know in the comments I go on Bowl from I'm only good at pub G so that's probably where you see me just techsmartt the new way 12 Bionic chips pretty sweet because it actually comes with an updated neural and I'm really pumped another thing that's dope is the dual SIM card support so if you're international in the US were kind of spoiled with one carrier now stock comes on both iPhones the iPhone XS and then the XS max so that's perfect if you're in a country where you want to have one SIM card for just calls and then the other four data and then switching out around as you travel it's amazing and the dual SIM phone in China is actually the cooler one it like flips over and this is instead of two sips it's pretty sweet so that's probably the one that I really want to pick up on the XS max man that's a tongue twister there's not really much new in terms of like physical changes on the XS family but the camera has a new wide-angle lens with smart HDR if you guys have ever heard of the Google pixel you guys know what the Google pixel is the pixel to excel and my daily driver I love that thing I'm stoked for the pixel 3 Excel basically Google has this kind of software that Chris stitches photos together so as soon as you click and take a photo it actually takes a few photos and stitches together to composite the best one this kind of beat on the XS and I'm honestly shocked it wasn't just on the max cuz that would have made me buy it kind of a big deal photos look good there's a new portrait mode where you can adjust the depth of field pretty solid really want to see if other companies start to catch on because then photos are really gonna jump up and then instagrams is not real but outside of there having a 5.8 inch screen and a 6.5 inch screen both of these guys have up to big abit LTE speeds so it being dual SIM this new a12 chip these things are kind of packing a punch better life is gonna be a huge decider on which phone you go towards the XS or the max so I was kind of shocked and I actually booed if you guys saw the livestream make sure you check that out in the description if you guys missed it and then they dropped this bomb so the XS max has up to 90 minutes more battery life that's just on the talktime side so it's gonna show all around and same with the new XS I'm guessing it'll be able to perform better the new a12 actually uses less power so probably gonna make a huge difference over the X versus the XS so if you get the XS you're probably gonna notice a better battery life experience over the 2017 iPhone 10 and it's starting to really upset me when companies say phones have an all-day battery life that does not make any sense if you're a different user than me and you like to game more than I like to watch youtube videos or just write emails cuz basically I don't have a phone anymore that's a whole different story and my usage and battery life experience is gonna be way different than yours so setting that I don't think makes a lot of sense and on the XS max that's the only notable improvement and this is kind of the bigger one this is a huge difference in why you want this one and I totally think the max is gonna be the one everyone goes for in gold trust me it's the iPhone 5s if you guys remember how hard it was to get the gold color all over again the next big kind of debate is price so luckily the iPhone XS and then the Max and I just tried to turn on the Cologne it's dead if you want to see this thing work you know the video is coming up soon I'll leave it in the description is a secret link so the excess goes for $9.99 and then the excess max goes for 1099 so basically you're paying around $1,000 for the new iPhones what's interesting is Apple's not giving you any other option they discontinued the iPhone 10 from last year so your only choice is to get a brand new phone or the XS or the XS Max or your good friend the iPhone XR and that's my favorite phone so if you guys missed that video it's right up there in the iCard but if you want to get the spicy 512 megabyte model it's gonna cost you thirteen hundred and fifty dollars for the XS and then the max is fourteen hundred and fifty bucks as you guys know they discontinued the iPhone 10 this year and it's kind of interesting what other phones they discontinued so they killed the iPhone 6s and the 6s plus as well as the iPhone se and seriously I'm just wanting to know I'll be in the comments after this video for probably a few hours let me know if you guys had either of those phones and how your phones are running and if you guys are the ones that are looking to upgrade because I think that's the case this is the S here the kind of refresh similar design as you guys can see and more specs it's I think it's really interesting know how the iPhone 7 are you really good phone goes for four hundred and fifty dollars now and then the iPhone Inc goes for six hundred so you can definitely tell Apple shifting their focus to the older phones as more of the budget options and not gonna make a hundred dollar iPhone 6s oh I'm probably you've been leaning towards the 256 gigabyte max which is gonna cost twelve forty nine then the excess for 256 gigs is fifty so eleven forty nine verse twelve forty nine for me this is the one I want I really want the Mac see you probably due to getting extra battery life and paying a little extra money if I'm paying a thousand dollars I might as well spend a little bit more there's no real big difference at this point and honestly I find that the bigger screen and bigger battery life and I just see the bigger price makes sense and well that's the one I could kind of think I'm gonna but the XR is gonna be my daily driver in the one I really want it's just not out till October so I just posted a tweet and definitely make sure you're following in case you guys aren't so I'm probably gonna do this again basically let's see what you guys think about the new XS and XS max boom here we go which do you think is better man which one if you're gonna get one do you think you'd go for it what do you think about the XS and the XS max is there one you definitely want more than the other yo it's good Jacob from Oklahoma did you get to see the new iPhone XS and XS max I just if you could just say one phone that you like better excess or excess max boom hey what's good what's your name where you calling from yeah it's Quinn which one so everyone's kind of leaning towards the max that wants the battery life for obvious reasons and then the XS if you just like small phones and you like the iPhone 10 now so I'm gonna take like 2 more calls and we're gonna see what you guys still are thinking what what one do you like better the XS or the max nice to meet you Nikolas did you get a chance to watch the Apple that BAM you saw the new XS and the max which would you pick what call you're gonna get in it Oh so I actually got to turn this thing off because you guys have been blowing this up ever since the livestream and definitely drop a leg and you want me to do this again it's kind of fun to talk to you guys and get your opinions basically for a video that's going out real soon so I might do more of that or like a livestream so you guys obviously want which iPhone excess to get the regular or the max and I'm gonna tell you you're probably gonna want to pick up the max in gold it's gonna be a heat on September 21st just be safe that's all I'll say so that's it for this video if you guys are new make sure you click the
