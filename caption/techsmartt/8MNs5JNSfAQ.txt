hey whiskey guys welcome back techsmartt and this TV right next to me is really interesting have I mean what are you thinking it's tech smart dude it's always interesting this TV though in particular is made by hi sons and big things to them for sponsoring at this video if you want to check out the H 90 plus its link down in the description but here's why it gets spicy this thing costs 700 bucks and there's actually a 65 inch model which costs a little more but this thing is a 55 inch 4k u LED this thing looks amazing and for $700 it has Android TV Google assistant andr 800 Oreo and it's 4k and look at that picture on the boxes are you getting that I'm getting it so this is really fun because I haven't checked out a TV info and I can't start getting into more tech more TV more monitors more gaming just stuff it's a little bit different and this is a great starting point and let me know in the comments what kind of TV you guys have super interested to know the size boat up in the iCard there I know 55 inches at least for me it's kind of the perfect size so I want to see for 700 bucks what high sense is cooking up okay how do I get this thing out without breaking it it's so paper thin I don't want to snap it that's like when your tech is too good it's too good I'm scared to pull it out of the box so I finally got the h9e all set up it took like two three minutes had some helping hands of Isabella so it really worked out this TV looks really freaking good in the remote it's got this nice kind of grippy texture on the back here on the front super easy you have Netflix sling youtube google play and with sweetest since this thing is android 8.0 Oreo you can actually download apps from the Google Play Store which is a huge win something I'd want on TV and what I really love is the Google assistant button super smart she actually works will try that out in a sec but like just just look at this it's actually really thin it's not one of those TV set acts really thin at the top and then is huge on the bottom I'm shocked with how thin this TV is not even feeling or curves because it's literally a vertical line but the Hisense h9e plus is really really thin like ridiculously thin and it's too Harman Kardon speakers on the back got like a nice solid look like super minimal alright I'm done talking about it let's actually turn this thing on and see what 4k u le D looks like boom that was ridiculously fast I don't know if it's Android I can't tell if it's just the processor in here but it actually runs like an Android phone it runs really quick no lag at all let's check out what we got so much to check out here Google Play of movies and TV I just want to see how fast is team faster than I can even finish a sentence apparently this thing really really is fast the h9e is blowing my mind I am witnessing this just as you are witnessing this right now here we go this is so sweet so why I love the h9e just before daredevil gets started is because it's a 4k u LED panel and that's awesome because it's compatible with 4k Netflix shows like daredevil and chef's table and it just buffers like butter yeah this TV's definitely fast I mean there's no lag it's also internet-based ooh what there's $700 it looks this good and I'm up close to it you gotta keep that in mind I am like check it out the pixels here six point three million pixels on this TV and it looks sharp I only want more 4k shows to come out let me know in the comments if you guys have seen daredevil by the way this thing's insane fin good picture Android have keeps asking me dude where are the ports they're actually on the back and this TV has one port that I don't often see and it's an Ethernet jack so you literally can plug your TV in from your router no more messing around with the Wi-Fi that's going all over the place you're set just plug this bad boy in it also has 4 HDMI ports 2 that support 4k at 30 Hertz and then the other two are for kids 60 Hertz so you're set if you're a gamer and that's exactly what I'm gonna do next I'm gonna put 4 tonight on this bad boy and see how good it looks if it can handle it everything looks good and I got a new Xbox but before we do that let's actually watch some texmarq videos let's see what that these Harman Kardon speakers are because that's not something you get on every TV especially speakers like that dude it just it wakes up for you check out tech smart on YouTube [Music] I mean you see it I'm seeing it we're all seeing it here all right looking decent personally for me a nice Christmas happy we're bumping everyone in this video is by my sister mom and dad that is so loud alright let's check out another video it looks good I was just in Australia the speakers on this thing sound good the picture looks good H 90-plus actually is a low-key banger so Netflix is look good YouTube videos that look good what can't the high Suns h9e not take on so I'm throwing fortnight just to get some extra YouTube views here because let's just be honest that's why all tech guys play this wow it looks really good and I'm right up close to the h19 dang give me something come on let's go one feel what no really really man tech youtubers should just start playing pub G because apparently it's just not working out for us all right I'm going one more time TV sounds good I was thinking you know what I'm doing it I'm gonna just listen to the Harman Kardon speakers on the back blindfolded you guys saw when I didn't have my eyes closed I got killed so maybe this will work I'm better off blindfolded cuz I suck when my eyes are open like I'm gonna try to hear my way to a kill or a gun alright am i close to like any houses or anything like oh good am I like am i perpendicular alright I this is just not
