hey what's up guys welcome back to tech smart for a video you need to see whether you own a pair of ear pods or you just picked up the brand new ear pods Pro here are five tricks you need to know first this is one of the big new features on the air pods Pro there's actually software to see if they're fitting in your ear with the best seal or if you should try some of the included ear tips kind of cool right the only real thing about this test is you don't have to study so how you enable it is you go into settings and then you're going to scroll on down to bluetooth so many pairs of ear pods here I'm gonna go and throw the right one in the left one in and this is known as the ear tip fit test the et FP Wow how do I get a P in there e TF T ear tip fit test here we go and once you scroll down find your ear pods Pro you're gonna see this kind of menu and whether you've seen this or you haven't yet this is where all the good stuff is and then right down here is your tip fit test you're gonna hit that it basically it's gonna play a noise and be able to measure the depth of your ear canal and see how good beat your tip you chose I mean if it's not a good ear tip right you're gonna have to use the ones included luckily it says I have a good seal these are just a normal ones right out of the box if you didn't know with the air pods Pro there are included ear tips for the first time ever now if you lose them it's four dollars and I think you get six new ones don't quote me on that but make sure you get the right seal now for tip number two and it's how the air pods to have more of the touch control feature just by double tapping you enable Siri going back going forward on the song whatever you want to do and then on the air pods Pro you can just look at the form factor in comparison to the air pods too and see well there's this kind of groove here and when it's in your ear you put your index and thumb on the groove and by clicking that once you'll play pause twice going forward three times you go backwards you kind of get it I mean it's not anything revolutionary it's kind of like a button almost feels like there's a vibration but there's not it's like the old Apple iPod earbuds if you remember that same type of clicky feel the four sensors here the force is with us this is almost the best for last but don't worry there's two left tip and trick three is one apples calling a new feature on the earpods Pro called share audio and all you really have to do is well when ones in your ear and you swipe down on the control center and then you'll see a button that says share audio so that's the big deal all you need is another pair of ear pods that you have connected to the phone and it share audio open the air punch choose up you see the left one hit share audio that doesn't work if one day you just lose one of your ear pods don't worry you can well I don't know how long-term this is but there's now a solution or just every movie gets better with whomever you want to share with and maybe album listening parties so this one has to do with control center where you pull down and you can quickly access noise cancellation mode or transparency mode just by long pressing on where the volume would normally be if the air pods Pro weren't connected so you have your three options here right now nothing's on say that again oh wait can't even hear and right in the transparency mode I just like the customization and last but not least of course there's gonna be a bonus after this it's how to turn off noise cancellation with just hey Siri that's the biggest thing with air pods we've seen it since the start she's always listening I mean just right there I'm sorry I promise I'm not gonna say it I'll just refer to it as H s so you know turn on noise cancellation it's faster it's better than ever here we go the bonus so with it having noise cancellation transparency mode let's say you're jamming out to the new pinch song and you're in well noise cancellation and all of a sudden you got to get in the subway you want to actually talk to the pretty girl you're gonna hold down you can hear a little bit of the environment and then you really like her worth getting the number you're just gonna hold it and you can see it's off all with the force sensor just press and hold you'll cycle through the modes and what's really cool is Apple I really think is gonna start you improve what the Bluetooth settings look like I mean they might make you pay for it but here's the deal you can customize on the left or right if you don't ever use transparency mode you can just have it press and hold where it's just off noise cancellation it's truly customizable but also pretty limited and that's gonna do it for the five tricks on the earpods
