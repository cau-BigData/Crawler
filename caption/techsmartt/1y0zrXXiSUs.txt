Oh looks like it's six feet I think we're safe hey we've become a little distant hey what's up guys welcome back to tech smart for the first video in 2020 here on the channel I know it's been a while it's been around five months since opposed to the last video in December and there's a lot I gotta catch you up on but before this starts in that direction I want to take this video in a different direction I'm sure by now you know Koba 19 is a thing and since this is the first video of 2020 and I haven't said anything I just want to say this is a really scary and horrific time for all of us humans around the world wherever you are this is all impacted us some way somehow and this really would be a lot worse without the frontline medical professionals the day and night responders and everyone just putting their all in to make sure we are safer so I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart before this video starts and before 2020 starts thank you so much now I know it's been five months since there's been a video on this channel the last one was in December and to spend some stuff that's happened so I want to catch up so I got started on YouTube in 2007 some of you guys might or might not know this but this channel is not my first youtube channel and it took me a while to kind of figure out what I like to do what I didn't like to do if this was something I wanted to make videos about that's a big thing when texmarq finally got started in 2010 I was 13 years old and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my future but what I did know is I like technology and I like making videos a little bit more so blending those together techsmartt really started to gain a little bit of traction the more time I put into it and it started to become a truly full time thing and throughout the years I'm proud to say I've been able to meet some of those very people that inspired me to make youtube videos back when I was 13 years old at tech events phone launches and anything in between but over the last few years I have to be honest tech smart hasn't been as enjoyable have wanted it to be that's just the honest truth it's been this way for about two to three years and I take full responsibility for not letting you guys know sooner and truly taking some time off now first I want to caution you with not everything that you hear and see online social media at that is always true so for example there were some comments made that Twitter the social media platform actually deleted followers from the techsmartt Twitter account I wish this was true no so what happened was our engineering team found this website called manage flitter and what this website does is it identifies dead or inactive audiences followers on a Twitter account so when we ran this test and did their auditing diagnosis most of the followers were inactive there's been nine years worth of content giveaways and a whole lot of you guys have come and gone on Twitter and just really aren't engaging with the profile so we made the call as a team to go ahead and just remove anyone that was an active or wasn't actively engaging from this website and if you don't believe me well I understand the timing probably wasn't the best but check it out for yourself while there were a lot of things said I want to remind you to take everything you hear and see online with a grain of salt if you've ever built something before my co-founders and I have definitely experienced this before and our careers you must defend selfish actions against the greater responsibility that a company or organization provides for others we're very proud of the company that we've built over the last two years and its ability to employ some of the smartest and hardest-working people we know when one step further the opportunity to be able to offer the best products and services this industry has really seen before awhile to our partners and clients all around the world has really shown our game-changing difference I am so proud of GMG and what gas media has accomplished but most importantly wants to come now create a question Ketan this all went down in December it's been five months it's May 20 2008 even well to be honest I have never taken a break since creating texmarq nine years ago now I have been non-stop and I've never really expressed this before but over last three years I've been mentally and creatively drained think it's shown in the content specifically over a few videos that I can point to but by being able to just take time off and take a break I've been able to recharge my juices work on some other projects if you're gonna create a setting or have ever been it's really important but not everyone gets that time to recognize those moments and for me I completely been blind to it so getting to take the last five months off to completely recharge work a different part of my brain out it's it's been amazing and I really just feel stronger and ready to take on 20/20 and make just the best content with the best team I could have ever asked for since December GMG has grown tremendously in operations all the way from Asia to here in the US and last year GMG a large point really an exponential point in our growth curve where we had to take the time as an organization to understand what was ahead for us so you're probably wondering what happens next is there gonna be more of a break are you calling back on brain is this it no this is not it since starting techsmartt in 2010 it has been a dream come true and actually in December right as we were coming up on New Year's techsmartt turned nine-years-old and I didn't get a chance to officially say thank you this channel has changed my life has changed my future it's changed many other futures that I am so blessed to have come along the way for the journey and to think one channel could become an online media group of many channels that's just something I've always dreamed of but now that it's conceptualized it's really cool so I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart thank you for the last nine years of techsmartt and here's to nine years more so what does tech smarts specifically have planned for 2020 so I know this is crazy and this is gonna be a little fun and different but since there's been a lot of tech a little bit of tech that has come out since December think of the next few uploads more than a few as a time machine without the hot tub but add the people in we're gonna be checking out some of the stuff that you might have already seen on YouTube but looking at it in a different way so the 1+8 just came out iPhone se just came out iPad just came out there's a lot more that just came out I don't want to take the rest of this video with what just came out because you just gotta wait for the videos and on top of that there's gonna be new series too and what's even more exciting is I've always wanted to introduce new faces here on techsmartt so look at techsmartt is still the intersection of technology and entertainment that doesn't change but is more of the hub where over the next few uploads you're gonna see a few new faces and a few new series but overall that's just gonna bring more depth and really to show you a little bit more on what we've been working on let me know in the comments if there's anything that you've liked before and that you want to see a new season of but other than that there's a lot of surprises right around the corner that's really all I can tell you for now so thank you so much for sticking with it and hangin by this channel for the last five months I promise 2020s can it be extraordinary check out the links in the description if there's any other info you need and catch you guys in the next video forgot [Music]
