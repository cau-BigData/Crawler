yeah that's good guys welcome back to duck so far in this video is gonna be the hardest video I have ever made why because I'm gonna be trying to do a full ASMR iPhone 10 are a box is a bar I vote that are that's what really inspired this and I was thinking like let's just do something crazy something that is gonna be a challenge for me if you guys don't know or haven't been subscribed I have made loudest deck youtuber sometimes obnoxious sometimes over-exaggerated I am just crazy and we just finished them off there we go so I'm gonna try to really keep it mellow and a low-key and try to get through six iPhone 10 ours hmm that was great so yes we're doing with the proper ASMR boxing I got a few different things I want to show you guys so we got some triggers we have our first trigger if you make up brushes we just want to make sure my phone 10 hours are always clean that I have a brush for mascara I just bought these today I don't use a brush this one is good because you can really get into the Lightning port or dad though Jack oh wait and just really make sure everything's clean it does that's what you want when you're getting a new phone right this is the first day you guys are probably getting your phones and let me know in the comments if you guys are picking up a tenner Dennis or a 10-0 you're not picking up anything and definitely let me know if you guys want another day of smart video in the comments or maybe a new channel response don't know what's going on still check out some a as our YouTube videos it's margie be our darling it is our club channels here on YouTube but that do it is a way better than what I'm about to do this is a joke but a fun joke the white iPhone I got it these 64 Giga capacity I got all these except for one the yellow one that's gonna be my daily driver and I'm stoked easy so for 750 bucks you can get neat iPhone or a 6.1 inch Bowen honestly I think this might be the best phone of the year we all know is inside of every single iPhone box stickers paperwork if you need help never started this is all you need to look at don't even watching YouTube video so this is my first impressions with the iPod NR just right off the bat with the iPhone Denis Max and then the iPhone 10 are the 10 are feels heavier it obviously has a loop it up on the sides no I'd vote jack neither and I see a lot of iPhone 6's users there are too many iPhone 6s is in the wild if you have one let me know in the comments that I see this being what you might upgrade to if you had an iPhone 6s now it's time for everyone's favorite part well that's exactly what you're gonna be hearing more of let's put our iPhone 10 R to the side and see what else it saw a power cube that means earpods weekly included a lightning connector it's nothing new you guys know exactly what you're gonna see in the iPhone box the USB to lightning charging cable I don't know why it's not USB C yet it happily a lot of money on these accessories so that is the first iPod ten are fully a boxed I honestly don't mind the white color I'm really excited to see what this looks like in the blue or the yellow I personally I'm split on the blue and the yellow those on fire but I definitely want to know what you guys think so here it is the red denim interesting on the back is where it says product red usually I'll say on the side that's when you know you can buy too many product red products right I felt something I felt something and I'm doing the video here we go I like this already we have I don't know if you guys can see this but there's a little bit of dust on the screen protector I just don't know if I can even move on with life so let's just make sure we keep everything clean that looks so good it's like this nice cherry red okay maybe the red ones now my favorite Wow betting that red looks so good now let's check out this coral colors kind of like a red peach pink okay what's that it's the paper in the last box all right all right don't freak out we're still an ASMR mode gotta keep the composure this looks way better in person seeing this in YouTube videos or even on APIs commercial I like the color in person it is really refreshing it's really [Applause] I mean there you have it my first real impressions of the iPhone 10 are before I even turn it on so we're halfway through and I want to spice it up I want to make sure each iPhone XR boxing is different from the last so could be my favorite iPhone I just think it looks different you guys know it's the only one I got the 128 gigabyte model in so why the iPhone 10 re is so awesome is unlike the tennis or tennis max or any other iPhone I've seen before to get double the storage only costs you 50 bucks so 750 is what the intent are starts at but if you want to get the mid-tier model it's only eight honoured you gotta like that right so I want to try it out one of the triggers then I wanna see if we can on box this in a different way dude it smells like cereal smells like Lucky Charms see the rainbow taste the rainbow gotta keep it down it's really all about using the right brush to get all the dust off this eyelash brush I knew it was the right choice so now that it looks like the iPhone 10 are in yellow oh no way that is so [Music] because it's blue see if we can get this one from it's perfect we got the door you can finally walk it's way out of it Wow I was reading about this it's basically I wish I could do a as far as good as the rest so let's try to carefully burn this off we burned our iPhone 1000 you can see the ash on the side I mean it's got ip67 certification so it's waterproof up to one and a half meters up to 30 minutes Oh perfect I got just the right amount of solution and I fought to get it clean it's perfect it doesn't look I mean it's black every time so that happened I'm now back to my regular voice and as you guys can see right in front of me we have six iPhone 10 ARS all the colors and the reason I kind of picked up all of them I wanted to make this video was you're not gonna be able to see all these side by side unless you go to the Apple store and I gotta admit my top three are the blue yellow and coral with coral kind of being the biggest surprise I remember the coral iPhone 5c if you guys did shout out to you for being old but the iPhone 5c and coral or pink as most everyone calls it now it looked cool but it was kind of eye catching and I think what makes it even better is the glass back when it hits light it's game over and the aluminum on the sides kind of being like this nice pink that isn't rose gold or not the pink on the pixel 3xl but it's like actually a cooler pink I said pink probably more than I ever want to say in my lifetime and when you look at the aluminum on the iPhone 10 are I would say the one that looks the worst has to be the yellow it's kind of like this gold very similar but not to the iPhone 10s max I mean mine right here when you stack the gold up to it stainless steel versus aluminum I like the glass better than I think I like the aluminum but there's only so much analyzation you can do the blue looks great the white basically has silver aluminum on the side so that's kind of boring so really it's just the blue and the coral that I think with the best the product red is always gonna be the red the black so he's gonna be the black but the thing about the iPhone 10 are is you get options so you might as well pick one that is fun and a little bit different for 750 bucks you get 64 gigabytes of storage or as I said earlier in the for an extra 50 you get 128 gigabytes of storage so that's exactly what I did with the yellow one I got some stuff with it right because for 50 bucks more I'm now covered for the year all right let's turn all these on and get real first impressions coral I think this is gonna be the one I probably keep the blue one it's really about the colors which team are you on seriously let me know in the comments as we get all these powered up and set up now I gotta do this six times now that six iPhone 10 ours are fully set up I probably will not be buying six more phones ever again because that really was the same thing six different times so the first thing I have noticed with the iPhone 10 are over the iPhone 10s is the screen and that's the most notable difference so on the iPhone 10 are here the one on my right and has a 6.1 inch screen where the 10s max has a 6.5 inch screen so where things actually look different is the type of screen on the tennis max you have an OLED and then on the 10r it's an LCD and why does this matter well actually you're gonna get a better battery life in every review that I've seen has said the 10r has the best battery life out of any iPhone ever made so I want to put that to the test but the reason why you might be able to get better battery life is with OLED it can individually light every pixel which is why the screen looks better whereas with LCD there is just one backlight underneath all the pixels and you can't control them individually so it makes sense with one backlight needing to be controlled on the 10r wide you're gonna get better battery life versus controlling each individual run but that has been the first thing I can tell when you look at the 10 are next to the 10s it's not one of those things you would think makes a difference to the naked eye but once your eyes are both naked and you're looking at a 10s max side-by-side to a 10 R you can definitely tell the difference the second largest difference on the 10s and I said this in the ASMR bit is the build quality so the 10s versus 10 are there's steel on the 10s because you're paying more money and head on the 10 are to cut the costs have actually made it out of aluminium or aluminum and I don't mind it it was definitely one thing I was scared about because when you hold a ton of side by side to a 10 are you notice every difference in person you notice the weight the 10 are at least in my hands feels heavier it is thicker for sure even though it might not be thicker the aluminum kind of gives the impression that you can feel every side whereas a stainless steel it just kind of feels like one curved bone and that is really interesting being the note and not something I would have been able to find out unless I had both and when you look at the bezel on it there's a thicker bezel on the 10r and how this works is they actually taper the light on each individual RGB to kind of give that curved effect so the biggest question I have is how good is the aluminum versus the steel I guess a drop test is the only other way to find out we're gonna have to break them another thing that is different with the 10 are over the 10s or tennis max is camera so on the rear is a 12 megapixel single lens camera and that's the largest difference over the 10 R versus B tennis and tennis max you get two cameras like you did with the iPhone 10 on the back with one being that telephoto lens now here's where things actually get exciting and if you buy an iPhone 10 R you're getting almost a wider lens on the back whereas with the iPhone 10 s that second lens does that so why does this matter when you take a photo you're actually getting a wider shot because on the 10s it can do that with its second lens and when you guys see it or take a photo for yourself is kind of a bonus that I think is nice on the 10r that I wish the 10s had but it makes sense why it's not there and with the software since the portrait mode does look a little bit different if you want to do a selfie it doesn't work on animals so it's a no animal front facing camera with portrait mode so you're still getting the same stuff on the 10s and 10's max like portrait mode some software with a bigger battery and since its LCD technology instead of OLED it optimizes that a little better so you get better performance and that's ultimately what I'm seeing with the iPhone and are versus the 10s I'll probably do a big video figuring out which is the one to buy and 2018 because for 750 dollars this one starts at $1,100 you're getting a lot you're getting a phone with color which is just nice and refreshing I'm tired of seeing black gold and silver phones that's just boring you're getting aluminum what I feel is kind of like a thicker phone an interesting camera the same processor is the 10s and 10's max but and performance only three gigabytes of RAM so that's a big thing for you and you're opening up apps a lot you might be editing taking more photos really making this more of a pro device then I think the tennis the tennis Max is gonna be the right one for you but it's too early to call I got a really get in love with this iPhone 10 are put my sim into it and switch to it because I'm gonna see if the iPhone 10 are for 750 bucks is the phone to buy do you guys that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed the iPhone 10 R I think I said XR the entire video but it's iPhone 10 R I'm just putting that in there right now hope you guys enjoyed the ASMR bit because that was so much fun so different to try and it really is a challenge for me so if you
