showed up which is a record for wish let's just jump into it and see what's good so the first thing that I really want to check out is this drone I love drones well I sort of like drones I like groans when they actually fly and they work so this stroke might be one that I like the features that comes with is fixed high is that high altitude super 4 gigahertz connection head free supposed to be hands-free they're like getting everything wrong here one key return Wi-Fi supposedly HD okay what is this do I have to assemble okay maybe not maybe not they we're gonna make me build this thing from scratch this thing feels really cheap okay 80 bucks you get what you pay for it I can't be too upset I can never be upset in the wish videos this is Oh camera look at this camera is this the harness Oh prop guards the motor the battery is screwdriver let me set this up it's gonna be about a day but I'll be back I've been trying to get this drone set up I gave it a full charge this is where your micro SD card goes in so super easy to figure out where the camera is as well there's supposed to be an app I was checking out the bomb see it's called the Yui drone for 80 bucks I'm pretty eighty disappointed like there is nothing here that helps me figure out if there's an app how I see the video like check this out like are you gonna just take off if I throw you up I mean the good news is there's at least a screen so I can see what's going on I mean for 80 bucks it would have been cool your phone display was supposed to go right there so there has to be some app but I've looked can't find it don't bother okay this has got to be my favorite product in the video and we're only on number two it is the light up thumbs these were eight bucks so happy these showed up so real quick story time it was freshman year of high school I'd never been to a party my mom never wanted me to leave the house I guess that's why the YouTube channel did well listen I went to this party and I'm there and it's a typical high school party you know stuffs getting done people are having fun and this guy has these finger tips in like light-up gloves I couldn't tell if it was his thumbs or whatever but that's what inspired me to buy these light-up thumbs what is this they don't even light up these are just regular thumbs joshing you let me talk all this way dude this is such a good story okay well he never had fake thumbs I know he had all 10 fingers but basically this guy had these light-up gloves and they were tripping everyone out so that's why god I'm hopefully it'll trip you out here the lights whoa he's supposed to go in your thumb this guy had a way better set up like five years ago seems like technology's got worse or maybe I've got worse oh there's a look cool lever you tripping out you're tripping out ABS just going bananas back there someone get the kid some potassium and a nurse because the kid needs some help these are way better okay well alright let me put on all the thumbs first sooner the airport and they ask you for your fingerprint you just come up to them and you say hey man just trust me on this one I got lights and my fingers and they'll probably throw you out of the airport that's the first thing I'm thinking guys it's like the fingerprints on these honestly are you fooled it's kind of similar like my skin color does it somewhat look legit is it look real are you tripping out at the club like wow [Music] so I'm sure glad you guys are gamers let me know in the comments what you guys are playing right now I'm basically pub G in fortnight that's where my life spent for the last year so this is super helpful for ps4 my controllers were always dying I love these quick recharge stands seven bucks you see what I'm saying don't spend 50 if this actually works and charges if you will shock for controllers that is nice so micro USB port at the back to go ahead and charge your controllers and I'll leave links to everything this video down in the description if you want to pick it up this thing's looking like it's gonna be a win let's try it well this is really easy so just take your Dual Shock 4 line it up just like that it is charging you see that orange light back there that my friends is a $7 deal it's awesome so this is actually a free wish product I didn't order this that's why I was like what is this but it looks kind of cool so it is a pen holder as well as a wireless charger kinda cool for a desk I mean anything for free I'll take I did not pay for this at all you didn't see it in the first part of this video but it's this bamboo fast charging stand I mean anything that's free looks kind of good your pens and pencils go in here and your voice crack also goes right in there to load up your pens pencils okay so with 4 pens maybe a fifth pen 6 pen whoo this thing can hold a lot of pens get the charger portion going it's kind of simple that is a wirelessly charge yes it does I love them which sends you free stuff that works that's amazing I'll leave this link down below and the next video since you guys crushed it on the last one free wish video drop the like if you're excited if you'll be there I'm gonna order a bunch of free stuff I'm wish we're gonna see what scrap what's not what's popping what's flapping it's gonna be amazing not SmartWatch you guys know I love checking them out but some of them suck some of them have the same features so $30 let's see what we're getting on this one they're basically charging different prices I know what I'm getting myself into but this one has the camera at the top it looks like a home button auto watch ok turn this thing on I like to metal on the that is metal sometimes you have to give the old liquor route test looks nice kind of got this copper rose gold finish for 30 bucks kind of dig in this wrist strap it feels better than some of the others checked out a lot of smart watches so you can trust me never heard that before alright so you got your menu takes a SIM card which is kind of cool menu right message go back to the home button that is the home button I don't always see that on a watch the apps look real similar to some others this is a camera on here oh you know I'm taking a selfie oh it's well the cameras at the top so to take a selfie you kind of to flip your wrist around if that makes sense so I'll take it selfie of EV hang on you're looking good dude BAM and new tinder photo all right what else can you do on this watch a lot of these have similar features so if you've seen a SmartWatch here in the channel you see them basically all just watching a little wacky I thought I had to figure it out I don't so this is the go back button not the home button you Twitter on here that's sweet this watch has a lot more features than some of the other cheaper smartwatches but for 30 bucks it's tough it's a tough sell I've seen cheaper so I'm actually trying to start modeling soon that is not a joke so this is gonna come in really handy for me it's a fitness tracker maybe it works maybe it does it on the back let's see what some of the features are we got wireless syncing that's kind of rare for a wish product notification display caller ID display all the activity Auto sleep tracking alarms and heart rate monitoring for 20 bucks this thing has a lot of the stuff you find in like a hundred dollars Fitbit and then there's a second band twenty dollars please they're hooking it up okay it feels a little rickety oh wow that's awesome so to charge this thing up instead of it having a proprietary charger it has a USB that is curved I'm digging that so you just plug that into your computer you can always charge this thing that's sweet so I got the SmartWatch all charged up it looks so sweet like check out this display I was not expecting a display for 20 bucks especially on like a SmartWatch band from wish to be this good and I have an app that looks good but check out this app so you can see your device your profile obviously this is stuff you can go ahead and tweak but like it looks really and super well developed I'm just so blown away right now all right I'm a SmartWatch you a few different modes you've obviously your pedometer your beats per minute so if I put it on my wrist it should track it I have a rough idea of what my heart rate is I'm super hyper I haven't had caffeine today so it should be I say right around 80 to 100 beats per minute what if it tells me I have like a pulse of 25 beats per minute so it's drawing my pulse now we're doing no that's right your boy was definitely right 80 81 I nailed that Wow this app is awesome this watch is awesome there's a bunch of modes for 20 bucks definitely pick this up this thing is awesome so it cost me a dollar it's a phone magnifying glass so basically there is the stand portion at the back you line any smartphone up you have crop this up and when you look down or look through it it should make your phone screen bigger so I got all set up super easy you could just whip this in your backpack I'm gonna watch what's inside the World Cup soccer ball by what's inside I'm gonna check it out I'll leave a link down below Khan hard to see with the overhead cam but if you actually picked this up it's alright I mean it's a little janky you see it's this magnifying glass it works a lot better when you're looking at it like it looks natural you can see what's inside the soccer ball sick video dead it's basically a USB flash drive that looks like a bullet I don't know why you'd want this for eight bucks I think there are some more safe designs out there but it looks cool like oh wow that's real sharp honestly I figured it out so you're walking around you got this on your keychain yeah it's a flash drive no one knows it but it's also self defense [Music] the last thing is a big big big product why because it costs a dollar but it's more than that just trust me if you made this point of the video this is big because Josh's car does not work right now in Josh's car might have got a little hiccup on it it has a few scratches so this is a pink pen and for a dollar it's supposed to make Josh's car look like a Ferrari so let's head outside hopefully it works this is gonna be big for Josh this is Josh's Honda Accord it doesn't really work anymore you can see the paint that come on Ferrari come on how do you get the pain to come out you can just actually scratching this car more oh it's not a paint pen do Josh its nail polish wrong yo call the dealership Josh we got it for sale now you hear that thing ripoff dude yo we're going to the track tell Jeff Gordon he's got new competition yeah the paint pen if we had the right color this will look that bad but it basically smells like nail polish so
