someone once owned this so it's like you are going to a virtual Craigslist sale so we're gonna test this out fair warning I'm not super confident I don't think this is gonna work we're gonna play bangbros by little Dirk and then it just gets super quiet and it's at max volume doesn't work but the cool thing is these probably were in someone's house for ten years and now I'm in the house finally for box number four could have been box five if you showed up Cypress here we go so many action figures I don't have words we finally got boat gloves so as you the jury sorry I mean viewers saw with the spider-man didn't fit but the hull clubs do you ever throw some bows dude they'll call me Floyd money for nothing at all right let's see what else we got oh yeah yeah body well yeah that

iPhone case which I immediately wrote off doesn't look cool but it says Kendall and Kylie so this must have been the feminine box all right last thing that looks promising and cool is the laser axe real-life Laser gaming experience do you look at these kids these kids look tough they look like straight thugs and I want to be a thug so we'll see how to do this up to a hundred feet and range gosh they finally got me a blinky so I'm guessing this blinky would have worked but the thing is we only have three Triple A batteries and I'm guessing it might just be this one so I think it's safe to say
