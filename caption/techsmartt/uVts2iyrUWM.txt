hey with you guys welcome back to text mark for a very special video right now we're on the highway it's February 16th and Evan I missed our flight out of the local airport so we're going to LAX for the first air pods meet up in San Francisco Joyce a few months ago a few articles started popping up on some air pods meetups that's right people are getting together because of what's better to get together over a pair of air pods on a weekend so like everyone else that has nothing to do on a Saturday we're going to San Francisco for the first air pods Meetup you might be thinking yourself dude hold up slow your roll what do you mean first air pod to meetup plane route 1 to 4 did a video on this and that's right I'll leave his link down below he's an awesome dude but he went to an air pad to meet up at the Grove here in Los Angeles and it was raining you know there's been tons of rain here in California and only a few people showed up so I'm not gonna really consider that a meet-up that's more of like an air pods Wow Wow you catch me so we're going to San Francisco where all the tech guys are we're air pods were made and we're gonna find out aren't are gonna be more than like three people [Music] [Music] Edna San Francisco I actually think this will make it this time so we're bringing the really cheap I 1010 ws pair you know they look like air pods and they have wireless charging built into the case bringing the $159 air pods what all the rich people think they have but to flex on them I'm gonna show everyone at the airport's made up the 995 dollar Louie Vuitton horizon if you guys missed the video it's right up there in the iCard f you ready we're on our way to San Francisco finally have are you excited how was your experience today it was that good I am so pumped hopefully there's some people that show up because what if there isn't what if it's just you and me and that's another Wow all right let's go [Music] we just landed here's the crazy part the event starts at 2:00 p.m. it's 1:57 so the big reason why this matters is that every other air pod speed up basically the first minute that people don't see anyone there they leave oh we need to be there ASAP and it didn't help that I miss the flight this morning cuz I overslept I'm sorry we're doing about you guys I remember I asked you on the YouTube community both makes you get subscribe so you see it over 36,000 of you voted for us to be in San Francisco so this fails is on you guys hopefully it doesn't have so like what do you expect for you that do you think people are gonna be there do you think this is just a waste he was a meme on Facebook that someone turned into a real event and that 6,000 people said they would be at or you think they're just trying to you think the tech smart fans are just trying to make a meme out of me it's 3/16 right now and I think it's safe to say there is not six to eight thousand people here seems like people are having a nice Saturday I think two people wearing air pods I'm a little down if you can't tell you know what's going on right now I'm really disappointed there was nothing cooler than doing a tech smart show-and-tell like that's that's all your boy wanted to do here even flew up for it so we're gonna go find some things to do there's a Louie Vuitton store across the street let's see if we can get a second pair or two even half you just got out of the Apple store I had to pick up a fresh pair [Music] is yeah I just couldn't use that broker thank you friend so we just got another Luigi store no joke the woman who works there at security are these ours not even Louis VIII thinks I it it like I don't want these anymore I want to go back to the fake the $4 pair [Music] we're finally back in LA here's the conclusion on this video so going to San Francisco I was thinking you know since that's where the tech is Cupertino it's up there that at least some people would be showing up to speed up so I jumped on the carpe diem which is basically like an events page and it said 1,700 people were going so I don't know where I got six to eight thousand I think where I got confused is I saw a bunch of invites on Facebook that's originally where this idea came from and then like BuzzFeed did an article titled 21 of the most only in LA things to ever have happens like what do you mean has happened have happened there was an air pods powwow at the Grove and if you don't live in LA that's just a mall where there's a big Apple Store you can see Saturday February 2nd for three hours at 9:00 p.m. will 12 a.m. is that even safe that just sounds like someone's up to no good so from there going into Facebook you got some hope now and this is where the video takes a turn and if you made it to this point drop a like on this video if you want me to go to also Norway there are allegedly allegedly allegedly there are 7,000 people going to the air pods owners meet up in also four point five thousand people are interested two point three thousand are going F I mean from today I know dude I know 1700 people showed up at Union Square what really happened was it was just us and ourselves we got to play with our own air pods we even went to Louie Vuitton they call security on us because they didn't believe we had these so that was something you didn't expect today that was something I did not expect by waking up this morning or going into Apple to basically buy pair 37 so that's it for this video if you guys are new make sure to drop a like info on Instagram it's just tech smart that's where all the behind the scenes were if you guys didn't know make sure you get subscribed and consider joy to become a member it's super cheap tons of extra perks I'll catch you guys next time
