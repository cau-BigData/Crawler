high-risk you guys welcome back to tech smart for another video this one was kind of inspired by my dad he's a big ear pods guy kind of jumped on board a little way you guys know these have been out since the end of 2016 so coming up on just over two years now and that means when everyone has them but you've obviously been subscribed and you've seen tons of videos on these so in this video I'm gonna be showing you three tricks on air pods you never knew existed roll the intro really well for you guys and you have not lost your ear pods and if you have welcome to the club this is not even my own pair I've lost 35 pairs to date since December of 2016 so rest in peace and drop a like if you guys have air pockets I'm just trying to figure out who has them and who doesn't have sorry I don't speak broke so in this video three tricks that you never knew about on air pods and two of them are basically well they're ear tips and this is where things get spicy my dad actually told me these work and he knows what it means to make a tech smart video game here so I'm with my dad so if it's not a hack you guys know my dad ain't coming back so you guys be the judge in the comments if you guys like what my dad kind of put in this video and let's just get started and before I show you guys if you guys missed the $4 ear pods how bad is it basically where I compared a free pair you can get on wish to the hundred and seventy dollar pairs well they're technically air pods right yeah you guys know sets up there in the iCard or link down below and links to everything this video will be down below if you guys want to pick it up basically all these are really inexpensive and kind of worth it so the first one is this is just crazy my dad told me about these their ear tips that fit perfectly on the air pods and you're probably saying Keaton you also have a pair that clearly don't fit on the air pods I mean you know there's a case on it just look at these these hooks just that just doesn't work and that's what I thought but basically for eight bucks I don't know how much these go links in the description eight bucks you get four pairs so if you have four people in your house with air pods these come down to two dollars each so this is what's sweet you take your regular air pods that you have and then you basically need to spend five minutes trying to install he's like your tip parts if that makes sense it's like in ear it's an ear hug it's almost like a cozy dude like can we call it a cozy EV but that was pretty easy man the one that he had well nope that's basically the one he had they just kept coming off they're really hard to install but once you get them if you like them or let's just say the air pods keep falling out of your ears whether you're running that was my dad's problem at the gym so this fixed it for them and they're fully compatible with the air pods case so you don't need to take these off you basically set it and forget it so the easiest way to get them on is start with the earpiece and then just kind of pull back and then just finesse there with your nails so just like that they're both installed and you have three other pairs left so I'm sure one of the colors is you and when you put them in your ears it's nearly impossible to shake these things out 100% and that's kind of the other pair here too if you guys didn't know about these these fit perfectly in the air pods case no joke it's a little difficult but you can just slide the rubber around to get it perfectly does this work these are your ear pods I'm leaving these skins on your air pods or the cozies and if you don't like these and you need something a little bit more substantial because you just got big honkin ears well you can now just rock and roll with the ear hooks they're not perfect for an air pods case you really have to jam them in and I don't necessarily like how loose they are that's just weird you really just gotta line them up perfectly I mean who's got time to take them on do that I mean not all that bad but yeah I mean holds the air pods in virtually impossible to shake out not bad I mean you probably didn't know you could get cozies and they also fit in your air pots I almost have that do you think the big fake ear pods work with these no way if your ear holes are just this big I think there's something else there you might want to get yourself checked out but like no no joke like this works dude it doesn't fit it barely fits and it's cuz the hook is going right up in there these things are huge both fit with basically any ear pod air pod or even fare pod so the next trick I know for sure you had no idea about because it's actually on your iPhone and it's basically the craziest thing I could ever describe it's a weird feeling for sure it's definitely weird to hear yourself talk so that's a feature there's an always listening feature where you want cut all your music just throw these in so no one actually thinks you're listening to something and then you can still hear the outside world that now exists so how you do this is you go into settings go into control center and this is actually how you add more widgets if you want to check some of these out here's what I'm rocking right now and then basically you want to go and add hearing so it's got the ear you can see it it's blue so when I swipe down I have this little ear from my drop-down when I tap this it pops up something interesting I have never seen before in the air pods menu until now and I'm sure you're saying this to let me know in the comments if you've honestly seen this before and why you didn't let me know on Twitter that's how I had to find out just tech smart let's check this out live listen and now you can hear yourself yeah it exists you can become a spy or if there's a lot of people around you you look like you're on a meeting talking with the big client just kidding you're eavesdropping that now exists so that's just something else kind of cool that I really enjoy and I never knew existed on air pods and then really where things get super spicy is in the last trick you guys might have heard but apples working on air power yeah you probably heard about it basically maybe coming out we don't even know and that's from the guys that actually know that's how maybe this product is I know Apple watches the channel maybe bring it out because that would be cool because with air pods the one limitation is you need to charge them with a lightning port and kind of in the future we're going to a world of wireless charging so a wireless charging Apple case would be sweet right your iPhone 10s max boom you know this thing's expensive you ten are lieutenant whatever you have Yoona fits the iPhone 10 those have wireless charging if you kinda just want to live a minimalist life your air pods should wireless the charge - oh wait EV we did a video it's right up there in the iCard this is kind of like an older product but for 40 bucks it's not a bad solution and you can see the Lightning port right down there so you just line up your ear pods make sure connects just like that you have your air pods in a case so they stay protected it's also silicone so you know when it's going in your pocket and wow just like that the first pair of air pods you bought is the last pair you bought because you still have them I knew I was in for it the minute I bought enough I knew I'd be ten pairs deep in a month so this is what it looks like and what sweet is ear pods docking perfectly oh you can even sneak one of the cozies in there too and it's kind of one of those things that's hard to see but this wireless chargers plugged in the boom you can see my tennis max is charging and then here's where the coil is when the light turns on that means something was recognized on the wireless charger that's why I have this one for this type of stuff and you can see your pods are charging so you get a few of these or you have a mat like air power that's why we need it you then can just drop your phone and drop your ear pods really just grab your keys and if your wallets on your phone I mean then you're just a robot you don't need to do anything else and that's gonna when I realized these three tricks we're perfect for you guys so if you guys hear about anything else that's earpods related
