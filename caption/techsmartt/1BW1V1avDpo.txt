thank you guys welcome back to tech smart and things got really spicy this week so most you guys probably saw Apple released three new phones on Wednesday and I wanted to take a few days just to kind of process it and really kind of make a big decision but if you saw the live should be dead if you guys missed that it's right up there in the iCard tons of fun a lot of you guys actually called it in and folks you were pretty chill so thank you guys for being a part of that but they released one phone at this event that really blew me away I kind of knew about it and it's the iPhone XR and I'm sure you guys heard about it too let me know in the comments what you guys think about it throughout the video because it's the one phone I think Apple has really made that hasn't been a flagship that I really want and I can't wait for it so the four announcements they had the XS the XS max the iPhone XR which this videos on and then the Apple watch series for it and I love the Apple watch series for I can't wait for that to come out but I was really shocked not to like the XS max as much as I was hoping to or even the XS I kind of think they're good phones but it's the S year you know it's not gonna be huge breakthroughs more just refreshes and updates but the XR is a brand new phone this year with a brand new price and brand new specs and I think that's why I think it's the coolest thing out there and seriously bowed up in the iCard what you guys think about the XR and if you guys care about it or even gonna pick it up I think this could be the real winner of this year and it might be interesting to see especially with how Apple does if more people pick up the cheaper phone that honestly has the best specs and it feels like a steal right now over the XS or the XS max and the coolest part about this one is it comes in colors so the iPhone XR is huge it starts at 750 bucks for a 64 gigabyte model and what's sweet is with what actually isn't sweet is this is just a fake it's a clone it just meant for representation it's gonna look particularly exactly like this and you can see that big honking camera Ridge right there that's good to be real interesting but the XR is really sweet because it finally comes in colors kind of like the iPhone 5c and I think Apple finally the difference between a cheap phone and a really good phone that others really wanna get that has a little less like specs and that's where this iPhone XR gets super interesting so I'm gonna flip it over but don't cringe too hard cuz this isn't the real dealer obviously what you're getting at the store it is a 6.1 inch LCD screen as rumored and what's interesting is Apple's calling it a liquid Retina display which I'm all about and I really want to test out because if they can sell a phone at $750 that looks just as good as the XS max this one starts at 1100 or even the XS starting at a thousand similar to the iPhone 10 last year I think this could be groundbreaking and a new start to Apple what really caught me by surprise is the iPhone XR has the same specs for the most part is the iPhone access max and the new iPhone XS that's kind of crazy so Apple put the new 812 Bionic chip in all three phones this year you'd think they might put the a 11 make it more budget-friendly maybe even drop the price no no it's got that neural engine to all three phones really have updated AI of course the new XR has face ID and that was one of the most exciting things I heard this new chip the a12 Bionic has an updated neural engine and that's what allows face ID to even exist and that's why we saw it last year so by Apple updating this and just talking about face ID they finally hopefully solve the biggest problem I hated about my iPhone 10 face ID sucks I really hope this year it got way better and is more accurate than ever because I would rather have a home oh and another thing that's so sweet is the battery life I think is actually gonna be really good and actually better than the iPhone tens battery life so Apple didn't say at the conference if this phone's battery life is better than the iPhone X or iPhone 10 but what they did say is it has 90 minutes more battery life than an iPhone 8 plus which has a 5.5 inch screen I'm really hoping that this phone is the real winner and has insane battery life and it's just the longshot no one knew because it's stacking up to be good so another huge difference on the iPhone XR compared to the XS line is the camera so on the back is a 12 megapixel camera and that's the same on all three phones this year the only difference is on the XS you're gonna get 2 on the XR you're only gonna get one but what was kind of crazy is as they were talking about cameras this a 12 chip comes with the same tech is the flagship phones from Apple the more expensive ones so what's interesting is photos are probably gonna look just as good on the XR as compared to the XS and it's because of the chip it has a smart HDR which basically takes multiple photos stitches them together and produces the best and one thing that I don't know and I kind of wanted to see this but we're gonna have to get one in October to find this out is this camera bump it almost looks and I don't know if you guys felt this too that it's it almost looks like it's double the thickness then the iPhone tends camera and I know we were trying to get away from bumps but I think they're trying to bring it back and my only concern is and this is not the right phone to test this on is if it's gonna wobble and everyone that's talking about the iPhone XR has said it feels really good the ones that were at the event so for colors it comes in orange black blue coral red and yellow so no green this time around if you'd like to color green the 5c look really good in green it's like a nice mint I'm just really excited about this another change they actually made a difference to is it's no stainless steel on the sides it's actually aluminum so that's obvious cost more money to make stainless steel phones and they actually cut 3d touch which I didn't really know about for the XR but there's still that haptic feedback so if you're on your lock screen and you see the camera icon in the lower right corner you can press on it and hold into it it'll open it up so it's kind of there but it's not like what you'd see on the iPhone 10 or any of the other more expensive and honestly after seeing all three phones come out today and all kind of having pretty similar stuff for the most part it's also really interesting it's the most durable glass ever on an iPhone so I really want to test that out and see which phone is honestly the best for the moon 750 bucks is what it starts at for 64 gigabytes if you want to get the 128 gigabyte model it's only 50 bucks more so that's probably the one everyone's gonna jump towards if you want to get the 256 it's an extra 100 bucks so $900 but for an extra $50 you're basically getting a full-on phone enough storage to last you a year or two and that's kind of big so I guess we're gonna have to wait till October 26 when these things are on sale really excited I just don't know how to contain myself because I kind of feel the magic and Apple again and it's weird cuz it's not at the price I thought so that's it for this video I'm so shocked I can't wait for the iPhone XR if you guys are new make
