and finally it showed up body got stolen my $53,000 MacPro that basically costs an entire year of university don't eat it if you guys see Mac Pro was last refreshed in late 2013 and since then we have not had a Mac Pro this came out earlier in the summer and we didn't know if we'd actually get it in 2019 this is the shot I just ripped my jeans jeez I'm not I don't really care about it because at $53,000 we're really worried about a pants so you're probably asking yourself what spec did you get on your Mac Pro what's the actual price how much did you pay in tax retail is 49 9 9999 so basically $50,000 and then I got the 32 terabyte Pegasus our 4i raid enough shut up let's unbox and now you could be thinking all right it's not too late to go back USC Emerson College or a dual motor all-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 got two velcro kind of like pull taps this is now my second electric vehicle doesn't have petroleum might do an engine mods swap but we're putting wheels on this and if you did order wheels on your Mac Pro right when these drops you'd be wait until next year so to prevent that we chose to not get the peels added on but what else comes in the box you got your accessories keyboard oh these app we don't rip anything that power cable here seems it seems to be it the same way even if you get the baseline one but basically it for an unboxing you might have seen a little early we didn't see it effects my way let's take off its winter apparel it's got a nice Canada Goose on hi buddy yeah it's cold and jam feeling we're feeling the holes wow this I just I want to take the top or inside up so how you actually open up the mac pro unlike the 2013 model where you actually lifted the lid and pulled just straight up there's actually a hinge right there the most exciting part of a purchase like this spec time so I got the 28 core Intel xenon W 1.5 terabytes of ddr4 Ram a hundred and twenty eight gigabyte Radeon video card that is - 64 gigabyte cards and finally a 2 terabyte SSD hard drive so the things that I didn't upgrade for this $50,000 beast was a more expansive SSD at time of order it was only 4 terabytes offered and because you know apples not always consistent now it's 8 terabytes exactly like the 2019 16 inch MacBook Pro and then the afterburner I'm more of a prima loan than a post Malone so just kind of want to skip out on the afterburner but here's the thing that really just grinds my gears so I had an MX black card and I heard about Apple offering six percent cash back I'm any purchase so for this holiday season I was thinking aren't six percent cashback on something like this that's that's actually some money but instead Apple's own Apple card doesn't even allow a spending threshold to buy out really virtually a maxed out Mac Pro and that kind of sucks so we got the points but like really you can buy the most expensive thing with the own product one of the cool things about the Mac Pro is the kind of offset aluminum to black unibody for all the accessories so that's it the new USBC 2 lightning cable and then of course your hefty kind of ropes power cable for two USB seaports and the power button on the back magic is got your full IO so right here you have four Thunderbolt 3 USB ports then you got another four here two HDMI 2 USB 3 that seems ah that seems really odd wish they would add more and then another 2 USB sees don't know if those were Thunderbolts would imagine so I'm gonna headphone jack power button time so this monitor here I'll power it on it was the best that I could afford but it's got heart and that's all that matters so while the mac pro powers on we all seen what Mac OS looks like Mike OS Catalina this is not new but what is new is the 32 terabyte raid this is really interesting because the whole kind of controversy is Apple is basically building a Mac Pro that can't be used with every accessory that it sells and that's ok their accessories but with this in particular if you were to install it with the two video cards that we have and how much space that takes up this doesn't fit this is like a library book so this is gonna fit but it's not gonna fit because the second half of this card has nowhere to plug into so controversy or not I mean Apple didn't make it so every would buy this but I bought it I saw it I thought it was really cool and it's gonna serve a whole lot of use for actually being a server so like text marks got a server now so that's gonna do it for the most expensive unboxing here on texmarq if you guys made it to the end please drop a like I'm gonna need it a little secret between us we laid away this purchase so that's that's all that really matters make sure you get subscribed and I'll catch you guys and
