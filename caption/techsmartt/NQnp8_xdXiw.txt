this is so awesome the maneuverability just right off the bat is not that hard it was good guys welcome back to techsmartt and I have one thing to ask and I want you guys to answer this in the comments is what I'm about to show you the future because I think it is the closest thing we have come yet let me give you guys some backstories so inside this white box is a product you have never seen before something that I've honestly never seen before we're about to find out together this is made by Segway and said well you guys know they had the big old rideable thing with the handlebars then they actually acquired this company called nain bot and that was the thing I showed you guys like a few years ago it's up in the iCard if you missed it that was like the best hoverboard yet it didn't catch on fire and had this bar so you could kind of pivot make sharper turns now today they have completely killed both ideas and made something that solves both problems we're about to see it this is the future and I am so pumped to try this out just you can feel the excitement is so real inside this box or what I'm gonna call the next-level rocket shoes these literally feel like rocket shoes and I haven't either rid them yet I'm just holding it I do not even know what to expect and then of course there's a charger to charge these things up they have two ends for one charge port that means both rocket shoes can charge at the same time that is a really nice inclusion thank you so much Segway that's not always the case so you guys are looking at this just like me for the first time and you're probably like am I just going to eat pavement I wasn't saying pavement you know what I wanted to say but are you just gonna fall and this is just gonna be an emergency trip as fast as it can possibly be what's up guys boyacky here and no and here's why on the bottom you guys can see there are these two large almost one wheel type things you might have seen the one wheel it's be rideable I love it to death these are basically two one wheels and one on each foot so you're getting I'm not saying improve stability but the best you could possibly get in something that also has straps you can carry this around it makes a whole lot of sense compared to some of the others out there I might as well just power these on so there's a power button on the side right here turns on and you get a light on each they're self-balancing almost shoes but as you can tell the differences with a hoverboard there's no guardrails there's nothing to put your foot up against so it's really coming down to this rubber and depending on how thick and rigid it is out in the real world what in test it that's gonna be make-or-break so these should be the coolest thing you've ever check out if you go to the roller derby or the roller rink I know it's not the 1980s but you'd be the hottest thing in town so the only love to do is let's test out riding these things and see what some other people think let's go to Venice Beach we made it to Venice Beach and we're about to try out the drift W ones for the first time and I had this gonna crazy idea if it is twenty five thousand likes I'm gonna reach out to Segway the whole team is and let's try to do a massive giveaway of these hey you never know it's possible to drop a like 25k maybe things will happen and I'm just gonna keep calling them the drifts for the rest of this video we got the first drift set up second ones all set up step on this and see what it's like this is so awesome the maneuverability just right off the bat is not that hard initial impressions on these is the only thing you have to watch out for is when your knees go like that then you have to really recenter it five minutes I would say obviously did not expect that first time going up a hill I can do it a little help very little so you might be asking is there a dedicated left in a right shoe no you just power them on put them on your feet and it doesn't really matter one thing I will say after riding these for about thirty minutes is going over bumps is the scariest thing ever there's no suspension it was one thing nice about the hoverboard so I would say it's a little harder to learn this then a regular hoverboard but like you saw some guy just drive it for five minutes more people are trying it they get it much quicker than they think they will and I think that's just where the confidence comes into play Josh dude these are so much fun and I don't know if you guys can tell but I really like the W ones I think they're cool deftly something to check out if you guys are new make sure you subscribe so you don't miss anything coming up the special you can pull off this giveaway check out bless you videos right over here and I'll see you guys next time please
