total for this video was 230 dollars got a few deals in there I can't believe it so drop a like if you guys want that hand to happen I'm gonna order this I'll let you guys know how long it takes that's the whole thing with where am i right hopefully it all shows up let's do this to talk about weeks but everything and some bonuses actually showed up so we only ordered five items but as you guys can see there are six items here so wish actually threw it in well check that out at the end so the first thing I want to see is this dual channel microphone some static at a distance I remember what you get two microphones that's sweet okay looks sort of promise is up I think I'm secretly in love my only thought is it does need a speaker table so I'm not getting a speaker I know you mix tapes about a drop yeah I'm Keaton here check-check yo pop hot diggity begin to pop pop check check check it out what what's it all about it's I'm gonna say it works so for item number two I don't remember what this was but really only one way to find out right you guys don't you got anything is video I'll leave a link down below by the way what time order some massager I have no idea oh the vacuum oh god this thing it looks like it's a champion already what is that that is nice soft I won't be cleaning your carpet anytime soon fabric cookie monster movie eww stuff on your floor see this works you're kidding me do you think it will get out cheap like what over-under right now will it get out so some dirts been laid down [Music] maybe we're going dog your no you haven't done a thing you've just moved the dirt the dirts over here nice job winner so I think this thing is not actually a vacuum but it's just more like a mop or a duster to keep the house nice into a one a little disappointed does not I got dirt everywhere I guess that's why we do this so you know you don't lose 17 bucks so for item three it's a Smart Watch always curious to check these out or to Android and iOS all right looks kind of decent I mean they're all pretty much the same at just different prices right kind of nice has a camera right at the top kinda looks like one of the Samsung gear watches can't be that can't be that at all so here it is the $15 SmartWatch and see what it's got bluetooth blue dialer messaging you can put a sim card in here and it will work pedometer and it's saying only four steps what else find me that's kind of cool of course we can work the camera on here that's BAM that's a nice sneak shot I can see you Facebook's on here of course Facebook's on here they're everywhere Twitter whatsapp man this thing's got everything definitely open I don't for is not interesting it's not a spy cam that I first checked out at the beginning portion of this video what's up with this so mini USB to charge looks super delicate has Wi-Fi and an app where could you put this anywhere so this is what it looks like you have your battery Wi-Fi module and then your camera right there Wow put this on a car what are these caps you say camera caps my caps feel to get actual spire I know I go work for the US government awesome so you could just hot glue this cap on that's so sick so like this it looks like a screw well unfortunately the white box didn't work I'm gonna try to find it better spy cam just trust me on that so for item five it's that hammock that air hammock this looked awesome reviews were amazing Oh what good why'd you have to fill this with air run around fill this with air and that's how it gets inflated it's like a tart literally as a tarp alright so here in this film up was comma struggle I don't want a highway to do this luxury Dodd so luxurious maybe on a beach but this thing can't hold anything and lasted this isn't something we ordered or asked for but I think wish knows I'm a big spender and threw in a speaker maybe was to compensate from the broken spycam I don't know who sent this it just showed up so let's try this out this thing looks like it's been through a war gonna USB port it's just mangled it's so like crappy I almost want to break it what's up what's inside beers Keaton here sup Dan and Lincoln basically did this one for you it's a crappy speaker I know why they probably threw it in no one ordered it so you guys that's gonna do for episode two of wish Buster's makes you drop a like if we hit 30,000 likes make sure
