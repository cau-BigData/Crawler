hey whiskey guys welcome back to tech smart and it's been a while since I've checked out a brand new celebrity product you guys can check out the playlist it's right up there Rihanna's made some headphones Beyonce's made some headphones Pizza Hut they're a celebrity they've made some shoes and some headphones so today it gets a little different he's now stepping up to the plate Dwayne the rock Johnson has come up with a pair of headphones with Under Armour and they also done Stefan Curry's shoes I kind of dug those this small that was what was cooking hopefully he's cooking up some fire these costs two hundred and forty nine bucks at retail they just came out last week you think of the rocker Dwayne Johnson you don't really think of headphones products too much you think of the guy getting jacked working out and cooking up stuff in the kitchen so he was dropping these headphones I did a little research this is actually gonna get cut with the rock that I found outside we're so close yeah I did a little research I don't want to see what the inspiration was for the rock Wireless is and I'll just let him explain no one was making a product specifically for people in the gym who go hardcore you'd sweatin these four workouts later you got to throw them away because the headphones would start to stink you've dropped them on the floor like that they would break these are gonna be the most durable the most functional highest-quality sound from JBL whoo I've rocked with for years like Dwayne that just doesn't simply happen you don't just drop a pair of headphones at the gym and they shatter into a million pieces maybe the ones you do cuz you're just jacked and I wish my headphones are shattering as much as you say they do so here they are let's open these up Oh what did we just get is this a cow a rhino the two rocks I found outside Wow okay so you get a nice carrying case for 250 bucks I hope you would open these up okay so we get some accessories just pull this out you get a 3.5 aux cord micro USB to recharge a manual you don't really care about that these things are wireless after all you're gonna charge them at night so let's see what's up Wow these are definitely more durable than they looked in the pictures we had this etched and kind of rigid not rubber that's plastic the calf logo it's actually a ball I mean he's a Brahma bull at the end of the day some fake screws I mean I'm not here to knock the man I'm just here to let you know what's up with these and if they're worth your time and then some on ear ear cushions with some perforated cups so in theory you drop these on your head shouldn't sweat that much they feel heavy for sure so on the side we have our power on volume up volume down they're just sticking out they're not in where you got a fumble around at the gym after all these are meant for the gym exclusively for the gym that's who his market is for this all right first impressions on the head how do we feel do we feel stronger weaker or we want to go to the gym there's only three options they got this heavy weight to them it's through this rigid plastic your size a whole lot of metal on here outside of the band adjustable headband of course at the top you know what it's gonna say blood sweat respect that's his mantra can you put a bulletproof vest on because I got some guns here at so let's go and give you the world round bowl blast me with something here we go so I'm listen to the PBJs pose i'll leave a link down below it's my new playlist i keep updated every week on spotify might do an apple music you guys want that drop a like for use and Spotify or Apple music so I know and let's give us a shot we're gonna do a guest Drake's scorpion bow there's some love put into these the bass I would say is very similar to the beats bass there's not even this much bass in the talk up song super clear vocals I'm not really hate not if so mmm all right let's try out another song let's see Xylo don't panic ooh that alright more of like a pop tropical house upbeat song yeah the vocals sound good like I can hear so that's always good and the sound isn't leaking a whole lot met max volume let's pause it up here and let's get real so these are 250 bucks I check it a pair on wish you missed that video I'll leave it right up there in the iCard these are the beats threes they have a chord so they're not Wireless with Bluetooth but these were 51 bucks so if you want a cheap pair of headphones maybe this is something you guys should check out I kind of dig these just because of how rugged they are where these really set themselves apart is a fact that they're inspired and endorsed by Dwayne Johnson the guy that's like wow I love fitness so much I'm willing to make my arm larger than my hand we're gonna actually try to work out see if these things are destructible or in destructive well I'm gonna try to work out see if I feel it I mean I might as well just might as well pull him out here have the biggest thing I wanna put to the test is Dwayne's claim every pair of headphones when he takes him to the gym and you drop them they just shatter so let's drop these things and see if it shatter like this isn't rocket science like you know this if the headphones made out of metal yeah the cups are just gonna fold in you're gonna be fine it's only if you're dropping it off like a 30-story building or trying to snap these things apart all right I mean I are I did it once well that is it I hear I'm hearing some creaking I don't think you're doing that a whole lot but I think the only thing left to do is bump some tunes let's run around let's see if we can shake these things off one two if they can break with my insanely jacked workout and three if they're worth 250 because I'm kind of mix right now here we go all right we're trying to run in place let's see if we can get this going get the workout gear on I don't think it worked out this part of the channel before yo check how's my form let me know in the comments how good my form is probably awful so if you're at the gym this is kind of handy and let's say your spotter wants to be like yo your weakest crap bro you can hear them by just tapping this and then it amplifies the atmosphere so pick up some more weights bro I mean you can now have those conversations and well I'm the weak one I'm panting after doing what was a minute of working out the only way is up blood sweat and disrespect that's been everything till now all right I got one clapper in can you not like show them that I wasn't able to do a ton of push-ups like only put like the two good ones I got in there so here's the deal with these rock headphones you guys gotta let me know in the comments how you're feeling I'm kind of torn so for 250 bucks these are the most rigid and most durable headphones I have ever tried out there definitely meant for the gym but to be honest those $51 beats I got in that wish video that's what I'm taking to the gym now just because if I break them into whatever I can grab another pair I might be out of breath but that's it for this video if you guys enjoyed it make sure you get subscribed click that button right there check out the other two videos after this I'll see you guys later rock on
