welcome back to another episode of what's in the mystery box basically if you guys are new here and you haven't seen episode 1 I'll leave it link right up in the iCard check that out right after this video ends but there's this thing called mystery boxes on the internet I'm sure you guys have heard of it before you basically spend money and hope you don't get absolute crap in the last video we actually got some dope stuff we got a Google home ad from $100 box and then the $250 box they actually sent us to Samsung Galaxy Note 4 so what is this yo what is this a bouncy ball some headphones with tinfoil on the side I get why it's a $15.00 mystery box like I can't even get mad so I'm pretty optimistic and I'm gonna keep this series go and drop a like if you guys want me to keep it going so we're gonna fire up eBay and see which three mystery boxes we find at which prices and just see if they're legit let's fire a bay up and see what's good so I got three mystery boxes that I'm watching just so we can make this easier the first box that I want to kind of pick up and has caught my eye a little bit is a $40 mystery box so in the last video we checked out a $15 $100 and a $250 mystery box you guys probably have seen it by now this video we're gonna kind of switch it up it's actually getting really hard to find mystery box on eBay eBay is banning them and in the last video they actually took one of the boxes listings down after I bought it that makes sense you guys picking up what I'm putting down so we're gonna try to grab these and hopefully eBay doesn't pull them so the first box is a $40 box it says it's a mystery electronics surprise box with free shipping and all of these have buy it now or make an offer we're just gonna buy it now for 40 bucks the picture looks interesting I don't think that's what we're gonna get it looks like there's a motherboard for a computer I don't know what's in that white box I doubt this is exactly what we're getting item description is all kinds of stuff specific I love I love it that we're really specific here it's gonna ship 144 feet back 100% the guy seems legit like there's no way we're getting scammed here alright let's go ahead and put that in the cart and the cart the next mystery box I had to grab why because when you click it it says we support content creators it's literally made for YouTube videos this one's going for 50 bucks mystery Barry's electronics home toys makeup and car I'm gonna write in the notes that we need an electronic box don't be sending me any makeup it's just not gonna get put to use YouTube content creators with at least 10,000 subscribers please contact us for additional offers well we're at 9,000 subscribers so we don't qualify one day fan make sure you subscribe so we can get there the $50 eBay mystery box sure how's the feedback all right 97% good feedback 89 transactions like we're gonna take the risk and see what's good okay so the third box is the most expensive here you guys know I got a ball at least on one box it's a $200 mystery electronics surprise box not even mystery box surprise box so we'll see you it's good item description video game systems and games mystery box if we get like a Gamecube I can't be mad like that's worth 200 bucks to me this is tough this is tough like this time around we have much better feedback than the last video so I'm feeling pretty confident let's add this to cart so we're in car right now and quickly boat up in the iCard which mystery box you guys think is gonna be the most worth it is it good $200 one is the $50 one or is it the $40 one I got them all in cart here so let's just hit checkout and just like that we ordered three mystery boxes so in the last video they took about a week to come hopefully I mean just judging by our shipping estimate that's what we can expect here I know it doesn't really matter now that these are ordered but hopefully we don't get crap like I really would like to not get makeup we'll just have to wait and see so took about a month but all the mystery boxes did arrive kind of surprise one got lost on eBay we didn't even get tracking for it it was this fifty dollar box right here so it's somehow showed up I didn't know FedEx was taking care of this one but they took care of the boys so if you guys want to send anything to our Pio box I might start up a new series soon there's the address right there but yeah let's just jump on into it so we're gonna check out the $40 box first then we'll get to D 50 and then the big 201 201 is a little hefty it is a little heavy let's just jump on into this $40 box one now in the original video things turned out pretty good in the end I'm actually excited to continue doing more of these drop a like and you guys want another one I'm hopeful we spent two hundred ninety dollars total okay wow this box is falling apart okay all right well I'm not I can't say I'm surprised so forty bucks got us this sort of retro II oh whoa what that it's not the game council that I'm curious about it's the webcam I think this is like a hundred dollar webcam the logitech 1080p HD webcam yo I gotta get a model number of this hold up wow I'm really shocked but this webcam is fifty two bucks so on to the main event we all know how a webcam works we have this Atari game console now I check something out like this at the impulse buy walmart do you miss that video I'll leave a link right up there in the iCard it's it's interesting so it plugs in a retro set or wait is there HDMI I don't think there's HDMI over there so it just plugs in with VGA cables so honestly the Atari flashback you're gonna have tons of fun the webcam I think is the real star of this particular mystery box I mean 50 to dog webcam and a $40 mystery box this console costs a minimum of 30 bucks so if you really want to get down to the technicals you're coming out on top so solid box so $40 box not too bad let's check out the $50 one let me
