hey what's up guys welcome back a techsmartt for another video starting in the model 3 but I'm not talking about it in this one well I found something I wanted on Craigslist saw that I made a video about it a year ago the back story is too real and well alright alright I bet you're wondering how I got here it started in November a 14 I remember it like it was yesterday a calm breezy yesterday South Park was hot six episodes in they were on a tip no one else could feel come the seventh episode that's when things would change forever the episodes name is grounded vindaloo and the boys go through another adventure all you really need to know is at the end they realize it's one giant simulated loop from everyone's friends Steve at customer service who gives the line hello customer service this is Steve then nothing two years goes by future I mean designer the Panda panda guy drops Timmy Turner a song depicting the love of trappin and burner phones all in one song kana that everyone remembers from The Fairly OddParents the song is 165 million views but still nothing happens another two years goes by January 31st 2018 techsmartt uploads I used a burner phone for 24 hours challenge the first time I said I loved using a burner phone in public on a video for the first time this really set the sequence of events in motion the rest could not have been imagined cut to this year August 2019 the smartphone maker releases the blue collaboration with supreme Zowie 2.4 a $60 retailing burner phone with the whole fixation of supreme continuing their accessories and basically just slapping their red logo on something charging two to three times more and we thought that was it or what cut to this very video I am driving to go meet someone that I messaged on Facebook marketplace because while the original blue Zoey might go for $30.00 supremes retails for $60 and like all good things this sells for a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars the first week that it comes out so the guy on Facebook marketplace by the name of Steve says he'll sell it for the low low price of a hundred and fifty dollars if I meet up with them granted I didn't tell him my real name because I know that he thinks my name is mark everything goes to plan we have a scheduled meet up and then things get a little weird so I'm racing I'm racing as fast as I can in autopilot so only as fast as it'll let me I get to the Starbucks I jump out of the car run all the way about two feet to where the door is of the Starbucks stand there and then he pulls up Steve Steve gets out of the car shows me the red phone asks or do mark I say of course we met on Facebook Messenger didn't we give him the cash secure the phone open it up to make sure the goods are legit and we drive away then all of a sudden I get a text on the same phone I'm having a conversation with Steve on scheduling this meetup and he goes your name's now mark are you techsmartt I should have used a burner phone or at least any other phone that doesn't have iMessage and here we are do you supreme blue Zoey two point four the official burger [Music] so now in the present we have the blue is Zoey 2.4 originally released somewhere between 2010 2019 the earliest I could find was around 2015 then they teamed up with supreme dropped the supreme collaboration this phone non supreme goes for around 22 bucks on ebay with supreme MSRP was 60 and then his high piece to 150 to $200 instantly on any resale site so it's awesome that the Steve price from the simulation was 150 dollars tech specs on this is basically what you would want in a burner phone no LTE 3G basically enough of a screen a little bit of a browser it's enough to get you in the know but keeping the calls down low right or your iMessage in people mmm here we go it's it's just I'm almost disappointed that this came too late in my supreme phase days my supreme phase days you guys if you've been subscribed or you just go back and look at the playlist I was I was in it thick and here is the blue phone so it's a supreme right on the front and on the back it's what you would expect I really just want to jump into this and see what features there's any games the kind of cool if there was like snake so you have two SIM card slots nice very nice it does fit the burner phone criteria and you do have a micro SD for expandable storage only up to 32 gigabytes so you could put the beetles and a few classics the full catalogs on there but I wouldn't really be going on the road or on the run for that long and only rocking a 32 gig card I would have to get a different phone there's there's there's better options out there then maybe the one that says supreme is it even waterproof like that's something you need in a burner phone so taking it off here built-in FM antenna okay what else do we get oh nice be nice micro SD card 16 gigabytes whoa so this is actually the supreme edition they got the boot logo on there too which is kind of rare if you think about supreme what they typically do with accessories they just go all right a gas-powered bike sure just throw the brand on there and really like what could you do you couldn't put supreme gasoline see what I did there I mean you probably got to put 93 in it but when it comes down to tech I actually like seeing they got a boot animation on there it's customized so on the screen you have supreme pretty much basic burner phone setup here contacts messaging FM radio settings games there's a little bit entertainment on here organizer because you got to keep a very detailed lifestyle if you're using one of these multimedia video recorder just see let's just see if anyone finds this they didn't take me I went voluntarily to F house where he films every single day and says don't come out until you get 4 million subscribers send help it was too late I think I think if it really comes down to it this could be the new flip minnow if you grew up with one of those had that USB this is it it's smaller it's a little bit more delicate I really like what's going on here and of course I like what's going on in every burner phone you don't even have to front I don't even have to front that's a no cap situation I actually would rock this at the retail with out the logo on it I just feel like the logo is more flashy it's just it's not burner phone material you don't want flash when you're trying to hide the cash diving into this let's see if there's anything please plug in headphone oh wow let's check out the actual phone headphone jack on the bottom microUSB port to charge it up camera on the back is a 2 megapixel shooters so this is check in the boxes that need to be checked what are those boxes call history I mean the icons look nice big and friendly so you can at least see it if you're driving real fast got a helicopter or five above you so there's no one in the missed calls I was thinking I'd maybe get like the supply chain in Canada or at least where you can buy those 16-ounce hoodies man I could just get those for for bulk who start my own messaging is it and it's with t9 so if you've never seen one of these burner phones before or you have been so blessed to get one with the keyboard boom you got one with t9 you gotta press it a few times you'll get your letter to show up what else is on here so games bubble party mix story mode endless mode oh it's alright so it's kind of like a bejeweled this is basically your average burner phone with a browser needing a SIM card I don't want to get traced but unlike some other youtubers out there that you see things in two-dimensional really not just the 3d beauty that this world and this burner phone has to offer think when this would actually come out it would resell as high as $1,000 but we know because the simulated Steve hooked it up for 150 how in your right mind could you make such a claim that this would go up to a grand my resale up to $1,000 that's definitely when you know you've never ever ever even seen anything that's supreme in real life let's hope they don't but maybe they do continue this kind of collaboration and yeah that's basically the supreme burner phone it's finally a real thing I can say so myself and probably will use this until I have to throw it away so that's gonna do it for this video if you guys enjoyed make sure you drop a like and get subscribe if you're new let me know in the comments if there's any other hypebeast tech you want us to try out like the louis vuitton air pods you get where I'm going I'll catch you guys in the next one all right Ron okay sounds good
