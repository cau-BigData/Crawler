hey what's good guys welcome back to techsmartt for a very special video I'm joined with my sister Carson and we're checking out the brand new Nike adapted BB Nike self-lacing basketball shoe it's that time of the year we roll the intro alright guys so as you might know I love these things if you've missed the videos right up there in the iCard last time I checked it out with Kate $720 self-lacing Nike shoes those are the adapt one-point O's in this video we got the nike adapt BB it says Earl and that's basically Nikes basketball self-lacing shoe I did see a few players wearing this Carson you like shoes right yeah that's good are you excited have you seen pictures of these and what do you think what are your first impressions I like the color scheme with self-lacing it's like autonomous it's like your shoes drive themselves I feel I feel like that that's pretty accurate comparison we got these on eBay because Joe couldn't pull it off Joe's friends Joe's always got a friend but that friend did not come through all right I'll wait to boom and what size you every 10 so what I'm interested to see is since these are a 9 and I'm obviously a 13 and I don't think a 13 is gonna fit a size 10 I want to see if the self-lacing feature can still be tight around Ed's foot if he just leaves them on lace I mean that would be pretty sweet imagine if it was like a small medium and large size shoe and you didn't need to ever get a size again Carson has your shoes ever come with a mat before so this is the charging mat that Carson spoiled a little earlier Carson do you know what's in here there's a USBC charger on here I'm assuming person that just plugs right in so that's it with the shoes we got I'm kind of interested to see Oh beep that out so lights illuminate when the shoes are in contact with the mat it's kind of nice I mean not not every phone or every wireless charger tells you when it's charging we got a big lens on this guy so there's actually an app it's on iOS and Android it's just an Ikea dap dap see what we get nike adapt your pretty arm branded a step into the future and finally let us create an account who solved it to connect your shoes all you have to do is put your phone near your left shoe just a button mine still have not connected oh don't mind literally just said connecting so both of these shoes independently pair to your phone curious if it's bluetooth 5 maybe 3 hours of charged on tap to confirm press any button so these white lights start to appear I don't want to lose it so I'm gonna beat you to the red sugar ready I will boom so my pair has confirmed you have orthotics I do have massive pancake keep adapting your feet whether or not if they're smart they should tell me there are no feet in these shoes right honestly there's right shoe found I think that's what we got to do whoa tell them what you feel I'm struggling [Music] to the tighten and untie new shoes you basically moved the element are down so they're pretty I guess some loose right now no those are really tight you move them down to loosen them you move them up to tighten them so you kind of fine-tune it that's really cool and then it will just max out so won't go all the way up it'll just stop if you can't get any tighter yeah kind of cool pretty smart shows battery life of each shoe cuz that's a new statistic you probably need probably notification somewhere along the lines so I got race your blue purple pink blast I'd wear them as a gym shoe probably wouldn't wear them for basketball just cuz like your ankles aren't supported on the side but they are pretty comfy for everyday wear do you think they're fashionable beyond that like would you wear is a toilet out on the town I think that's why there is a pull tab I'm not resisting like my toes are trying to cooperate right now you're almost halfway there Big Time Rush boom see so it's really all about leverage now try it on the socket one Carson what if I what if you're a paramedic what if you want to do this as a job boom you rescued me just like that I'm pretty good here to be honest you saved my my luxury so what do you think these shoes you're actually gonna wear now that you have a pair it just said you're gonna wear them at least for the first week you're gonna have to the people got to know and she'll be on our Instagram life you guys know on the insta story if she likes them or not and they're right I will try and update you with my very busy schedule all my classes are very difficult second semester of my senior year at high school you're on your way it's not too late to start a channel that's what we're trying to do [Music] [Music] capture that cameraman so just by pressing the buttons haven't even gone in app yet I would say they're pretty tight on my feet scale on a 10 with 10 being like well my feet are gonna turn blue I'd give him like a 6 6 and a half maybe like a 7 at best it's not bad I feel like I could run it I was ever in a situation had to grab something real quick you know not like I've been in that before I could do it we're out on the court now to test out the adapt BBC how good of a basketball shoe they are place mask well Josh that win it so ed you've been hoping for how long my whole life really I'm in trouble I haven't played in five years but back up again awesome I suck so what could go wrong we're

nines what do you think [Music] [Music] [Music] final point [Music] Wow I got killed 5-0 and what do you think about the shoes they're a little heavy but the mobility is there they felt good I played
