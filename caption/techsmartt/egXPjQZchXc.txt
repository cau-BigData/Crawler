so if you expect I made this video on this three-dollar soda gadget that looked really cool on Amazon but when I got it it completely sucked whoa and I called it a gadget but I have a confession this thing's not a gadget it doesn't have bluetooth no battery powers not even rechargeable you lied to me it has nothing in so I found something a little cooler this one is actually a gadget and the cool part about it is it cost two bucks on eBay shipped or eight bucks link down below to Amazon if you guys wanna check those out they'll be linked down below so hopefully this soda gadget doesn't suck I mean it's dollar last but we got to put it to the test requires two doublea's we're gonna put it in the top it's called the magic tap which is just like the greatest name ever and hopefully it actually works I got some high hopes for it like it's not gonna leak all over the place like the other video you saw that video drop a like on this one it was bad it was a disaster I had so much higher expectations for it so sliding this in it's my first time setting up something with batteries before got it pretty much all set so you guys kind of get what's about to go down here you pretty much just plunge this down into milk jugs for example you can pick up like a 1 liter gallon 1 liter gallon I'm so tired yeah we had finals this week it was brutal I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put this and like a gallon of 5-hour energy it's gonna work perfectly but basically you just submerge the thin end here in your liquid so if you wanted us to fix it on top of like a one gallon milk jug it would screw on top here and then when you hit this blue switch milk starts dispensing out so this should work with pretty much any liquid right yeah the magic tap in theory should work on any type of liquid so I picked up the thirst puncher never heard of this before and then of course we got the traditional the thirst quencher so let's give this a whirl to test this out we're just gonna submerge the white end in the top BAM and just like that it sits perfectly on top of the nozzle what I'm noticing is this like a there's like a rubber top so it can really fit it's not gonna be going anywhere won't be leaking out so to dispense it and I don't know if you guys can see this too well but once I hit this blue button here liquid will start coming out the top and flowing let's give it a whirl mm-hmm that works and that tastes really good the thirst puncher solid so when you press the button here it's just it just starts coming out so if you're a head like a party you just need that need to need things this gadgets already off to a great start and it's actually a gadget let's try it with the traditional thirst quencher put that on top there make sure it's an airtight seal jiae's no luckily there is an on/off switch here so you're not gonna be a Keaton and pretty much just trigger it every time we're trying to move it so with Gatorade for example just show you guys that it works that's like an electric straw that seriously is like an electric strut BAM a little something-something there I'm not even gonna throw that in my mouth I don't trust with my hands at best so let's try this out with something that's not a thirst quencher like are you tired heaviness that bottle up now we're gonna try it with some hot sauce I don't know where the guys found this this is the louisiana supreme hot sauce is the perfect hot sauce for me let's try this out so things that are a little thicker than your standard thirst-quenching drink I think it would work and honestly this might not be a bad idea if you have like some hot wings you just want to splice the sauce on you don't want to tip the bottle up I don't know why you're that lazy but hey if it works oh it's gonna work it doesn't even fit on all the way but here we go will this work on hot sauce that first sure that's a lot of sauce whoa they called me the sauce boss Wow that is for sure working I mean I really like hot sauce so i spicy i had spicy for sure Oh Matt where'd you get this supreme dude I know it's Thursday but like did you did the site crash to the apps did you get through you have to get a bot it's flowing pretty well even if it doesn't fit perfectly on the lid Wow wow that is hot that is hot dude for the magic tap BAM well hot sauce bread action tastes good it's edible I was gonna dip it on the table but that's probably the worst idea oh I had this for breakfast every morning once I'm you know doing the magic tap on my 5-hour energy man it works I'm am 2 bucks pretty solved I just found the instructions here and it says the following are not recommended for dispensing with the magic tab carbonated beverages beverages containing pulp there goes your OJ sarsaparilla are emulating oh wait that's root beer sarsaparilla we're learning something so it says it's not recommended for carbonated drinks but doesn't doesn't tell me not to do it so we're gonna try it with this Mountain Dew and just see if they're wrong no one knows when this product is made do you know what that means I'm gonna heat up the scissors again alright let's try this with carbonated soda see if it makes a difference just slides right on it Oh what I fit maybe just sits perfectly at the top switched on I'm not gonna let it I'm not gonna let it get all over me any guesses we're making some progress it's really foamy I start to see why I start to see why this doesn't work for carbonated gadgets because it's injecting air through the bottom and that's how it brings a liquid up its suction technology you know all about this a little bit a little bit you're getting the most foamy drink yeah it's like half on half off that's pretty much what you can expect yeah definitely doesn't work that's it for the magic tab if you want something for soda definitely pick up the $3 soda gadget any other liquid like milk pick up the magic tap that's gonna do it for this makes you guys can
