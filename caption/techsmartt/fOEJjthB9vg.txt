so I keep hearing about this thing called the type odds challenge and since you guys know I love my challenges here on YouTube this one I'm gonna have to stay away from or I might die quickly vote up in the iCard if you guys have heard of this thing called the type odds challenge basically people are taking type odds which is like a laundry detergent here in the US and it comes prepackaged in these pods versus like the bottle that you might see here's one of them right here and they're chewing on them they're putting them in their mouths and some of these people are teens like you and me trying to eat these pods that's a no-no be gross that'd be gross to eat yeah but where'd you come from but it kind of got me thinking a little bit since Apple created the air pods in the whole pods game and maybe even the home pod if we actually see that this year what's the difference between type odds and air pods only one way to find out do not and I will say it again do not eat time don't even eat the vegan Tide Pods I picked these up if you're a vegan like me these are the ones that are free and gentle so this cost about 19 bucks and you get a tub of these now I got Apple earpods here this is a brand new pair this is actually my 20th pair not because I've lost them but I keep hooking you guys up with them so make sure you guys follow me on the instance story if you guys haven't already I might drop a pair over there after this video wraps up so we got our air pots here costing 159 bucks I'll leave them linked down below let's take out a single tie pod and kind of just start comparing what's good so I'm gonna open up the Apple earpods here what else you get in the box a lightning cable like you guys have seen tons of unboxings of these air pods you get like this dental floss case versus this nice tied pod case the tie pots are extremely fragile so you can't really put this in your pocket where is your air pods they're a little bit more durable when they flip up they're ready to pair now you actually get to with the air pods where's the tide pods how many'd you get in here you see that 57 Tide Pods I mean I don't know about you guys but I'm starting to know which one is a little more worth it and this selling t bux so you get to earpods now it totally built quality are you kidding me dude it's gonna rupture I know it's gonna break it's probably gonna get my eyes I made this video where I actually hated these air pods originally it's the Apple earpods rant check it out right up there now I love them so you can definitely see what's good there it's nice in the case you get a few extra charges that charges with the Lightning port at the bottom you can't charge your tide pod it's a one-and-done kind of kind of deal so I got a wireless charger you know it's 2018 and might wirelessly charge no there's no light it's a good wireless charger but it's not supported on this one maybe on the next generation so this is 35 cents paired 159 I know which one I'm buying alright let's see how the air pods gonna feel my ears and if I can shake them out of them hmmm maybe you can't really shake those out let's see if I can put the tide pod in my ear hang on let's start to hear something with the air pods I already got impaired to my iPhone 10 pretty much just pull them out connect I love these things I'd like I'm trying to wrap it the lyrics are on screen and I'm still messing up so there's two buttons on here you got your blue and your white one buttons aren't responsive I think I got a defective one I got 57 56 more 56 more to try out maybe those buttons will work on there but it doesn't look like these are gonna pair to my phone it's got an old generation of bluetooth down here so that's something you need to take into account doesn't work now one thing that I really want to try is cutting open a pair of hair pods and just kind of seeing what's inside my boys over at what's inside I was just kicking it with them in Utah this last weekend we missed that if you're not following us on the instance story so seriously make sure you're checking that out let's put open a pair of ear pods and see what's actually in them or we're gonna at least try to it's like we're scouring some clay oh it's got work craft channel now you got a problem with arts and crafts all right I'm probably not gonna be able to crack those but what I will be able to crack is a tide pot it you guys ever seen what's inside a time pod Wow we've we've cut open the side bud oh so this is what the kids like they like this little gummy wrapper here it smells really good too but it's not jello it is not a fruit roll-up it it does look like a gusher not gonna lie slightly aroused but like not enough to where I'd want to eat this I get aroused in crowds so for the final test we're gonna see whether the Tide Pods or the air pies are waterproof so we're gonna put one of the vegan Tide Pods in there I've been one of the regular Tide Pods we're gonna see how long it takes to dissolve it's not a bath bomb I don't know why I was thinking to be a bath bomb I don't know if you guys can see this too well but we got some detergent already seeping out of the regular Tide pod ready look at all that you got a taste to soup every good chefs got a taste of soup all right I'll taste the soup where's the spoon I actually want to see what happens if you put air pods in a tied solution I've actually washed a bunch of air pods before so this shouldn't be anything new we're gonna see if they still work after this I think they'll still connect to bluetooth like I've done this a few times all right let's dish out our iPod we're going fishing that's it I'm going fishing we've lost the air pods in the suit this substance is so murky so after looking for about 25 minutes guys we had to call off the search team they dissolved in the water don't put your air pods in Tide Pods they're just gonna fight and you don't want that blood on your hands blood on your hands that's gonna do it for this video this was just kind of a fun video where we compared Tide Pods to air pods make sure you guys get subscribed with notifications turned on if you're new and let me know in the comments if you guys are just joining us notice squad make sure you're following us on the instant story cuz that's where it's happening that's where it's fun and I'll see you guys later peace
