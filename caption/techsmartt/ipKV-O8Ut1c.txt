someone's got to go to these stores to find this stuff out that person's me welcome back to another episode of weird shopping this time we are at Walgreens you guys voted up in the iock are telling me which door to go to next so what do you guys want to go to a Walgreens CVS or rite-aid so we're here Walgreens let's do it I just picked up this card here before we start our shopping adventure sad card just look at the weevil so when you're thinking Walgreens or CVS you're not really thinking too much on the tech and gadget side but they got some pretty sweet products this is like that as seen on tv section I got a mini vacuum it's a smiley face it's not all that smiley it actually eats things up - whoa mini vacuum floors counters rugs excited so most you guys know now I check out a lot of headphones and speakers so my hearing is kind of going it's it's on its way out I'm only 20 but this product looks like you can fix it it's called the NSA not NSA it's actually listening so there are no batteries required in this amplified sound looks like a hearing aid I don't know how this is actually gonna work oh it's rechargeable that's interesting wow this air hockey table is probably gonna be the last thing you'd expect to see at a Walgreens 20 bucks sure 20 bucks for a mini air hockey table at Walgreens yeah a lot of you guys say the studio looks a little like a strip club I don't really see it but I know one thing's for sure strip clubs have laser lights we don't have that now we're about to get it they sell this at walkins 50 bucks though look at all the holidays covered Christmas Halloween Halloween is right around the corner 50 bucks worth it now I normally check out a lot of phones and earbuds and speakers we're changing the game up a TV antenna 4k broadcast that seems a little like we're over delivering so I don't know how much this thing is but free TV well don't forget to pay for it first but mostly free TV it wouldn't be a weird shopping trip unless we found a drone this one seems a little interesting kinda like the Toys R Us want to check that one out make sure you check out that episode after this video seems like just a regular helicopter that goes up I'm sick that's what helicopters do oh really and it says it's easy to fly I'll be the judge and I'm picking up silly string because for four bucks like I wouldn't I we got a pretty good amount of stuff I'm actually really happy with this trip we got some really interesting stuff let me go check out we're gonna head back to the studio and I should check these things out so in total I spent a hundred and forty seven dollars actually like a hundred and sixty one with tax at Walgreens that is way more than I've ever spent at a Walgreens before and we actually got some really good stuff guess I'm check out anything mention this video I'll do my best to link it down below some of this stuff is just really really really weird the first thing that we're gonna check out is this sound amplifying headset I had to check this one out I don't know the as seen on tv section at all convenience stores is really poppin this looked interesting it's a sound amplifier it's women-owned cuz that's something on the box that's really awesome there's a rapid charger I think this is like a hearing aid but not one that's custom fit to your ears sound amplifier improves amplification up to thirty times like yes this might be the next generation of ear buds right before our eyes so this is what it looks like you get a rechargeable stand my grievous P would have been cool but just docks right in there that's actually really cool just docks right into the base you pull it out you're ready to go I'd imagine you'd want to get two of these to complete the setup I don't think there's bleu cheese there is not bluetooth on this earbuds so to turn it on it's really simple just hit the on button whoa I can oh this is gonna be this is gonna be crazy I can already hear it we have a dial right on the center that adjusts the volume we're at level four so I'm gonna sweep that on down to two don't know why I said sweep there we're gonna try this on feel like a secret spy yo I actually feel like a secret spot it's got that Detective interrogation room kind of feel like you're watching something on a court tape or something are you asking me a question that was really specific I know yeah it actually is an O okay that all right I've taken that out that actually amplifies the sound and that's only mode - let's raise it up to level four rest and peace my ears yo whoa yo at level four now this is quite the experience wow that's really loud I'm gonna do something probably against my doctor's wishes they do the ears right it's like a hearing out what's the what's the science term for the doctor that checks out ears let me know in the comments we're doing something against his wishes we're gonna play some music with it on oh I can just hear it echoing I'm just gonna play a little DJ snake and try this out all right we're gonna go max volume all right sounds good oh no no oh that is like max volume at two times in one year that is extremely uncomfortable I'm just I just hear ringing I see rings - that should not be happening next up is something that I hope doesn't make a loud noise it's this rechargeable no it's not a rechargeable vacuum cleaner it's an as seen on tv emoji vacuum cleaner I don't know why I thought I was rechargeable it looks like a USB vacuum cleaner it's mini we got a smiley face on here I think you can get a few different faces that's cool meter vacuum cleaners now of emojis on the faces all right so it's battery powered and right down at the bottom you can see that's where you got your bristles your fun your fun stuff and just an on/off switch all right seems like he's got a little sucking action so what I want to try out now just demo this for you guys is crush up some cheese nips my favorite snack of all time good luck cheese it okay we're good to go and we're gonna see if the emoji vacuum cleaner can suck it up pretty easy task oh I hear it I hear it whoa are we just spitting it out yeah it's like coming out the back end here did I not handle all these treatments all right I think we just clogged it guys let me know in the comments am I doing this right does it feel right whoa that just really sucked it all up alright let's turn this off it did half the job of sucking it up where Oh Oh that's where the cheese nips hide in the bottom it actually works which I'm really surprised by but anything larger than a cheese snip you're pretty much out of luck like a screw it will screw this thing up next up is something I'm really excited for this is an indoor TV and indirect HD TV antenna basically we're covered we can start getting some channels and I don't know if you guys have been subscribed for a long time but I haven't actually owned a TV which is kind of crazy because if this actually works this TV down here is finally gonna get some love and we're gonna get some free channels well they're not actually free cuz I paid for but let's check this out so I've seen a few of these in my lifetime and I've never actually had any luck with them so hopefully today is the day damn we get some metal wow that just did we break it no we did of course we didn't break it we're gonna fix it this is Pete in the Builder here so you pretty much keeps plug in this and to the wall or your Koufax do I have Koufax here I'm gonna have to look for that let's get this set up in the meantime I don't think this thing takes mathletes it definitely doesn't but one of the offers you get on here is set it up with sling TV I know what that is Wow get a few channels we get NBC ABC think that's CBS Fox get like seven channels sounds good sometimes my mess ups to actually work out my favor it's not a Kovacs cable it's just an antenna board so let's pull this TV on up we're gonna screw it into the back 10 it in I'm actually really happy this is included on a TV for once because I'm now checking out an antenna most of the time you know you just hook something up now we actually need it so storms can easily knock out cable or satellite signals so if I live in a rainy spot probably not the best I have this I finally got the antenna setup I don't actually own a TV so this is the best that I could do but I think I got it right so let's try this out it's actually really easy to set up I don't actually own a TV so this would be a big all Mike we did it we did it we got channels all right let's see if we got another channel Oh even volume I don't know what channel this is it's coming in a little pixelated a little distorted but it's free TV I can't complain all right it's not 100% free but for the most part it's pretty free PBS that looks actually clear ok moving the antenna no that is a no-go you got to keep this in one spot that would make sense it's looking pretty good I mean I got the antenna put in the middle of my studio right now so I'm sure if I move it to like a window or so I can pick up every single in LA the quality looks good too free TV who would have thought time to get things a little more fancy in the studio I have a ton of fun LED lights but I don't have any lasers this is some decorative laser gun it really fits around the holidays like we got a Santa on the box a ghost of bat for Halloween we're pretty much covered where's Thanksgiving like do we not have Turkey we Pete we would be covered I could just flip this on leave it on to the rest of the year and be good to go showing my spirit showing that I celebrate a holiday so this is what you get in the box basically this is meant for lawn so if you have a lawn got some grass you put this in you can prop it up and point it towards your house kind of getting the full effect but we're gonna do one better I'm gonna hold the gun just kidding there's a base here that's sweet so we got the steak not the one you eat the one for your yard and then the base one if you don't have a yard plug this in let's see how this goes all right here we go powered it on first come on why don't you work I think we broke the Santa laser gun that's what we're calling it guys I've been reading through the instructions and I think we broke it this thing was 50 bucks so the good news is I'm gonna to get my 50 bucks back at Walgreens the bad news is I wanted to turn this place into a nightclub it was on for like a quick second show it like literally turned on for a very quick second we try one more time there's power being delivered to this AC port here when in doubt shake it I'm really upset disappointment disappointment family moving on from one fail we might have a second fail it's another drone comment down below right now if you can tell me how many drones there's been in this season of weird shopping we've had a drone in almost every single episode first person to get it right I'll pin but all right we got another drone it's a helicopter this one the cool part about it is it says it's easy to fly that's really what I'm looking for and easy to fly drones nothing with any fancy tricks or stunts just need something I can easily fly all right we got a helicopter nice shiny red helicopter and then the remote think we even get some extra propellers in here just in case you crash it always nice and they include those so here is the controller the cool part about it is it is actually a charge cord built-in so you don't even need to go visit a wall got it all right here and let's see if your boy can fly this whoa whoa all right whoa that thing has got some spirit I think I let off the throttle there so I'm just gonna let it go I already know how this is going to go so give it the helicopter a little bit more room let me usually do just it seems like it's fallen to its death do the helicopter more juice I hit that help the Elat our buddy here whoa yo that see that's the first drone ever attack me Jack controlling this isn't the easiest let's try to give it one more flood you got this fun bonus item time soon this is actually something I didn't expect to see at Walgreens and air hockey table 20 bucks like I gotta check this out and says it's just me here today I'm gonna be playing with myself no not in that way just be playing air hockey by myself wow this is a really nice table 20 bucks I was expecting some cheapo stuff we got the kit down here batteries those fell out some nice plastic guards this is like a proper set up air hockey at Walgreens it looks like some assembly is required just give me a sec I'll get this I'm gonna get this right so we don't have another drone incident that's the piece mr. drought so I got it all set up maybe you guys can hear that there's actual air being blown it looks really good it's built really well before I drop the puck here you even get to which is kind of nice I mean 20 bucks let me know in the comments right now who your favorite hockey team is mine's got to be the Blackhawks they're probably gonna fight the air stop sweet let's do the puck drop all right I'm playing against myself you can see how the puck moves yo that's some solid movement that puck is real agile I feel like a hockey commentator right now who's gonna win this is it Keaton or Keaton [Applause] Walgreens well done you crushed it [Applause] pretty crazy that's weird shopping at Walgreens if there's one I have on this list that's my favorite it's gotta be the TV antenna if you thought I forgot about the silly string I didn't let me know
