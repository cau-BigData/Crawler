oh man oh man not again hey guys welcome back to techsmartt and right in front of me is kind of an interesting box so this is the omen by HP a big thanks to HP for sending this out sponsoring this video so if you guys want to check out the HP omen it's gonna be linked in the description below definitely check it out click it see what you think and then let me know in the comments I first saw this thing it looked huge it looked like it was packing some heat that's not super cheap so you want a good laptop for whatever it is this is HP omens first overclockable laptop pictures hopefully it's exactly what I saw online is this so you know when you like buy a brand new car and you get that car sticker it's usually like this size something you could hold put up in a frame or whatever that's what you're getting here so HP's like yo you probably don't read the tiny manuals so we're gonna give you something you have to read so these are where the specs are reports basic stuff you guys know I'll check that out a second this thing's packing sheet like look at this thing I can't even I can't even have anything else on the desk that's how much heat this thing's back so this is the HP omen and this has to be the biggest and probably most powerful laptop I have ever checked out like this thing based on what I've seen based on a size like this thing looks like it's meant for gaming so let's just see what this is about like I don't even know where to start what to talk to you guys about yet like it's got this nice aluminum finish on the sides this kind of dope emblem right here so it lights up even the keyboards fire so on the keyboard here you just have some tactile keys it's like your standard laptop keyboard with like switches that are just barely pressing so you can type faster or whatever this I actually dig because you can hear the feedback in the keys you hear that feedback like it's actual keys you can hear and at least when I'm gaming I like that oh do have you see in this Aki's dude I must have missed that when I was looking at this thing online like you guys know I was a big runescape ER having programmable hotkeys at one point in time used to make or break my game so that's dope sweet so there's red LEDs that come in between the keys so it's backlit and it really just kind of accents the whole laptop well you got the red light on the front you got the red light here pretty much just have a really good esthetical but for i/o imports on the side here we got a USB 3 you point five millimeter jack and then a headphone port not all gaming laptops have this so that's big on the back as where it gets real saucy you got two USB sees Ethernet port not all laptops have this you know how important this gets for gaming right hdmi displayport and then a USB 3 so your stacked but it doesn't stop there they literally give you every feature SD card slot another USB 3 and then the charge port so this laptops basically packing every port and feature you'd need so let's just whoa I mean like every time I open it up I just feel like a beast I feel like I'm about to go into a game I just feel like I have the power so what else is up on this laptop we got a trackpad that's basic every laptop has one and just like first impressions with it I'd probably say I'd want to get a gaming mouse for like any serious session touchpads fine the trackpads whatever but like you're gonna need a real mouse and so you guys know there's Bang & Olufsen speakers says it on the logo to actually put this thing the test so I'm gonna fire up a tech smart video I don't see these speakers can blow me away I was not expecting the sound to really sound that fool I don't know if it's because of the Bang & Olufsen speakers or just how big these speakers are but it's definitely a perk to having a laptop like this like whoa that sounded really good man play me again music would sound amazing on this you're probably thinking yourself and let me know in the comments what you guys are feeling about the omen but you're probably saying oh man the omen probably are making puns like that you guys are funny but not that funny probably thinking like what kind of specs is this thing huh so it's rocking an Intel i7 7700 CPU it's got an nvidia 1070 GPU with g-sync tech so gaming should be perfect on this thing in theory I gotta put that to the test 16 gigs of ram and a one terabyte hybrid drive so basically you have all the essentials and like no joke even with the ports and the speakers the size you basically have all the essentials to go off the grid it's still live your life the only thing left for us to do now is actually game on this thing we replaced in fortnight so about an hour of letting fortnight update and do it we're about to play a game now I'm showing you guys the screen so I'm gonna use my left hand just cuz WASD are over here if I can get one kill hopefully you drop a like I'm not that good a fortnight I'm still trying to get better scream looks really good speakers still sound dope let's do this let's do this let's do this let's do this you guys can roast me in the comments with how bad I am I hope you do no ninja yeah it looks really good really digging those speakers kind of gives you a nice surround sound experience just from what I'm hearing and you guys probably want to know how the 1070 is working I'm running this like ultra high settings on fortnight I'm such a noob with my left hand like I'm such a new this is just pathetic you're pathetic you got to get better at PC I've been thinking about streaming on Twitch let me know in the  no no that was the shortest game I think I've ever been a part of let's just it's just not and say we did you didn't see that and with sweet is like this thing's big but I like the size like you can take this on the go it's got like a five-hour battery life from what I've been reading and like what everyone else has so that's not too bad and what's sweet is with that GPU in here if you want to be a youtuber and start editing like 4k videos you're not gonna have a problem you want to start playing games on the go I think this is a pretty good option for you like I'm gonna do is [Laughter] alright at least I saw someone and at least it look really good on the omen I think the only thing left for me to do is get better at fortnight so you guys that's the HP omen if you guys like this video make sure to drop a like and get subscribed if you're new click that circle button right down there check out two other videos right over here after this I'll see you
