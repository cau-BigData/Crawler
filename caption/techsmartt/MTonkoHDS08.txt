josh is getting dropped yeah buddy finish him off you're awesome the rest this videos gonna be me so the first item was a pop which means I owe Josh some cash Josh I don't think you're gonna get two for two here you're not that good hit me with it let's go come on boy all right wow what did you pick out a hamburger telephone in and outs right down the street dog just just take it where it belongs okay I don't want to see it this is a hamburger telephone I have no idea why this exists if this is a landline if this is a cell phone with a SIM card we'll see really quickly this is a landline Joshua how like dog where am i plugging this in they don't even make this jack anymore how do you expect me to test it for the people this is a sick phone I will be the first to say it Josh might get a complete pop on this just because we have no way to test this out I have a cell phone it's 2018 I wish I had a landline but I'm just not an independent man yet so I'm a pretty dependent man on this burger I think this is sick imagine if you had this in your house let's just say it's 1960s bring-bring hello you see this your neighbor's catch you with this they're gonna ask you to go outside because they're gonna want one too and like look at this got cheese you got your Patty you got two buns hun speaker at the top I bet it's really loud Mike at the bottom it's got a nice weight to it I mean it's no iPhone 12 but I would say it's like an iPhone 13 so for 15 bucks Josh I don't know why but this episode I'm feeling like josh is about to clear us out Josh give me the third prop Jesus Josh why dude where'd you get this I don't even want to know I'm guessing a garage sale no dude someone would have probably wanted 100 bucks for this house boss you are killing me dawg if this sucks I don't think it's gonna suck because it looks pretty good you're out 146 bucks you're in the red you're gonna owe me money because you might have thought you got cocky with the last to know welcome to the game alright let's open up these speakers plug them in and toss them out 146 bucks if they're good you know where the links at like maybe josh is trying to help you guys out ooh these speakers actually have some heft on them I'm gonna set this up like Larry the Cable Guy it would be an absolute G and get this the first try so which way does the court go alright I don't know which is supposed to go to which we got our black cable and we have our gray cable I'm just gonna freeball it I'm just gonna put it in whichever one I feel is the right hole and we'll go from there you know black one goes in the blue cuz black and blue that's how they got that alright so these go to the right speaker the left speaker cuz readings hard I should have gone to college that was basically it no it makes sense the black one goes with the black one it's not called black and blue it is black and black the gray one goes with the blue if I ever had to steal a car I guarantee I would get caught I couldn't Hotwire it like we laugh guys but it's not funny these are life skills everyone needs to learn how to hotwire a car no I'm just kidding I don't I think that was something I read in the book like that's what dad's teach their kids you joking me dawg this cable is so long it's wrapped around the wheel on my chair and now it's wrapped around again dude you see what I'm going through thanks Josh blame Josh guys I hope this is the biggest flop ever actually I know LG makes pretty decent speakers so this won't flop if it blocks you're out a hundred and forty six bucks Josh so here's the deal this is meant for a sound bar a TV this is a surround system setup so since I'm just trying to get a style it on my desk I'm not actually gonna plug this into a TV because I am NOT that I need to call Best Buy to that tax smart is being tacked on today so that being said I'm gonna try to open my phone up see if there's Bluetooth on this thing and if it works well jam out if not I'm giving Josh a flop not because the product nope because he didn't tell me I needed a TV and he didn't call bet what we're gonna do about that guy you we might be in luck boys we might be in luck hang on I'm gonna scream if this were a pairing unsuccessful well Josh you flop can't aux cord you need a dongle for that dude got us BC bro they cut the adapter I bet these are sick you know what I bet these are sick
