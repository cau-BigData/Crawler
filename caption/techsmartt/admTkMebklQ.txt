your own rap looking at mine right I found one Bluetooth v5 smart - your phones will try it alright thank you so I got a pair of ear pods here we got the eye 9s ordinary or the i-10 intelligent for $34 what are the ratings say these air pots are fantastic better than Apple for a very small price alright James that's pretty good my man we know it's your listing thank you for the honest review it's not even real so 37 bucks for the eye time-lag air pods 12 bucks nice dude $12 with the charging bank black ear pods tws earbuds they come in like a little pen case oh that's sweet cool white wireless earphone professional stereo Bluetooth hands-free headset slightly bigger than my ear but cool anyway for the price that was from a do Sud from three days ago so he bought it recently Josh discount 2018 new do the discount dude I got to do the discount the $1 discount all the colors sold out for the discount accept the pure white it's like there isn't any other colors to begin with I got a good one power bank I px5 waterproof whoa I'm going to the pool yeah with our ear phones Bluetooth except if you swim with them when they fall out we got six items in the car you're not working hard enough this backpack is not big enough dad it for that's a lie okay let's not be refreshing look at these these are weird all right I'm gonna search something new getting tired of searching air pods I'm gonna search a e RP OD s ear pods ear pods I'm getting a black one-piece air pod no reviews we're going in blind 3,000 million of charging box dude this charging box looks wild whoa dude we're getting really into the Photoshop here this one promises a rainbow comes with the unicorn for $2 the sound is great in its light weight it's funny that it speaks Chinese for the price it's not too bad you see like this is really where we're at six hours ago from a net so I think this one actually comes to you like she got it quickly this one's cool this charging he's like lifts up alright I'm a search Bluetooth gotta switch it up air pods Bluetooth 4.2 so not bluetooth 5.0 which I don't know is actually in the ones that Josh found the high 40s but says it on there so bluetooth 4.2 I mean you search Bluetooth air pots are just gonna come up there's buttons on - oh wow I think that's how you pair them because they're eight dollars my daughter loves them they were great four days ago Darrell five days ago great sound and price Jason it works like it's supposed to the config is a little tricky but once it's set up it works fine so that's what the buttons are for this is what I'm talking about Josh check these out you got to just check out that out for $9 and it's verified doing definitely 100% like tech smart Instagram boom if you get behind a wall its jumpy a little bit if the earpiece is at an angle that makes you sore after a while but it's perfect for the price sixteen dollars sweat proof neck band check that out dude look at where the earbuds are oh well like I think they pull out and they're just retract I was gonna say that'd be really uncommon in the pictures Android 16 hours battery black I'm gonna get the size 9 9 1 get it in black works and feels good around the neck how many you got 11 whoa your budgets huge my man 176 bucks I think I got more items than you two you got all the cheaper 15 whoa whoa easy does it there with the shots my man easy easy it's variety just like that sorry Josh gets you to face everybody all right I already fell in this thing we're gonna wait three weeks or however long it takes some of these things came early and we'll see what happens air pods you ready yeah how do you like air pods honestly I think I know what they're not amazing really really cool yeah pixel buds are you a pixel butts guy no those are really fat ugly hard to please Josh one ever really hard to please people were commenting in the last video saying I was like- and like hard to please so guess what I am so we're back it took about three weeks for everything to come in and you guys can probably tell already what happened we got click baited and that is super true like actually though like i7s i7s by 7s by 7s by seven I said this so what we're gonna do is basically rip open all the ones that look alike kind of see if there's any similarities any differences and we're gonna try them out on both our phones and kind of just tell you guys what's good and what's not the goal is to find the secret pair that is worth a little bit more than we paid for are you ready for this dude we ordered the same damn believe that we got so many air buds well it's the same one because the photos look different and that's ecommerce for you suggestion why is there only one question why is it so dang large like that doesn't yeah I got really large ears throw that in yours oh very uncomfortable headphone is that the second one no that no right is the charging cable okay wait it literally only gave you one yes we only got one I think I might have ordered one or it might have just clicked baited us that's the shark your dude look at this it plugs in like that why honey well cuz that's how they do it you see there's holes on that one too there's no charging this looks like Bionicles did a collab with Apple you get that reference let us know in the comments there noise-canceling because of how thick with two seas these are in my ears so two pair these up all you do is hold down the two buttons on the side wow she sounds like she's talking through a really old phone to try not the i-70 WS is 3-2 it's updated every Friday so I think of the description Apple music Spotify YouTube whatever platform you have play this part alright so this is a sound so far I'm really bad and why don't sound all that bad really I mean it's the same pair compared to the price of these these were $7 that's true $7 I bet in mind and keep in mind is it a wish or a dish alright alright so for 7 1 through 5 for 7 bucks this isn't bad because you're technically still getting a bluetooth like earbud experience Fisher dish 1 through 5 I would say the fact that they're gold adds a little bit side I'd give these a three wish I'm gonna give them a three as well I'd also say it's a wish for $7 they're not that bad and you know price is always fluctuates so links down in the description as you guys know like always let's move out of salt a little spicier we're checking out the I tens now you guys by popular request slam the comments on the $4 fake earpods video I'm already in it I'm sorry and you I didn't wait pretty much I open them whoa these are as good as user really good this case fun case look at the bottom I think yeah yeah yeah 100% too big no it's not Josh wanna know why what dude what whoa look at that LED notifier dudes are closest to the clones that I've seen but I did also order the i-12 tws so in front of us we have four air pods and let us know in the comments if you can guess which one is the real air pot so the actual air pod is this one and they really are similar if you stack them up side by side they're not all that bad looking and these are the eye temps keep that in mind the eye twelves could be game-changing I'm waiting for those to come in the mail oh what's really nice is they don't charge with a hole they just oh they don't yeah okay so like here's the real test the real does the real one charge with the flow put them in your ears the noise is delicious delicious dude they charge real air pods no way no way stop stop dude it's the same technology I think I mean or they just geeked out over me right pull up in this one plug for this one I can't we just mind I don't know I can't tell if that means charging I think we might have just found a little bit of a hack hey if you guys have real air pods or fake air pods at home the I tens try this out and let us know in the comments dugu Zi tens your hearing tests the base is there I like they fall out how do your son honestly this sounds really good how much were these like the I tens were twenty four dollars dude these are really good Oh in the auto play when you put it back in your ears no that's what I'm saying even on Android yeah wait no I think they're I think they're touch capacitive I didn't get to touch him hang on wait check us out yeah dude the right ones play and pause oh and if you DoubleTap it goes to the next track I'm blown away by old technology actually actually I'm telling you the right the right i-10 works success you take it out it doesn't pause it I think my finger touched it last time just so we're totally accurate wish your dish Josh five all day from this side I wish wow that's crazy bike we're so right the only thing I'll say is I wonder what the battery life is on these compared to the air pots I bet it's not good I bet it's not like the best but for $24 compared to air pod price how much is this pair go for Josh 10/10 beans price is always changing on wish this is like this two pair Bluetooth 4.2 now you put this in your pocket and you say you have something going on macho affirmative oh please look like the Louis V once oh yes you can charge your own it can charge your phone it's got a USB port LED indicator I mean if they make the case of that big I hope you can do something oh wow since we only have one most uncomfortable thing I haven't put my ear I feel like I'm sticking something give me your right I'm gonna give me your left oh wait wait that's wait that's left what yeah no yeah no way no no I know we're gonna listen to another playlist josh has got the right one in his ear I got the left one in mine it says it's plenty that gets connected to yours it's connected about I can hear it says it's playing out of the s2 I can hear music alright do you think we have to like power ours down now you need to turn yours back on minor oh no I can't even hear it at all no it's like cutting in and out between channels alright so these are a bus trash sound good you can't even listen to music I'm giving it a 1 those are garbage h PQ q 32 t WS these like bomb says it's got v 5.0 i don't know if that's bluetooth 5.0 in here they have a microphone that light as a feather if he couldn't live as a feather you couldn't figure that one out they're kind of charged HD and noise cancelling what's up with this case oh dude I love this color if you didn't like those last buds you're not okay actually take that back I don't know if I like this color it's skin first I got a skin color at first I thought it was like a nice tan but now I realized it's kind of a puke green mixed with like a skin green but like the last one it also can charge your phone that's kind of a nice bonus I deal with a little larger it looks like a band-aid so they both powered on HP q3 to tws bqq 32 to tws like dude named it something else the base is there mes is there the trebles compounds yeah it's like just it waivers me but it's not bad it's not these are probably but I say how much were these next to the eye tats what's your dish they are rough I hate the case I don't know how much they cost because we can't find them on wish and they look gross so I'm not gonna - and their dish I'm giving them a two as well yeah the base is there I'm pretty impressed by that but the flesh-colored case it's gonna be a no from me dog we don't know what's inside this one oh they're like little earbuds maybe do you remember this design and they used to be like quarterback these are actually cool yeah those are pretty Nick I like this design and then my gue USB cable to charge it up they look nice though I will say this is not that big it's much the buds aren't gonna stay in your ears they don't really have any design to him just it's one plane how do you get him to pie life either a button on it do you loop undone yours yeah the button in there is pretty weird it's like in my ear I feel like I'm shoving I'm good I'm connected it she said great Quinn action this is definitely something to take into account when you're buying ear pods earphones I did I can't get mine a pair see I like how they look though their bullets dude like it like slowly to your bugs nice to see you took a like tiny little bullet you're gonna toss it so let's play and remain awesome okay we're good now so for me what Matt's not playing for me that's hilarious alright well wait let's try alright just like these let's just do it once at the same time three two one did you get it yeah do you get it wish your dish dish I was really excited for this fair I like to design I'm giving them a - dude they don't work zero you're too nice you gotta cut him down dude zero bro I like the look I liked everything about them but you know they don't play in sync slash you're dead to me what next pair wireless headphone wireless headphone you're gonna love these here we get here if you roll up anywhere with this make sure your tips if you like just imagine driving as I have been so micro USB port to charge it and then buttons side zips and backup and volume up/down on/off is your battery but here's what I'm saying you're like chillin you're at work and people are like looking at you cause you have this new weird thing and you just go and put them in your ears like that I see I just don't get the point of the cords if like I don't get it so you're not gonna try them I don't get it the design is already too much for me that I like literally don't even want to hear what they sound like are you supposed to wear them like that do it ridiculous you more ridiculous than it on your neck honest now the good news is Junior junior listen this is the worst way to do this alright let's hear it they sound like yo to be honest they sound pretty good they sound pretty good I still wouldn't buy them because they look ridiculous hey I'm confused wait Josh are you meaning to tell me after the news reports came in last night I look ridiculous so sound quality I would say is probably a three design is about a two Ketan seems to like yep so that makes him a 1 me too me too what's yours I would get these probably three out of five definitely a wish they sound pretty good and I think if you really just have an open mind about the style you might be able to pull off a new look all right we got another one q8 baby what does q8 stand for we don't these are kind of cool I see it is there only one yes oh dude look at the truck no way Josh Josh you get another ear bud you have to plug in I have not seen that whoa check that out where the micro USB port is to charge her up you now have two Oh soon so you do a wraparound okay I you're a spy these are sick $13 be optimistic it's a new wave to check us out well though how do they think yeah they sound pretty good for $13 I would buy them honestly wish your dish that's a wish I give him a four cuz I actually like I like the design I don't let you try them on them I think it's cool that like you have this weird little like wraparound thing with your ear I think these are the only air pods slash earphones slash ear buds on this list from wish you could run with and like confidently say you're still gonna get music at least for one year yeah from one year you're getting something but I give it a 3 out of 5 to both wishes on to the next pair all right so these are the final parents we have we're just gonna kind of whip through Zetas sing the i-12 or the I my seventies in the ice same holes same ole same oh you'll need to test those out this looks like a computer mouse no joke it actually looks like a Magic Mouse I like those got a cool design little earbuds these are similar but slave I don't like this case just feels way too cheap yeah I don't like that but in this case like yeah that is is always this is nice this is like the upgraded version in this case right yeah it's the same one in here too yeah so you got you got white cheap black and more expensive black so let's give you try quickly look at the lights on these dude Wow look at them they're amazing alright got both of mine on now I'm gonna go with the a 6 LED a6z there's any markings on these do you have to stop oh I got it no I got it out of both ears so let me put this into bluetooth pairing mode by forcibly shoving them into my eardrums cuz that's what it feels like dude they need to figure out a way to pair these in a different way because like it hurts so much sounds pretty good like I'd pay $30 for these but they probably cost 5 no good got nothing here we'll just have to go from your phone no worries you listen to those I got these these are really clear like clear yeah what do you think I just don't know how they go in my ear though that's how they go in your ear feels like it's out of my ear I dropped them so on the white ones I'm gonna say wish 4 out of 5 they sound I'm sure good it sound pretty good I'd give him a 3 cuz I'm more stingy but sure I can't get these to play yeah let's try these these are cheap I wouldn't buy these fierce in Auto dish these are 10 bucks those are 10 dollars dang dude looking at these bad boys I feel like they're kind of got a USB port to charge your phone it's a good sign these were stripped charges microwork five extra dollars that's the question got a pretty nice case all right no bought your phone - they sound like yeah there's nobody done son so there's no button it's just touch capacitive so if you hold it down all of them just connected oh cool I'm not hearing it I had high hopes for these me too me too $15 man look at this case well that's a shame what's your dish unfortunately a dish they don't you know I mean idiot we didn't get him to work for us like 15 bucks they might work for you but I save your money after buying all the ear pods and ear pods on a wish Josh which is your favorite I mean you have to go with the ITEX these are like actually good these are heaters and they might actually charge the real air pods you guys have to let us know if they do but for $24 it's worth it that's it for another episode of wish Buster's makes you guys drop a like if you guys want more episodes and get subscribed if you're new and
