hey what's up guys welcome back to tech smart for a very different video so last week I went up to San Francisco to go check out LG's medical lounge big thanks to LG Display for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out the OLED space it'll be linked in the description but they got some doctors and some TVs and I had no idea what to expect alright guys so this entire video was basically LG Display putting two TVs into a room and being able to tell what the difference is between OLED from every other TV which is LCD and I have never seen both TVs side-by-side and a test that was not altered but truly the same connections same content same TV and it was pretty sweet to be able to tell so here's what happened [Music] so when we got there there were doctors dressed up in head-to-toe medical gear it actually looked like I was in a doctor's office and there were TVs all over so Oh ed stands for organic light-emitting diode and the big thing with OLED panels versus LCD panels is there's no backlight required meaning each pixel on an OLED panel stands alone can emit deeper blacks brighter whites and detail just looks crisper where LCD has a backlight it's pretty big and that's why TVs and phones only shrunken in size as Ã¶hlins been used it was sweet and then they called my name it was time had to go into the first room this was vision test for details so when I jumped into this room they blacked it off with the 4k OLED on the left and then the 8k LCD on the right and remember 8k has four times as many pixels as 4k so you'd think an 8k TV would look way better than a 4k TV no it's all about the panel OLED is way better than LCD so like it an eye doctor or an optometrist you get that text test where text is really big all the letters are big at the top and progressively they get smaller as you go down ultimately trying to test your vision and see if you're messed up or not I wear contacts they're super thick I'm pretty messed up so they hit me with that text and you're instantly able to tell this gray light kind of wall to backlight on the a K LCD versus the OLED TV is super sharp you can see the blacks you can see the whites and that's all you can see and then they really went for it they gave me a magnifying glass to go hold up to the TV and go tell the individual pixels were separated from the LCD and they hit me with a Sun or butt cheek and hit me with the Sun you're not supposed to look at the Sun but I looked at the Sun and it looks way better on the left than it does on the LCD which is the right and it was pretty sweet I'm telling you looking at a magnifying glass up close at a TV it's a dream come true I got to try now went to the second room vision test B and I'm already really insecure about these eyes because they're beautiful but they can't see for Jack so this was all about color and this was really cool so 4k oh that on the left 8k LCD on the right and they hit me with some whales in an ocean and like Shamu on the left are able to see the water it's blue the whales look white like a normal whale would look and then when you look at it on the LCD the ocean has this purplish effect now LG Display told me both of these TVs are running the same connection running the same content nothing was monkeyed around with except the panel on the LCD that's just how it was made and this was super cool to see because then they slapped some roses at me and they know I don't have a love life so at this point I'm like back what are you doing with the roses moving across the screen on the OLED all the color is consistent all the images look sharp through and through no matter how fast it's coming versus the LCD you're still able to tell this grayish hue around the image the roses don't look as good as they look on OLED you probably know that by now if it's not already clear and now on to the last test and let me know in the comments which was your favorite booth for me this is it and you're gonna see why so it's called CSO or Crystal sound OLED and this is where sound actually comes through the display and there is no speaker at all on the TV this was next level I have never seen this before I've only seen it in YouTube videos and online but this was rad so they let me touch the TV which if you're a tech guy like me that is a sin you don't touch the TV so I touch the TV and they threw this car drifting from left to right and you can feel the sound on the panel and that's all because of OLED and then when you cut to the back you see this panel is razor thin and well there's no backlight that's how they do it then they threw a bumblebee or I think it's like if you go to a movie you see the big intro that and you can feel it go up to the display I don't think in a movie theater anytime soon they're gonna be letting you put your hands on the screen but if they do it works with OLED and it feels and sounds perfect and you pick up a TV with CSO in the future you're not gonna need a sound bar for speakers it's all built in and that was really really cool not just see and like you're seeing it now but to feel and actually like hear it that was the coolest thing I have ever seen on a TV and I just want my TV to have it and really when you think about it why would you get a TV with an LCD it's 2019 backlight shouldn't exist your phone probably doesn't have one and if it does it's ok give it a year it's all gonna be OLED and with OLED it has three times less blue light so less eye strain and this is the coolest test ever side-by-side OLED first LCD and it doesn't matter how many pixels are in it if it's not OLED it's the highway so that was just a quick look at LG's medical lounge with their 4k OLED compared to an 8k LCD TV there's a night and day difference but that's gonna do it for this video if you guys made it to the end make sure to drop a like make sure you get subscribed for more and I'll catch you guys in the next one
