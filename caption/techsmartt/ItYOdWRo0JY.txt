earlier this week I saw this video on YouTube it came up in like my recommended section of this guy taking his iphone to Walmart and there's like a machine there that will buy your phone in any condition you have to answer a few questions and it looked like this talk the total devotion sue got me thinking how much would they give me for an iPhone time nears the fund right now so we're going to pick up this iPhone hopefully we actually get it and it's not a scale of even less than retail after just 10 days it doesn't make total sense once we get the phone we're gonna drive all the way to Compton where there's a special Walmart here I kid you not they had the Eco ATM machines hopefully we'll get some money for this iPhone 10 maybe 900 bucks maybe Borg do like the people on Craigslist they all wanted like 1300 1500 bucks for the phones like the fact that I could be maybe getting this phone for 900 bucks it's a steal got some money we got the funds let's hope this guy's legit it would really suck to drive all out here just to have to go right back home and it's such a good deal like my mom always said it's too good to be true it's probably too good to be true um I'm proving that one wrong today by Papa UE iPhone 10 for a song sounds going me so we're like two minutes away right now I'm excited do the set of 7-eleven that's the first alright I'm meeting the guy here he
