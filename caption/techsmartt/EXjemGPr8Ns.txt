whoa all right hey what's good guys Keaton here so right now we're heading to the Walmart that previously I shot a video at like two months ago basically if you missed a video I'll leave a link right up there if you did I took an iPhone 10 and I found this machine inside Walmart known as the ecoATM here is the legendary machine and basically this machine buys phones in any condition so if you have a crackphone you can put it in there and it will give you cash on the spot so it kind of got me thinking like it was November the iPhone 10 was probably like a week old at the time so basically how much would it give me for what is like a brand-new phone so when I posted this video I didn't really think much of it but you guys crushed it like crushing it so much I need to use two hands to show you all right and I got to get off on this exit hang on so what ended up happening is ecoATM actually reached out and they're actually sponsoring this video so basically I don't if you guys caught their whole press release kind of verifying the original video and verifying the phone what they did is they sent me the iPhone 10 the real one here that I chose to recycle in the machine when I put it in the machine and plugged it in it didn't actually give me any cash for it it couldn't determine a value and that was back then now that I have the same iPhone 10 actually works it's not the fake one we're gonna try to do that again can I make a right here does anyone know am I good all right well we're just gonna we're gonna gas it why you don't like keep driving so what better way to pass the time then to read some main YouTube comments I don't know if you guys check the video we'll check the like to dislike ratio but it was about what 50,000 likes to like 75,000 dislikes like something crazy and there were a lot of comments so let's read some text Mart more like text stupid AF come on I've heard more original comments like tech done with two bees would have been good that's awful like you can do better this one is from Joshi video fake check out is it real channel for proof well Joshi I got a question I saw the same is it real video I got the real one here because echo ATM senesin I've had the fake one since the video drop and I think I posted a picture on Twitter if you guys are following me I'm just techsmartt because I saw another comment some guy from like Miami said the video was the fakest thing he's ever seen but honestly like I'm gonna do an is it real on the is it real Channel the TOS swag says most punchable face on YouTube now what do you think the top reply to that was I agree yes no no no okay Jake ball yeah tape no way really where I was on Facebook this random page called special vehicle movers some random like European page or something

would at your local ATM we're gonna head cell device where you can just get an estimate and why this didn't work in the first one and you guys saw this in ecoATM press release but basically after a device comes out so the iPhone 10 came out on November 3rd you have to wait 60 days after that day until you can actually get a cash value at least from their machines I don't know if this is like a rule but that's what tripped me up in the first place and that's why the machines said no value for my eyeball done just said recycle is this is the iPhone 10 well later I don't know what language this is in if you know let me know in the comments all right so we got an English this is the real iPhone 10 I just want to set the record straight I have the fake one here put in my mouth for you
