welcome to another new series here on the channel this one's called wish Busters where I basically go on to this app called wish you haven't heard of it I'll leave it linked down below it's pretty much this super cheap version of Amazon where you can find things for $1 to $2 to sometimes even free like I kid you not the only catch is you have to wait like three to four weeks for things to actually ship to you and pretty much in that time you don't know if the item you're getting is good or if it's bad yeah there's reviews but in this series I'll be picking up five different items and ultimately telling you if something's cash or if it's trash and just help you figure out that's something you want to buy so let's jump on into the app right now pick out our five things let's see what's good alright it's everyone's favorite time to hop on into the wish app and see what we can find I didn't even know what to expect yo I was not expecting to see this on our first item three bucks it's got a lot of words let's read it here for Samsung no date haste clear acrylic critique coke coke we I don't want I don't want to say what I'm thinking for Samsung case note eight shockproof back cover for Galaxy Note 8 think we know us for the no date now unless there is oh [Applause] there's a brioche oh I'm falling down the trap again I'm falling up there is one review that's like a million phones there's a phone of yours in this fat list here Wow and they just swiped out of the app I love the iPhone time hey cellular phones for the iPhone 10 all right we got a case for free pick the red color hopefully he pulls through I don't even know so we're looking for item numero twoo right now is this a wireless charger that phone doesn't even support wireless charging that's an iPhone se there is no reviews let's slide in and related 50,000 people about this one looking a little better $2 we're saving cash and we're not even trying to save cash I subscribed very happy the product Luis sounds Gucci works great my ass ache that's a rhyme Curtis you're a rapper by default oh my god but this is who I am I'm just the rapper straight up Janell grandson will love it if the grandkids are gonna love it I'm gonna love it we're hitting by not even going through the photos black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow that's the color we are getting okay so this item just popped up it's a little pricey it's a $500 gas-powered scooter I don't know if I want to pick this up just because of how much it is drop a like on this video if this video hits 20,000 likes kind of big goal for you guys I will pick this up and we'll check it out in a future episode it looks sort of promising I don't even know if I can say it looks promising gas-powered scooter guys hike you here I hope we hit the scooter goal it's up to you guys let's see what else we can find that's not five hundred dollars whoa I just like randomly swipe down and I think I found something kind of interesting I've never seen this before it's a USB like a multi-port USB so you can plug in a bunch of different items but there's actually on/off switches for each port Kanna handy I don't really think it matters cuz you don't need to hit on or off but if you're having to pay for power and you just don't want to waste the charge this actually looks like a dope item looks good but haven't tried it yet Nivea girl why haven't we tried it yet can you try it and then write your review next time would appreciate you if there's one for free no there's one for $1 I'm gonna have to cop the one for $1 in it johner for your chip 10,000 people have bought it seems fine so far works great got her fast was a bit late but good sure $4 alright we're going a little overboard I got the seven core alright what else do we got on the wishes a USB external DVD combo and CD drive I don't actually have one of these right now if it works and it can read any movie or burn a CD or load up some software totally worth it looks good haven't hooked it up to my computer yet Shelley why write the rid of you huh Stephanie looks great haven't tried yet Stephanie can you just try the product please please before you write something this is why we're doing this series so we can test this stuff out before you might want to buy it because these people aren't testing it out and they're just saying Terkel buy it whoa guys look what I just found a head massager this guy looks like he's having a great time probably the time of his life look how happy this guy is look at that everything looks legit if it comes with a mannequin head greatest product ever need one of those needs to fit more snugly but very happy overall Helen with the good review there thank you for leaving a good one alright head massager is there anything cheaper we got one for 20 no I don't even want to go that route we're gonna play it safe Susan said it Debbie said it Helen said it all the girls said it we're gonna just buy this thing so just like that we got five items added into the cart not gonna lie this apps kind of addicting I didn't think I'd be putting five items in my cart every single video it's just happening alright let's go in the cart I think it's gonna be under 50 bucks I'm hoping it is I don't know what shipping is gonna be you guys know I do the Express shipping so oh I'm excited um oh yes 41 dollars well I'm feeling good shipping's more than the price that's okay let's order these up and wait alright so it's been about a month and everything has finally arrived from wish so the first thing that we're gonna be checking out is something that we actually got for free it showed up it's the red iPhone 10 case I was not expecting something for free to actually show up right or I think we paid shipping on this I'm pretty sure I paid shipping it's been so long I guess that's kind of the whole catch behind wish like you buy stuff you kind of forget it it shows up and hopefully it's pretty good from the looks it at this iPhone 10 case it doesn't look too bad let me take the $3.00 one off here and actually give this a shot is it fit yeah it fits you guys let me know in the comments how you feel about this case I would say it's definitely man Wow now is it gonna protect your phone if you drop it I'm gonna tell you right now that is a no there is no lay on the table protection the case doesn't come above the glass for free though I mean the case looks nice it's kind of like a nice red salmon it's a case I mean it's free you can't really complain do I even drop it it scares me every single time just be careful when you drop your phone I don't think it's gonna make the next thing that arrived was this seven port USB 2.0 power strip with variable switches so this caught my eye because normally you plug in a USB hub all the ports are on but with this you can control which ports are on which ports aren't kind of interesting it for three dollars and 80 cents if it works it's something new that I can add to my collection I don't own one of these what we need is more of course it works a flick the switches when you turn them on they emit a blue beam we also got a wireless charger now this wasn't something I was expecting to come without any defects and on the back you can see it looks warped like it looks warped if you smell it cuz that's what I do it smells like burnt plastic well of course it's gonna smell like burnt plastic but it smells like the minute someone plugged this in it started to eat away its plastic so I got this for a dollar ninety cents we're gonna plug this in and see if it wirelessly charges the iPhone 10 with the case on it the full circle here of all the products let's turn off all these other switches so we can give as much power to this wireless charger I cannot believe my eyes you just saw it for yourself there the wireless charger works the USB port hub works now it's not charging now it is charging like this can really come in handy if you want to focus your power towards a few of the ports maybe get a little bit more power from those ports I think it could actually be done with USB 2.0 it can be done so up until this point in the video we are three on items working from wish we have three caches so far so the next thing we picked up was this external DVD player cost 13 bucks currently my MacBook doesn't have a DVD player in awhile since this had one so let's give this a whirl I would love for this to work this might be the greatest buy on here all right come on out there we go there we go it's time to get the party started it's looking promising to ports we need two cords to make this thing go got em plugged in we're gonna plug them into the switch it's only fitting it's only fitting to see if it can handle it maybe the switch might not be a cash-in an adapter this into my MacBook Pro for some reason it's not objecting the disc tray there is a hole right there so I got a sim tool it works I see a DVD tray so what I did is I went to 7-eleven to buy a movie and fire this thing up we got jay-z's made America compared to me jay-z is lazy let's see if we can play jay-z's movie here alright slots on in I mean it doesn't feel too cheap it's definitely plastic but you have to sitting here for about 10 minutes the DVD has not shown up on my macbook pro don't know if there's something I'm doing wrong but the fact that the button doesn't even properly eject the disc from the DVD player I'm just following a trash some of these are gonna be winners some are gonna be losers the last thing that we ordered I don't know if you guys remember this but it was the head massager it's been so long since these items have shipped I kind of forgot that this might just cure all my problems easy brain massager look at that face look at that guy's face this guy looks like he's in heaven right now see what's good with this thing 23 bucks this cost me it's got an interesting smell to it nice fruit bag at the grocery so we got these pads here they're grooved so they really massage the head I'm just going to turn this on we got our on/off switch right there and that says USB that's not a USB that looks like an AC port barely and it just it fits on my head it feels pretty comfortable I didn't think it'd be this comfortable but do we just switch it on now oh I feel it yeah it's working it's working it's just like vibrations on my head you can turn it up we're at max massage table I got this thing on high it like just vibrates my neck and the top part of my head it's kind of nice like I can just go walk outside with this thing on Lucas happy is this guy like this head massager it works I'm feeling good I feel good right now and I'm wearing this on my next day so that's it for the
