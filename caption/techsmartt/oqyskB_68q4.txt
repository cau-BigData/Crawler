[Music] hey what's good guys welcome back tech smart for a really exciting video that I have been waiting to do forever so I've always had this kind of thing of wanting to go camping and if you guys didn't follow along I posted a picture on Instagram I'm just techsmartt and basically I said I wanted to do what kind of Halloween themed video you know it's October kind of spice it up I just boring tech videos inside and you guys actually voted to have us go camping with the team with the new LG gram and big thanks by the way to LG for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out the new LG gram I'll leave it linked down below the reason why this video is sweet though is the LG gram is a laptop I haven't actually checked out before so this is the 14 inch one and why this is so special is the all-day battery life and obviously when you almost drop it it's really durable and that was totally meant to happen since this is my first time checking out the LG gram honestly it's really thin so it's really sweet about this laptop versus some of the other ones that I own is you get tons of ports so on the side here you have the power port kind of interesting it's not USB but kind of nice cuz you know exactly where it is USB 3.0 port HDMI input then a USB C port which of course you need to have on any laptop nowadays and then on this side you have a Kensington lock USB 3.0 headphone jack in my favorite feature that is so underrated and you don't ever see it an SD card slot what we're gonna do is actually try to find a camping site I've never been really camping before I've tried but then I just go back in my car so we're doing a proper my LG grab is currently at 97 percent battery but what do you think it'll be by the end of the video photo Kanye car let's get spooky camping information California state parks I mean the campground looks pretty legit scrolling down just fine our V's are allowed here but have to be under 18 feet we're set it's only 12 bucks a night on Halloween whoa we actually woah dude have look at how beautiful that looks and I honestly think it's the LG grams screen those colors I want to see if we see that we need supplies though first or I'm gonna die in the forest I mean the laptop won't all day battery right right now we're on our way to Walmart real quick just to grab a few supplies I don't know what this whole camping thing is gonna do to me probably she's gonna get a tent sleeping bag maybe some firewood marshmallow that mean the team's coming with so I won't be alone but we're gonna have fun it's Halloween I mean as long as Freddy or Jason stop coming okay I'm actually like I'm an expert I have no idea what I'm doing so sleeping bag for sure some might say pillow topper I say yoga mat of course got to get it in when you're outdoors [Music] honestly I'm getting fired up going camping here wow that was just a mad pun huge fan of slushy guys wanna check out this song I'll link it in the playlist below it's just my weekly playlist PB jams massive fan of slushie but we are going through these canyons right now [Music] seriously the LG grab sign that slap got it right here not doing the whole laptop driving thing we're not making that happen in this video no but it's working its power in that Oxford right [Music] [Laughter] so the video is buffering still but one thing I can definitely tell you is the battery life is holding up that was the one thing I was really wanting to see about the LG gram is how good it is in the wild we haven't really put it to the test we kind of just got here we're at 92% and I've adjusted it to be almost near the best battery by setting 91% now all right full brightness because why wouldn't you you're out here the sun's pointed at your back and you're trying to enjoy yourself this cold weathers finally getting me we're outside finally finally finally we got the tents set up it's not the biggest tent but hey it's just for me all the teams leaving so that's all we need honestly surprised how hard it was to set up the tent given the YouTube video it looked way easier but hey here it is I'm feeling good we finally got some food it's cooking were Kremlin and chillin my man JD is billon I mean he said an expensive guy just hire him on the weekends as good photography oh yeah it's gonna get mad cold so we didn't have this fire it would suck but let's watch a movie it's time the night begins it's Halloween right I read yes we're gonna scare you at some point so the fire is the only thing keeping us alive right now we're actually gonna jump on Netflix a battery life for a quick update is 88% well too bad I actually toggled on the best performance cuz we're about to watch a movie I actually don't know with the reception if we're gonna be able to one other thing that I kind of just noticed was the LG Graham unlike a lot of other laptops that I've seen actually has a touchscreen and since it's Halloween what movie do we wanna watch I'm gonna give you three choices real quick three seconds give me your answer here we go The Shining babadook or The Sixth Sense Josh we're watching a shining retro here comes Johnny this is the definition of Netflix and chill Irene just went to the bathroom and since it's Halloween we all got to have some fun before we head out so we're gonna scare so battery life let's just do a real quick check and then we're getting out of here because it's so cold and I read made way too much noise so people are probably scared that we're doing some crazy stuff over here forty-nine percent so that's after an entire day's use a movie a car ride some music with slushie this has been the lg grams you guys knock it out again link down in the description that's it for this video I hope you guys had an
