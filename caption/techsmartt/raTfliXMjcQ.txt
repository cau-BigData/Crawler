hey what's good guys welcome back to tech smart for you classic video in this one we're taking all the earpods that we have and we're heading to the ecoATM to see if the new air pod to's actually get us any money or if we're just gonna stay broke forever or hold it I'm gonna give you guys the rundown here I got the whish air pods I have the I tends these have the USBC charge connector at the bottom interested to see what the ecoATM thinks of these we got of course the air pod tubes the reason you're here with wireless charging and we're gonna see if these actually get us some money we got the i7 mini these came from was it Walmart they are from Walmart if you guys missed that video right up there in the iCard these are $25 and then this pair right here isn't marked don't really know a whole lot they just say air pods they have a lightning connector so you guys know we're taking the air pods we're gonna get covered there and then from your comments you guys want me to take some whish gadgets so we got the wish tablet this is the only one that still works so I'm saving all the battery life for the machine the few other phones and a super rare throwback Apple product we're gonna see if the ecoATM gives it to us or if it does it you guys know how this works subscribe if you're new I'm nervous I don't know if I even want to leave the seat before jump in the car and get to selling some air pods and other gadgets big things to declutter for sponsoring this video and if you guys haven't heard of the clutter it's the fast and easy way to sell your phone or any gadgets right from home and that's the big game-changer because unlike us where we're having to drive out to an ATM just go sell stuff you can do this right from the site so a link will be down in the description all you have to do is jump on here and you can actually buy stuff we're start selling stuff and with sweet about declutter is the whole process is fast and really easy so let's sell my iPhone 6 plus and see how much we can actually get over 6 million people have sold stuff on here and the clutters paid out over three hundred million dollars so hopefully they got a little extra money for me iPhone 6 plus I got the 16 gig model and right there you see the tech price promise so the price you see 127 dollars or whatever you get for your gadget is the price you'll get paid so they'll send you how to label you ship it to them and once your phone arrives they're gonna wipe all your data so everything is secured and let's say you change your mind we'll ship your phone back and that's pretty sweet what's awesome about de-clutter is they pay up to 33% more than traditional carrier buyback programs so break the cycle sell through the clutter and you can do this all from your home just hit complete order accept terms and conditions just like that I sold my old iPhone six-plus for a hundred and twenty seven dollars let's see how much a gold iPhone are you kidding dude that's not right so on the clutter I priced this phone out before we did this video five hundred and eighty dollars three hundred fifty-five whether you're thinking about selling or upgrading make sure to hit the link in the description to go to declutter calm and use code tech smart 10 for 10 percent extra anything you sell that's right that's huge I wish we had that going on right now because I gotta go get in the car and drive to go sell some tech really we made in the car surprisingly no traffic but we time this one we're leaving it like lunch times but with your buds do I don't entirely know if we're gonna get something from ecoATM or fool recognize that I haven't put in a pair of ear pods yet so that's a big thing with this video and of course got the wish tablets we got the iPad Mini and then there's one of the random Android tablets gonna be interesting to see if we get some money for those remember what I said about no traffic I hope we get some money to justify the cost of sitting in traffic for probably two hours obviously I'm taking a bunch of stuff to the ecoATM to sell but with the air pods to you guys know I'm doing the largest giveaway ever right up there in the iCard can't necessarily point without putting my hand out the window giving away 10 you guys want them you got them we're gonna spice it up I've pull out some of the comments from the last ecoATM video with everything Apple Pro if you guys miss that one right up there in the iCard where we've sold an s10 and saw how much we could give for it I got the s10 here's we're gonna see if a month later it gives us anything let's get some comments going dude first comment is poop you could have recycled the tablets from a wish in the ecoATM we got the recycling machine and I hope and know we're getting at least a dollar for this at Gamestop you would get 250 including the car a Gamestop I get two of dollars and fifty cents including the car let's just flip it next comment is please plug itto ATM to ecoATM si Italia and we can do that somehow build a cable join those two together we might have a resurrection of some phone we haven't even heard of seen couldn't iPod in the machine put an iPod in the machine that's a good idea only we had in an iPod oh we got a go we made it we're good nobody hey that was everything Apple Pro and me we cracked that phone together yeah it might have been a little unreleased at five minutes Bennett was techrax you commented on the photo to Rasta comment that was it it's common is I genuinely love your videos but some of them just makes my bank account cry some of them make my bank account cry typed in Lakewood cuz that's where we went for the last ecoATM video and it brought us to wrong Lakewood mall that's my fault how far are we of a minute I can live with that we're near a Lakewood Plaza but I'm looking at the tag here that's where we should be we're 5 miles we are close but another 12 minutes away this is gonna be the last one we had to have gone on the wrong entrance there is an eco ATM in there and we have to find it we are right back where we started finally made it so first we're gonna sell the wish and the Walmart earpods just be ii7 let's see what we can get so hopefully 'z have micro USB but I say it's all other phones and it's unlocked we're just gonna see if the air pots get recognized put a label on it if you like it then you should have put a label on it place your phone oh you just put it down it's gonna try to get a recommendation that's crazy it doesn't even give us a tip for some reason I haven't even put my ID in usual stuff I feel like you do in the first place sorry I can't buy your phone okay so probably not gonna work with these air pods we're just gonna rule that out we're gonna get rid of that idea we're gonna try to see if we can sell the air pods to just keep in mind I got a few other products got a rare Apple retro products that hopefully the machine will take but we'll see what scrapping price it now it's unlocked what if your air pirates were on a carrier is in there see if they start charging whoa they start to charge okay tap trust my screen doesn't really work creig's anyway well this is embarrassing okay so air pods don't work we're ruling out the air pod category let's get something that will work the s10 II samsung smartphone writes it now this one was unlocked it works it's good it's USB type-c all right this film retailed for $750 competes with the iPhone 10 our let's see how much we get it's connected to the notifications panel so is it not working but it's not really working it does make sure the cable to charger are properly connected never seen that before what happens okay that's ND doesn't work doesn't work the iPad Mini first-generation from the wish tablets video with cord you guys missed that one right up there in the iCard this has gotta work something here's got to work we're selling a tablet we've never done this before on any ecoATM video desperate times call for desperate measures we go that cable looks that could be with doing us on dude the cable looks like it's like proper shot I got unlock it to charge it here we go I disabled the iPad why too many passcode attempts pretty sure Corey set this one up so a layman Corey libary but I don't know what you did with the iPad we are not selling this one today we can't make the video a fail we're gonna do the wish Android tablet and then we're moving on to an iPhone 10s yeah we're trying to sell we're trying to sell his phone these are all ours how much those are the those are from Walmart I'm not gonna lie they're not very good oh man I might have a wireless charging pair there you go boss they charge with us PC and they'll go wireless charge and they look like air pods do they look exactly the same so we just handed some air pods off to the security guy outside deep gentlemen let's hope we get something for the looks like an iPad smells a good iPad but it has a connector at the top so it's not an iPad hold your way it turns what is that gonna pull up as Josh a Samsung a Motorola it's not working so if you ever see me ever come ask for a photo I don't bite and chances are I'll give you a pair of ear buds let's see how much a gold iPhone ecoATM sync up to five hundred and forty dollars I'm gonna jump over onto clutter and see how much this goes for remember I had just show up to the small give some guys free pair of ear pods you don't have to do that on declutter so Apple iPhone Grayson now this one's also unlocked let's see if the machine can recognize the case $50 value the low low price of give me at least five ten dollars here we go Josh how much do you think the EQ ATM is gonna give us up to five hundred forty dollars boom Russ probably like 500 probably 500 okay this can happen if your device has a case on it here we go pricing the iPhone 10s max without a case because that does not work I'd be shocked if he gives us a price we did have some good hope though on the first drive dude those cables loops what is that an iPod Touch the first iPod Touch whoa with the 30-pin connector that's sick do I think I'm getting $540 probably not are you kidding dude that's not right so on the clutter I priced this phone out before we did this video five hundred and eighty dollars three hundred fifty five might be the last equate the end video should we sell it heck no we're gonna see what the iPod Touch gets us then we're getting out of here we gotta say the iPod Touch is unlocked but we're not too sure it works just turn it on it's pretty good 30-pin and let's see see how much we get dude I've never seen a 30 pin connector unplug and replug it's probably cuz he's dead right so right behind us right now two security guards alright iPod touch doesn't work it's probably good wait oh my my Mon I thought you lost so we just came out from the ecoATM and what kind of happened was we tried to sell the Walmart earpods the wish air pods regular air pods do an iPad Mini a wish tablet and an iPod Touch and nothing really sold or got a price on it except the iPhone tennis max so I think it was something up with a cable I don't know if you guys will see that on your ecoATM experiences but we also had security kind of come near us to get to give a pair of ear pods out the eye tens so guys that's it for this video if you guys liked it make
