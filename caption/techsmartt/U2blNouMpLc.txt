hey what's good guys welcome back to tech smart for an unexpected video you guys know the air pods - just dropped in if you haven't been following the air pods trend there's been a ton of videos on the channel if you've been subscribed these have been out since late 2016 Apple unexpectedly just refresh the air pods held no event or anything so if you're one of those people that got air pods for the holidays and felt really cool and special how broke do you really feel now so probably panicking in your seat right now I'm thinking how much do these cost what's in them what's Apple trying to pull it's only been a few months since I got these don't worry I'm giving away 10 pairs of the air pods to videos right if they're in the iCard if you want to check it out I'll leave it linked down below super easy to enter and it's open for two weeks but with the air pods - what's new are a few things I mean air pods one are here just diving on into the box and no it doesn't say - on it I just wrote that with the Sharpie just so I can keep my own head straight they look alike same kind of lightning cable in the Box no USB see charging so the air pod stood the only thing that's really new is the wireless charging case that you can see an Apple actually released three new versions so this is the $199 air pods - that's how much they cost but there is $159 version without the wireless charging case so it's still the same improved sound on the air pods and then there's a $79 wireless charging case so no air pods but what you can do is take the case that you spend $79 on it's crazy and use your old ear pods if you haven't lost it you now have a brand new case and what's even crazier I know I keep saying that word is Apple's no longer selling the air pod it's not even for $100 $50 oh no no these are so hot there's no refurbished there's no discounted version which would have been a good move but obviously these are so hot so the two is just what they're good I have so many questions for the air pods - already but what's new so we finally have a series support so everyone can finally be a robot and just talking to Siri to talk to their friends even if they're right next to them so all you have to do with air pods - in your ear is just say hey Siri and it activates kind of sup the new and cool you didn't have on the air pots first-gen and the twos have the new h1 ship compared to the first generation which only has the w1 ship these offer 30% less latency so if you're into gaming on your iPhone or any Apple device actually these work with other phones than just iPhones so if you're gaming in general that's definitely gonna be a noticeable improvement and these have 50% faster connecting time so if you're one of those air pods users pretty much set their I know for me that's always been somewhat of an issue sometimes they pair with the w1 but now with the h1 be interesting to see if I lose them or if they stay connected we can looking at both the air pods 1st gen case and the 2nd gen is really anything new no all there really is is a charging led right on the front it seems like apples been watching all the videos on techsmartt has been following all the clones it's nice they finally put the charging icon right on the front so you can see when your air pods are charging especially because of the qi wireless charging this year which we'll check out in a second other than that the case weighs slightly more noting where it's unbearable and still lightning on the bottom opening them up here do the air pods to look different at all compared to the version ones I of course have a cozy on here if you guys miss the free air pod tricks video that's right up in the iCard but just looking at the gen one here versus the second gen on my right it almost looks like the second gen is slightly thinner but no no they are exactly the same even the connector at the bottom yeah it's the exact same nothing else really changed microphone spots right about the same and it's also really good to see that if you do have any of these cozies on your air pods because there's no coding or anything extra to make it stay in your ear they haven't changed the design at all nothing extra on they kind of fall out I mean they're the same air pod so it's good to see what the cozies when you put them in your ear pods to case or if you just pick up the wireless charging case a little bit a little bit of friction but they still miss the work so vote up in the iCard if you guys are gonna be picking up the air pods to what's tripping us out tests that's really why we're here right it doesn't sound good it's not worth it but of course you guys know I did a video with the Galaxy buds comparing them to the air pots to for the ultimate showdown on techsmartt - if you want to check it out right up there in the iCard but let's just get right to it so I'm gonna put the air pods - and it's gonna remain in my right ear for this entire video boom it just connected to the phone and then on my left ear I have the first gen air pods you guys know what's going on just two headphones we're gonna listen to three songs so kicking it into the playlist and you guys want to check out the full set of PB James playlists I'll leave them linked down below they come out every single Friday on YouTube music Apple music Spotify whatever's clever we're at max on both phones so the first song we're gonna be checking out is slushies self-destruct it's got some pianos it's EDM there's a massive bass drop gonna hit play at the same time alright I got it yes I love when that happens you can sync it up that's how we used to make speakers back in my day okay alright starts out with pianos what I can instantly hear is it's clear on the air pods - it's less muddy yeah things just seem a little clearer on the air pods - she just sounds clear there's a robot voice in this song self-destruct protocol has been activated I gotta hear the bass drop alright for sure you can hear a difference with the second gen over the first gen it's a little clearer than notes and I just say any lyrics sounds smoother all the vocals you can hear everything anyone saying weird but crazy good next up is Logix new albums supermarket I got Bohemian trap City queued up it's one of my favorite songs let me know in the comments if you guys have listened to it or what you're into right now here we go three two one oh I nailed it again can I go three for three so we start off with the synth I really like it it definitely sounds more balanced on the second gen so job well done you're paying $199 for these you're gonna be happy yeah wow this is this does it I'm speechless it's really rare that I don't always have something to say right it's not night and day different where I want to throw the first away or it makes sense why Apple stop selling them but feel like I'm really shouting but I don't care I like this song like I'm a big Bluetooth earphones guy you guys know I love the galaxy buds I like the first gen air pods I love the air pod clones I can't get enough of them this is just giving me something new to like look for and it just sounds like it's there all right we're going on to the third song for the last song and I'm so excited to check these out on the galaxy buds and just see which sounds better for the price I mean 199 dollars versus 129 not really comparison there but here we go third song is now you're gone with Tom Walker and Zara Larsson love this Jam I didn't get it three two one nailed it okay this is this is probably the clearest test yet Tom feels a little bit more faded on the first gen okay now Zara's coming in it sounds balanced it just sounds more balanced on the second gen improve sound a little bit more balanced a little clearer I will say the first gen sounds louder though but bass is definitely more polished I'm running out of words to say it's improved and it's smoother alright I think I got it the first jet air pod sound like you're in a little bit more of like a concert like setting that slight echo but the second gen just have the polish and the balance and of course the feature that I don't know if I'm gonna totally use or if you'll use but it now works hey Siri and you just say uh-huh every time actually hey Siri that I gotta change it I got it it does work on the earpods too and if you finally want to let go of your real assistance and just move to the virtual assistant thanks Siri on the air pods two years ago hey Siri take some notes for me how am I feeling with you that was really deep still trying to get over that it works the last thing of course with the air pods - is the wireless charging so with the LED notifier on the front it's pretty easy and this is just a wireless charger I like I'll leave a link down in the description it's grown on me and there are four USB ports yeah four USB ports kinda hard to see you of USBC at the bottom - not bad so when you drop your ear pods on or your device lights up red to let you know that you are charging and then of course the wireless charger lets you know it's charging so pretty simple it's not rocket science but you're thinking I have to pay $79 just to get the wireless charging case from Apple of course not it's tech smart so there is a lookalike wireless charging case that works with any pair of air pods you drop in and they still have that kind of white enamel finish so it's kind of a fake way to get their size comparison you can tell your air pods are bigger how else would they fit they're like some wish air buds right you guys miss josh and i grabbing all the wish air pods right up there in the iCard that's the final plug so $15 that white enamel finish I mean it looks like air pots if you hold them back and then if you get really close to someone they're gonna notice you have a pretty sweet case and it wirelessly charges and you didn't spend $79.00 like everyone at Apple wanted you to but you let me know so are the air pods - worth it if you haven't picked up a pair of ear pods this is really your only chance I mean you don't want the wireless charging it's one hundred and fifty nine dollars if you do it's one hundred ninety-nine and they definitely sound better and I'm excited to see how the battery life lasts if it's actually 24 hours or not keep you guys posted on Twitter it's just tech smart as for the regular air pods this is really fair well you got to pick up the case now cuz everyone's gonna be talking about wireless charging so $199 you battle it out in the comments and tell me if it's worth it and that's gonna do it for this video if you guys are new make sure to drop a thumbs if you enjoyed subscribe if you're new and join too for some extra perks and some extra bonus content throughout the month it's all popping and I'll catch you guys next
