so you guys know I'm a huge fan of the Black Friday deals and especially the cyber monday deals but what's interesting is you can actually get some stuff for free on Black Friday so drop a comment down below you guys find any other free steals for Black Friday and let's get saving do see you guys know I posted all these free Black Friday deals over on my Twitter I'll leave a link down below just in case you guys want to check them out after this video goes up and how this goes down is when you pay for this item obviously you got to spend some money out-of-pocket first you actually will send in a mail-in rebate and then in total you were spending $0 so all this stuff on this list is free and first things first our craziest deal yet this with Bass Pro Shop they're giving away two hundred free Santa fidgets spinners to the first two hundred people in line they're giving away two hundred your boy had a thousand run don't walk you gotta get no I'm just kidding like don't I wouldn't even get out of bed for this one for real though Game Stop is probably the best deal in this entire video and vote up in the iCard which you think is the best deal from this video so normally an x-box 360 egg gamer stop goes for a hundred and nine bucks I know can't stop you like that it goes for a hundred nine bucks but for Black Friday they're doing a deal for sixty bucks you can get an Xbox 360 out the door which already is a good deal you can throw it at your college dorm at home the 360 is still a good council and your boy respects smart but with the $60 mail-in rebate you're getting an Xbox 360 for free most you guys probably have an Xbox one X or a One S or hell even a ps4 so first three you're getting a 360 that's amazing like no chunk the rest of these deals go down at a place called fries let me know in the comments if you guys have heard of fries before I know it's only in like a few states it's awesome I went there last year so the first thing is in a soos router for 30 bucks and what's dope about this is it has smart detection so once you take this thing out of the box within 30 seconds you'll be ready to go like I kind of want to see if that actually works for free like spend 30 then and the mail-in rebate in your coming out a winner who doesn't want to be a win they also got two pairs of Bluetooth earbuds one going for 15 bucks which is kind of like your normal style earbuds and the one going for 20 bucks it's kind of like these next style Bluetooth earbuds you guys have seen him before and I don't let you guys but I lose my earbuds all the time so for free you're getting hooked up you could just throw them in a drawer once you send that rebate in you're gonna be chillin aces actually has another thing on this list it's a $15.00 Bluetooth adapter what you're getting for free so this is good if your keyboard or computer doesn't actually have bluetooth out of the box you can plug this USB in control your stuff via bluetooth and everyone's connected that and speaking of Bluetooth there's a Bluetooth receiver for 25 bucks but today it's free and what's cool about this is to say you have a speaker back there you got an old pair of speakers they're probably not gonna have bluetooth in them so you just plug this thing in with a normal headphone jack and it turns them Bluetooth or so you got a pair headphones they're not bluetooth BAM now the Bluetooth nexif is a five port fast charging USB hub it normally goes for 30 bucks today it is free and honestly since you're picking up a free potentially fast charging USB strip why not try like this one right here I had to pay for it I thought I was gonna break it like no joke I said I was probably gonna break it I didn't actually break it I had to pay for that one you're getting it for free why not this next one I don't even know what to tell you guys it's a pair of gaming earbuds for 12 bucks it's free but let's just hold up a second who wears gaming ear but I don't think I've ever seen a gamer wearing earbuds before besides listening just music like I'm pretty sure phase yachty isn't messing with these gaming gear but maybe the next big thing I don't know face smart rocking the earbuds like no it's just it doesn't sound so those are all the tech deals going on and I know this isn't a correlated but Tilly's the clothing store they're kind of having a pretty cool deal with the iPhone 10 right now so if you stand in line for Black Friday some random person and lines not only gonna get a $500 Tilly's gift card but another person is gonna get a brand new iPhone 10 it's not tech related but if you're looking to cop some clothes and you're already in line maybe you'll get an iPhone 10 that's it for this video make sure you get subscribed and you
