hey guys welcome back to techsmartt and this phone right in front of me is called the xiaomi polka phone f1o if you guys don't check it out links down below and think makes a xiaomi for sponsoring this video here we go to polka phone it's brand new this year it's got a unique name it's actually called the poco phone f1 and this is the global version so this is actually gonna be a phone at Wharf budget-friendly but the good news is for 430 bucks that's the most expensive one you're gonna get the armored Edition some super diggin the yellow yellow and blue my favorite colors so I'm pumped here let's check out sue we get oh wait what use your manual in a case I like that as a freebie getting a free case you can't complain no one's complaining about that and then this right here is the poco phone f1 armored Edition and you see what I'm seeing right now for the first time there's carbon fiber on the back and I don't know about you guys seriously let me know in the comments how you feel about it but this thing looks mad sexy right but of course it couldn't be a phone without a power brick and a USBC cable basic it works it charges oh sweet so this thing's run an Oreo 8.1 dang I almost kind of like the me UI I've checked out another Xiaomi phone like last year I love that now me me mix - you guys have probably seen that it feels amazing having a six inch bezel this display like the only real bezel on here's at the 5 of course of course we gotta just test out the gaming so there's a liquid-cooled pack in here which is supposed to keep the phone completely cool why our gaming using it it's never gonna get hot so I'm gonna put that to the test and I wanna start off by playing pub G you know it's the game that I'm good at I'm still trying to get better at fortnight but on mobile I actually get kills and I want to see how hot this thing gets and it tested I got a laser thermometer so I'm gonna heat this thing up get some chicken dinners and then we're gonna measure it hopefully this chicken dinner is pretty cool so I'm gonna try to make contact where I'm guessing the CPU and GPU are in the middle somewhere let's just hit that right in the center and you guys can see the phone's temperature right now is 81.4 degrees Fahrenheit just try this out man dude it just it looks really good colors I mean you guys be the judge of it let me know in the comments how you feel about this it looks accurate it doesn't look overblown oversaturated good all right we're gonna play classic I don't want a squad I want to be solo I mean I've checked out a lot of phones and I play pub G a lot this is the only one I can shoot with that it looks good nothing's lagging I can't tell any distortion any stuttering I'm just running to the house I'm at full sprint I can see everything things are just loading up now in the distance no I said it was good oh yeah we got him he's down with that liquid cooling technology on the back here I know my hands are getting a little sweaty I'm getting pumped but those days are completely cool my hands just naturally sweat that's kind of Who I am but the phone isn't getting hot and I'm kind of shocked just usually with pub G on any phone it gets hot it starts to work the graphics card CPU so I'm almost like ten minutes in the audrina 6:30 and the Snapdragon a 45 I don't know what they're doing but I'm not having a problem no lag I can hear everything I think I'm coming up on my second enemy so if I get to kill you no it's good and I hope I do because I should have died I shouldn't even be around right now the first guy just sucked so here we go after playing around like 10 minutes of pub G getting one kill see how hot this thing is and I know my hands were touching it and you're sweating so you know that I know that this thing's like thirty degrees hotter you know something's up but I don't think it will be it's pretty cool so like 87 degrees so of course the phone gets a little warm I can't feel it though I don't know if the liquid cool technology is just working perfectly but no joke I could not feel the phone getting maybe I got to play some more pub G but after 10 minutes phone's staying cool so the phone that I got here goes for 430 bucks let me tell you what specs this thing's rocking the 8 gigs of ram 256 gigabytes of storage an adrenal 630 GPU is a four thousand milliamp hour battery so basically this should get you all day where your day might be a little different than mine I'm a power user and I can tell you I can't burn through four thousand milliamp hours in this phone it really feels kind of comfy not too heavy not too light it just feels sturdy so on the back you can't see what I'm seeing and I like this and I know you do too you see these red accent marks just on the lenses here so on the back is a 12 megapixel dual autofocus lens with an AI dual camera I want to test that out I wanna see what that's really about it looks good I like these red accent marks and I wish more companies did this because it looks SoDo gonna be high quality don't take your selfies we're gonna test that out so the front of this phone it's got a pretty big display it doesn't feel too huge in my hands it's like it's a manageable size where I feel large and in charge but I don't have a brick I'm carrying around it's 1080p panel so I'm guessing it's gonna look pretty sharp I don't even know how to feel about her I'm Way more surprised than I was expecting seeing this thing online and in photos leaked I showed you guys on Twitter I didn't think it would feel this good so on the front is a 6.1 inch displays a 1080p display so I really want to see how that looks and colors I'm pumped on the bottom we got dual speakers USB C to charge it and the side looks like there's some dedicated button there I don't know if that's like a voice assistant or just a camera shutter check that out volume buttons how cookie are these pretty clicky so as you guys can probably tell already there is a notch and to be totally honest it's not a notch that I hate it doesn't look that bad me it's a little large but you have your speaker at the top cameras your set I mean this screen is what's drawing my attention right now it looks really good colors look super crisp app icons look crisp everything just looks good like no pixelation no distortion it just looks good as you guys probably know there's a few other options of this so if you don't want to get the armored one the flagship one that starts at around like 400 bucks 8 gigs of ram still 256 gigs of storage so either you like this or you don't but I think you're gonna if you're doing more than just gaming or watching videos come and check out our next pop YouTube the tech smart video it looks really good colors I mean you guys be the judge you let me know in the comments and vote if they're in the iCard if you guys like the f1 or if you don't it's a pretty good price what you get like I am so shocked I didn't even think videos we're gonna low it I think it'd be a little laggy it's been perfect no lag it looks true to color like you find in a laptop or a desktop videos look good audio sounds good let's check out this camera I mean really this phones a banger picks on the back five megapixel here and then 20 on the front buzu very easy UI here you know what you want to get into whether it's a square photo a portrait a video or short video what's a short video how long is a short video okay let's try this out so I'm testing out this way what a short video is like 10 seconds so what you could do is you can actually upload this like snapchat or Instagram stories whatever you want to do so the front-facing camera it looks pretty good video looks good on the phone sharpness is down so things kind of seem a little bit more smoothed out I like that but now I want to test out the background because this could be a game-changer if the front looks good but I want to see the back on the f1 there's some video so I will say it almost looks a little edited can I even tell this is low Sharps high sharpness she's trying to see the detail starting to grow a beard everything right and then low sharpness you can see there's just more smooth edges out on my face yeah it's a little spicy in here you can tell things are getting hot I think I'm gonna keep low sharpness on it just looks a little more natural the edges look a little bit more smoothed out maybe medium but you can change it all right now let's check out the back handles you know the red accents you can see there's a cab around here they're accessing it I want to see if you can change the settings on the rear camera like you can on the front guessing you can oh that's kind of cool so you actually have an included beauty mode on the back Group selfie settings and tweak everything sharpness saturation contrast you can really customize this to get the exact shot you want hey yo Josh we're going to museum later today got my first work of art so the polka phone f1 the most surprising phone I have honestly checked out in 2018 for 230 bucks you can get the armored edition the carbon fiber the 12 megapixel the five megapixel camera 6.1 inch screen 1080p resolution specs cool or six-thirty GPU octa-core 845 Snapdragon 4000 million power battery so you're gonna be set all day and of course it comes with Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 so this thing is gonna charge it fast it's gonna be fast it's gonna stay cool with the liquid cool tech I'm not joking I tested this out I would tell you if there was something I didn't like you guys know that about me and there's not one thing I guess the only thing is I wish it came in like a red because red carbon oh if you want to check out the focus on f1 links in the
