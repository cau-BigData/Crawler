so I've been checking out a bunch of stuff on eBay recently and I came across this thing called a mystery box drop a link in this video if you guys have heard of this weird invention basically people just put a bunch of random items in a box they put a price on it they throw it on eBay and you don't know what you're getting so half the time you could be getting something way overvalued from like the price you're paying or just absolute crap so this is kind of a new idea that I came up with I found three mystery boxes at three different price points we're gonna buy them check them out and see what kind of think we get what's kind of crazy is in the eBay Terms of Service this is actually not allowed this is considered a banned video because you can't sell someone a product online without them knowing what they're getting if that makes sense so we're out here trapping we're doing the bad legal stuff so I got three mystery boxes here oh the first one is at 15 bucks do not buy if you don't want this is tech related items in it are you brave enough to buy this and then that's the sellers name okay is there anything else in the description no all right let's scroll it's from Illinois shoutouts all my illinois peeps 21 feedback 5 stars like i don't know if i'm trust in that he seems like he's a trustworthy dude let's hit Add to Cart oh we got $100 mystery box this one's different from a new seller tech gadgets iPhone Android computer headphones SmartWatch now that entices me that probably entices you to all items are perfectly functional perfectly functional that means that it could be a used item could have a bunch of scratches on it there's one of the person watching that could be us there's only one available and the worst part is you can make an offer on all these boxes but how much how much feedback does this dude have from LA okay so we'll probably get it soon 78 feedback I trust it I trusted it a little more let me know in the comments right now if you think we're gonna get a bunch of crap or some actual tech I'm so skeptical this is the first time I've actually tried this let's jump into 250 bucks see this is where it gets interesting this is why I actually want to spend 250 bucks three surprise box I like a surprise Samsung Galaxy phone or other electronics guaranteed now I'm willing to take the risk because they hooked me on with the Samsung Galaxy phone that'd be dope if we got a new si I'd love that maybe we're all whores and dreamers out here hopefully the description says Samsung Galaxy phone or other electronics guaranteed that's a back guarantee if you're asking me all used but in great working condition all AT&T carrier understand this is as is no returns the fact that he put AT&T in there tells me where we might be get enough phone hopefully don't don't rip me off who's the seller oh it's from Missouri i-17 feedback we're probably getting scammed look we are probably getting scammed let's hit Add to Cart okay so we got them all in cart here $250 $100 won $15 one grand total comes out to 374 bucks are we gonna get 374 dollars worth of tech or gadgets I really hope so let's hit checkout I'm getting pumped I'm paying pop for it cool so just like that we place the order now let's wait for all the mystery boxes to arrive let's see what we get so it's been about a week and all three mystery boxes have a ride we got our $50 $100 one and the $250 one I just wrote on them just so I know and just so you guys know which is which now the $15 one kind of has an interesting story the other two came no problem everything was good with the sellers but as soon as I bought the $15 one and it's the one we'll check out first uh you may actually messaged me it was like hold up dude don't send the money if the money's already been sent it's fine hopefully you'll get your box will back you up but as soon as I bought this the listing just disappeared like it was one of those sketchy posts and eBay was like do just be careful so here's a 15 dollar one I don't know what to expect I kind of forgot once he's listening said so we're just gonna be surprised it's like 15 bucks with $3 shipping all right this is looking promising this is really looking promising I think we got more than $15 worth of stuff so we got this VR headset is this is this a used VR headset I own the exact same one from the dollar store and it goes for five dollars so we're already coming out with five dollars worth of stuff that's so janky that is so janky I'll try this out in a sec let's see what else we got some Xbox 360 games yes you know I have an xbox I love my 360 madden 11 mw3 play two copies of mw3 so we got one of the discs for Forza 4 the content install this I think we're good let me know in the comments if you guys have an xbox or a ps4 we got a disc scratched uh not too bad MW literally like why why why throw it in there why why do this to me ah alright what is this yo what is this a bouncy ball some headphones with tinfoil on the side I get why it's a $15 mystery box like I can't even get mad dude how long were these headphones used for like I gotta wipe these down with some Clorox wipes the loudness of these headphones is probably like a 1 out of 10 I see why it's in a mystery box I mean these look like a good pair of headphones in their prime but I think they're way past their prime the $15 box is pretty disappointing so let's try out the hundred dollar one hopefully we got some better stuff that isn't too used oh I'm feeling optimistic is that a seal game this person went all out I know this is what we got a pop socket it's just good vibes that's actually useful brand new I think we got a brand new movie ok what else another VR headset I'm good Sundance Film Festival it's a Google cardboard the bra oh that's kind of cool what's in here no way whoa whoa whoa a Google ho mini this is brand new I don't even have one of these yo a detachable USB see USB a cable I'm digging this I'm digging this guy a battery pack wait this is it fast charging up anchor like this reputable brand it's got fast charging on there too whoa I think that's a battery it's not a battery pack it looks like it's just a wall plug with four extra USB s another USB seat a USB a cable some binoculars heck yeah got up and they work they work really well you go check that out those cable the charge of the battery pack and then another USBC cable I'm actually excited to continue doing more of these drop alike and you guys want another one Wow pop socket binoculars a movie a battery pack we definitely got more than $100 with this stuff at least I feel that way all right so real quick here's the deal so I showed you guys the 250 dollar mystery box all three mystery boxes but I don't know where the clip is of me actually opening the box this is what we got we got two Galaxy Note 4's a Galaxy Tab 3 with LTE and then two OtterBox cases I think eBay must have broke into the studio hacked into my laptop and deleted that clip since the whole mystery box thing is against the Terms of Service here's what we got let's go charge them up and see if they work I don't think they'll work so we got two out of the three devices charged up the note 4 in the middle is chilling it works I've been on it a little bit it's a note for what can you expect this phone's a little old so what's cool about the note 4 is it was the last note to have a removable back kind of a nice feature you don't see this anymore you don't even have the official batteries we got a gold knockoff battery I mean hey it does the job the phone's power and on so I guess that's better than the white one here basically I got it to turn on and then it just kept going through boom oops and it's no longer turning on S Pen comes in here so it's kind of chill it works but I mean I'm pretty happy that we got to note fours and a Galaxy Tab 3 so the Galaxy Tab 3 I've never seen one of these in my life and what's interesting is as the old YouTube app on here so I don't know how long this tablet has been offline or hasn't been updated for interesting and this is the cellular model so I'm guessing when they bought the note fours if they bought like two that's why I have the note four it's like they obviously didn't want them they got a free Galaxy Tab 3 so for 250 bucks with everything that we got I need some OtterBox cases and apparently it didn't protect one of the note 4 as well enough because it doesn't work I would say I'm not disappointed and what's interesting is if you go on eBay right now and you just look up what a note 4 is going for it's going for a hundred and forty bucks I'll refurbish Bob for spending 250 bucks on a mystery box we got some OtterBox cases I mean these are always gonna have value a Galaxy Tab 3 that works a note for that works and then I'm gonna say half of a note 4 so like a note 2 I'm not disappointed like this was amazing that's gonna do it for this video make
