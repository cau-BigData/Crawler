it's happening your parents are probably gonna bring it up right after this video I know they're subscribed so you today's is this site they actually reached out and respond Tsering this video that kind of keeps the balance when you're going back to school and you're looking to pick up some new gear whether that's tech food lifestyle beauty health and fitness and fashion so you can find anything you want so here's the deal it keeps the entire balance it's basically a discount hub you save up to 50% on brands like Apple Logitech sign Heiser like real brands so we're gonna do what we do best we're gonna hop on you today's check out the tech section and pick up some gadgets that are gonna be super useful you might even be curious about them for the back-to-school season and we're gonna save some money and before we of course get started I want to give it back to you guys so I'm gonna give away $500 to Yoona days and you only have to do is comment down below with how you spend it I'm gonna be looking for someone that actually needs it and Bale here we go Apple you get the free beats as usual 10% off using Microsoft sir okay I'm just gonna go right into that I really want to pick up a surface book this year get a surface pro 128 gigabyte SSD a gigabytes of RAM they knocked it down through saving 360 bucks ad it's a card all right let's go into TV and audio if you don't like some new speakers well this logitech got 25% off heard good things about the MX audio so fire ad promo code you ready for this Oh 25% off so that brought us down from $100 $75 telling you I'm here for

code this is just so simple so I just save 20 bucks all right another thing that I want to pick up was a good Logitech keyboard so I know I could spend like 300 dollars getting a sick mechanical keyboard thrown something functional that is it my MacBook because it's cutting into my wrist Josh is basically dying over there a cricket that's chirping is not happy either so picking up a keyboard is good and it comes to the mouse it's a combo gotta love that add that thing to cart you'll see it in a sec so another thing that I was just thinking is I got this wireless mouse and keyboard combo but I want to pick up a second mouse and just see if there's any difference oh just just treat yourself here so if you're into anything that is creative video editing photo design illustrator get a nice screen to see all your photos one that has better color accuracy I'm not saying this was the best on the market but I'm saying for the price you can't beat it so adding that to the cart then you guys know having a serious pair of headphones is needed air pods are cool but you know what's even cooler having something that you can actually enjoy sine Heiser you know they make good stuff I'm gonna hit by on this and just like that seven back to school products roared once that I'm kind of into checkout ones that are actually deals for you guys so everything will be linked down below if you want to check it out the only thing left to do is wait till these things get here and then we'll test it out so unlike wish or any other series on this channel that you guys probably have seen if you haven't right up there in the iCard this actually took like three days to come so super easy and I'm not gonna unbox everything here I'm sure you guys don't want to see what the box of a speaker looks like you just want to see how it actually works how it sounds and if it's worth the deal and the only thing that I actually want to check out an unbox and give it a fair shot is the surface pro I've never seen one of these before I know I'm a little a sweet okay this feels really awesome or to be honest it looks like a Macbook box the type cover so this clicks into the bottom it's kind of a one style what else do you get I know this isn't it it's how you charge it that's I'm gonna act like I'm interested in this sick dude basically like the same wait isn't an iPad pro twelve point nine inch definitely on some heft but it's also on the full-fledged computer so I'm gonna dock this for the first time it's my first dock here oh and because the surface you got the stand so you have a USB port on the side Thunderbolt or DisplayPort right there like that charge for it right there and then headphone jack right at the top ooh I am excited how long is this gonna take the startup oh I love the touch screen the touch screen it actually works it doesn't feel like it's gonna fall off but a for a laptop like I said if you're doing basic photo and video editing I think you could be set and of course the only other thing that I actually want a box before just having everything set up so these MX sound speakers they caught my eye I see what these are about oh wow these are way bigger than the picture these look at that have some basin logitech's pretty much known for audio whoa is getting really loud the bass comes from here and here and these are bluetooth you guys let me know what you think I think these are solid especially with the deal you get an aux option then you get bluetooth and it can do two devices so this right here is the total setup we got the UE speaker we have the MX sounds cooler speakers nice comfy keyboard that isn't gonna break the bank surface pro and a pretty sweet 27-inch monitor that will fit your dorm room and of course you can't forget be the mouse happy actually picked this mouse up so this is what it looks like this is the setup that's really what it's about here so you want to check it out again link down below so I'm assuming that
