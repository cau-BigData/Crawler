nope what's up guys oh I sound like a little kid more than usual so right now I am super stoked I'm so stoked about this I just raced here to the post office because the tracking number updated for me basically I've been waiting two months for this package to come it's a Ferrari made iPhone case but how this is different you know because it's gotta be if there is a certain feature that I have never seen before on any iPhone cases can hit it smells really good why did I just snow my finger like that oh yeah you should've been there really that's not how I do things I'm at my post office right now let's go on inside and see what's good two months ago on eBay leave it like down below if you guys want to check it out BAM let's go I gotta open this up love you know in the comments you guys have heard of this thing you don't even know that's right you gotta keep watching from Harare it's my Honda we called the Ferrari to Ferrari let's go dang cars locked what do you do love this post office I was actually thinking about doing like a P o box series where you guys send me weird tax anything you guys find and I'll open it up you guys just gotta send me some stuff there's the P o box address right there if enough you guys send me packages I'll make it a serious maybe you launched it on like Facebook or Twitter you know who knows so here's a package I'm really excited there's only one thing left to do dude I waited two months for this oh yeah oh yeah this is it can you guys see this now I've done a few videos on phone case just cool phone cases before I did one that looks like a gun one that's brass knuckles I'll leave those link right up there in the iCard this is a Ferrari iPhone case the catch is the secret feature is it dispenses cologne or perfume that's right you know that that nice smell Ferraris have now you have it in Cologne coming out of your iPhone case it works for the iPhone 6 and 6s they did make a 7 or a 10 version fragrance spray protect that's all you want is a Ferrari owner right now I gotta open this up we just keep it up Wow dude this looks like the bay pipe okay so you guys missed that video I'll leave a link right up there same kind of style case no way no freakin way and then here is the Cologne Scuderia Ferrari I took Italian in high school for four years so I think I got that right so you just put that up to the iPhone case and you read gas it that doesn't smell too bad so to refill this I think you just pull up on oh wow I'm a mess but I think I got it so right in there is the nozzle where you fill this up so basically you just tilt it like this squeeze and it will put Cologne in here you see the hole on this top piece which looks like the protector weight now it makes sense take that top piece off you pour it in fills up when you want Cologne to come out it was my first time doing that car smells like a Ferrari now it is the Harare my mouth tastes like a Ferrari I guess it was wrong on how you actually refill this thing it's actually done on the inside portion of the case so there's this tab here pull this off and bam there you have it you have the Cologne pouch it's basically liquid inside an iPhone case do you think you'd be able to fly with this like I think it's yet 25 milliliters when your stuff goes through that scanner and they see some liquid moving where your phone is I don't think it's gonna work out too well for you you just switch out these pouches when you're done that's so much cologne you're set for a year maybe two maybe until the next iPhone 10 comes out I am I'm in love like this is the greatest case ever we're back in my place now and you guys know like back in middle school high school if you used to hold a flame up to like axe Cologne you could get a flame thrower now that we had that in an iPhone case I want to see if it's flammable I'm guessing it probably is this is now the Ferrari flamethrower case if this works got the mist all right here we go oh wow that that burned my hand a little bit I'm probably not gonna have any hairs I don't have hair to begin with on my arm but nope we got a flamethrower Elon Musk watch out hello I'm Elon Musk last up I had to bring it home we're outside the Beverly Hills Ferrari dealership right now I'd love to go inside but I don't think they'd like that very much that just kind of seems like the Ferrari thing hey if
