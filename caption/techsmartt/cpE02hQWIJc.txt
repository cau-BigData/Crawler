hey with you guys system a context smart for a pretty classic episode of you probably this is ABS actually first time doing one of these everyone's first time right of how bad is it basically where I take a real and a fake version of a brand new smartphone this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 this thing just came out I don't even know if you guys have checked it out let me know in the comments if you have or head up your local Best Buy but basically fakes exists so if you want to pick one of these up typically you can get one used for like 100 or 200 bucks off you might get fooled so in this video I'm gonna be showing you guys a brand-new fake Galaxy Note 9 for me real one which one do you guys think it is let me know right up in the comments is it number one or number two here we go have are you ready so here we go so basically this series works where I show you guys a real version and a fake Galaxy Note 9 and no I didn't just give it away number one and number two case you guys have not voted in the iCard let me know in the comments if you guys got it right or maybe just slap a like on it this video typically always pops off you guys love this series if you guys missed that 125 dollar fake iPhone 10 how bad is it it's right up there in the iCard check out a fake iphone 10 before it really even came out so here we go real burst fake which one is it this is the fake one and this is the real one so this year the s-pen is actually redesigned in its MV box so with the note 9 and I got the purple one right here this doesn't have a colored S Pen so that's one thing to look for if you got a purple one it's gonna be a purple S Pen included and one thing that you're gonna know boom you can't even put it in the wrong way that's that's a gimme right there so S Pen on the front on this one you might think it's real and what's crazy is they try to make these boxes in advance this is what the picture might look like but you know this is the real one so before we open these guys up let's look at deep back to the box because that's always a huge thing so on the real one at the 128 gigabyte model with 6 gigabytes of brand you can get a 512 gigabyte one with 8 gigs of RAM that's the upgraded one Matt expensive this year so just get ready for that it's a thousand bucks for this one and 1,250 bucks thousand two hundred and fifty for the more expensive eight gig at 512 models so the fake one here actually cost me this one was actually 95 bucks in what's inside is 16 gigs of just storage not 128 gigs and one gigabyte of RAM you know what it's about 1900 million power battery versus on the real one four thousand milliamp hours octa core Snapdragon 845 I don't know we're gonna run a Geekbench at the end of the video and stay tuned for that let's just open this thing on the box it says six gigs of RAM 64 gigabytes of memory that's not even a model it's only 128 gigabytes and 512 so that's a first catch that you guys can pick up on 6.3 it should be a six point four inch display all right I'm done pointing it out let's just open up the real one EV here you go you guess this one you got it right I think I've probably no I think I'd put these on the table before the video at the bottom I actually bought this at Best Buy that's why there's a sticker it might fool you if there might be a sticker on yours but not one on them the fake real one they're trying to give you open this up so we got galaxy note 9 right there so this is where you might be getting fooled note 9 there's not really a space in between there and it even shows it on the real box but we'll look for that on the fake one in a sec open this up it's a sim tool at the front should be some paperwork but manuals you get in here quick reference guide eV and then the terms and conditions alright pretty basic and boom I got the sexy blue 1f damn 128 gigs oh I haven't even seen the blue one yet this looks fly I don't know if anyone heard that oars into that she's leading up to a moment there ooh alright that looks really good BAM I love the purple one too kind of happy to get the black blues kind of more of my color so for accessories USB to USB C connector so an adapter USB C to USB a just want to plug anything in wall charger this is fast charging guys no headphones those AKG headphones that's something to keep note and this kind of almost rope-like cable check these out for a sec ooh these actually look a little bit better than apples kind of something to note AKG okay that's actually a pair of headphones so the cable included USB hu USB see you guys know pretty basic some ear tips and then some sort of pin sure I've never but new with these are for AB what do you think this is it's like I always wanted to figure this out so we're about to find out boom could be for something like inspector wait what was that game surgeon there we go oh you knew that before I knew that drop that comment if you've ever played surgeon am I right or am I wrong you've ever played surgeon operation that's why I was there I've knows better than idea half the time and so that's everything in the real note 9 box damn this hole looks really good oh wow alright and now for the fake galaxy note 9 so again on the box no space what is this about there just should be an S Pen so maybe that might change there's cost me about 85 bucks I'll leave a link down below if you want to pick up a real note 9 or a fake note 9 I don't know why you want to buy a fake but hey might be better it might actually be somewhat decent that's kind of what you find out in the series so Samsung Galaxy Note 9 on the top of the box 64 gigabytes I don't know what that's about it's said on line 16 I should have to pay extra for that you can actually get one for 8 gigabytes that's less I don't know how you can live with that on the back dual pixel so camera seems fine I mean 64 okay if this thing's actually water and dust resistant IP 860 certified I would be shocked I might even just put it in a glass of water and see if it can last so here we go slides up like the other one Samsung on the bottom this should actually make some sense should have like that SSID the IMEI I just got the color black of mine alright so here is whoa we've got an Olympic version I believe what is it what is SH stand for super hot like Galaxy Note 9 you guys looking at this like whoa on the back it's black it's almost like they were covering up the Samsung logo whoa ah and then I mean it's a phone hey it's a phone it's a fake phone I don't know which one weighs more this one has more features in it and it should weigh more the real note 9 the fake one which is black so fake is black REO is blue so you guys know if you need the colors and Wow just look at the back on those so font is way less noticeable on the real one and then on the fake one it's just it's just on there what is that fingerprint reader dude that's like that's an indent that's like a full-on indent whoa that's like a um a crater or something geez okay let's see what else comes in the box how well would your Craigslist seller go to sell this phone open up the QuickStart guide okay this looks like it was actually printed okay power brick I wouldn't trust this this even feels yeah that even smells burnt that's I didn't even laugh really yes really put the power adapter up to your nose while you're buying this phone out of Starbucks if it smells burnt it probably is sim tool and then a cable another a two USB C so pretty basic what you'd expect in the box but men that didn't even work so you didn't even get an adapter you're not getting that adapter you know it's a fake if you get the phone and you look at the fingerprint reader and it actually looks like a crater like if it doesn't really feel like it blends in with the phone and you can like feel it like my fingers actually getting caught it's like so the real note 9 there should be two 12 megapixel cameras and there is because it's real on the fake I don't even know what there's packing it looks like there is two cameras yeah a flash what looks to be like a heartrate monitor and then that insanely really big fingerprint reader I had to pay extra for it there's actually ones where it's not included so galaxy note 9 is really on the back just sketching Gus versus versus on the real one made a glass so plastic that's glass let's see what the buttons are about oh I think there is so you have a dedicated button on the side that's for Bigsby I want to check out what fake fixed fees like and the volume buttons then on the right side of the phone you have your power button at the top SIM card and I'm gonna see if there's a micro SD for expandable storage on here I'm guessing maybe I read something about that maybe that's the 64 gigs of referencing at the bottom USB see headphone s-pen what is the big s-pen about no way does he even come out if it's like properly stuck in there you see if I can fish it out whoa that's how you know if the s-pen you can't just easily pull it out that's how you know well there goes half the note I mean now it's just a galaxy so real one turns on fake when I see a screen so Android is starting you don't get that obnoxious white screen on this now you do it's a different white screen and yes it's a little bit larger but but it takes you to the whole setup so I gotta set the real note 9 up and I've done this has done a few videos on the note 9 the right up there in the iCard ooh this just feels really strange says there's a bunch of messages on here what does this mean I think it's some carrier info whoa ah dude that's crazy it's not the red Gatorade that's almost drank there was a sim card oh I've never had that whoa someone knew that I was getting his phone so here both note 9 side by side is there a difference in hand I want to see the fake phone almost feels a little heavier than the real phone that's kind of weird to be expected usually the cheaper stuff actually weighs more than the good stuff sits lot on the top and on both microSD expansion so that exists what's this mystery button on the side Bixby there's a fake Bixby on the fake phone but gotta update Bixby on the real one makes me why are you updated get it together you just shipped could you spot you so this just takes me to Google assistant that's just like what everyone wanted boom alright so that's kind of interesting everything else looks kind of decent it's nice though to have a real S Pen because s-pen remote is a new feature this year I mean you can just take photos with your S Pen now so speaking of F it's photo time my boy here we go so there are two 12 megapixel cameras on here variable apertures a new feature with the new note 9 so it can go up to F 1.5 lots of lights coming in and then on the second lens up to F 2.4 F time to remake that same pose for the viewers it looks like it's almost like a Nexus 5 weird it's like really like super googly and the front-facing camera is just stupid good 8 megapixel camera good like ooh so when you compare them I mean you guys can compare them you guys can see you guys let me know in the comments which you like better the real or the fake this is just for you guys to know if you buy a phone on Craigslist eBay whatever test this stuff out immediately and then call if you guys did get scammed start Bixby and it just takes me to Google assistant really and I'm even on Wi-Fi interesting interesting interesting dude it's the same interface is that the one plus it's like oxygen OS I totally see it you guys be the judge maybe this is just me but the bezels like they're hella thick compared to the real one-year bezels aren't supposed to be that big that's a chin that's a proper double chin on the fake phone the real one really tiny black bar bezel at the top even thicker at the top wow they didn't even come close on this fake this is totally a oneplus device here's how I know when I go to the volume button I hit volume down it gives me none priority or all pretty sure that's on oneplus one two three they always have the notifier switch and you love it you have to love it but it's not on this phone there's no switch okay so we're gonna play a video I'm just done freaking out this is the real note 9 this is the fake it's a 720p display versus a quad HD one so let's listen to them really tinny on the fake one on the real wood it's much more like gold so colors actually don't look all that bad very interesting Before we jump into the benchmarks and see what the fake note nines actually packing and that's the final test you can do that on any deal that'll tell you if it's a real or fake device here's the score to look for but let's test out these fingerprint readers and see if they even works on the fake phone they moved it down on the new note 9 this year so instead of it being next to the camera it's actually underneath it so much more convenient you won't be hitting the camera lens anytime you put it on the back so much nicer good job Samsung fingerprints draw an unlock pattern alright you guys know the password now continue one more time create fingerprint whoa it works out but it doesn't even like show or pulse that you're on the sensor all right show all notification content let's see if this works I know what's gonna work on the note 9 so I'm gonna try to reset up the finger per reader look at the phone it's not even the right phone dude there's like an actual button it's rounded it's not even shaped like a rectangle on the note 9 you'd think he would try to at least get the details right am i right place the finger on the back of the center of the sensing area it's a lot of herbs all right I got it see this unlock so there is a fingerprint reader on here I don't even know what these phones are doing anymore whoa it led me in Wow I think I just had to retry it and do a better test yeah that works trying to hold it with the other hand boom we're in so when I set up my fingerprint on the real note 9 notice that it's a circle and you have to swipe your finger down alright so here we go we're gonna test out both fingerprints and see which is better wow that took way longer on the fake phone I'm a real one it's just so sensitive it's what you would expect and what you honestly paid for it all right this is kind of interesting so we're in the final part of the video where we Geekbench it and this reveals all fire up this app have the person that you're buying a phone from download it this is gonna tell you the software that it should be running and the one that it shouldn't it kind of gives you the whole breakdown in structure of the phone so it's gonna tell you the specs of the phone this is an octa-core processor so eight total cores octa like a spider come on guys you got it Charlotte's Web come on you know so the real fun you should have a total of eight cores so am i right here snapdragon 845 claw couple up to 2.8 gigahertz then on the fake phone it says there should be eight cores but one of the cores is running at 0 gigahertz so that that's a not that that's a fake core that's a not core there's no core there then the other ones running at 3 gigahertz so really interested to see what kind of power the fake phones packing really should be kind of an interesting shakedown so the fake phone on my left is running Android 7.0 nougat versus Oreo that should tell all right there if it's not running 8.1 you know it's a fake phone so let's run the cpu benchmark on both these see what scores we get you're gonna know what score to look for on the real one and that's all you guys gotta care about right off to the start this thing's running we're 5% on the fake phone it's still figuring out life we're at zero 11% Wow real no 9 is just trucking and I'm just commentating like this is a sports race here we go on the right pocket here we go we got the 17% on the note 9 note 9 at 19% 0% still on the what is life fake note 9 the real know 9 is just crushing it as you would expect you're shelling out a minimum of a thousand bucks maybe even 1250 if you're getting really spicy eight gigs of RAM boom that phone's gonna crush it might even be done if you pay that extra cash it's a powerful song perfect fine nail this water bottle flip you're buying me lunch oh my gosh he did it first try you all saw it while we're mid benchmark 17% on the fake phone 66 on the real 1f now owes me a lunch so the real new nine is done multi-core score is eighty nine hundred single chorus almost 25 so 2400 that's what you have to look for I almost have to cut this this videos getting way too long props if you guys made it drop a like if you are real one maybe get subscribed if you guys haven't we're gonna wait till this thing finishes it's basically a one plus two alright so all the benchmarks are done the fake note 9 honestly this thing took 20 minutes to do the real one took less than like three so here's a breakdown of the scores it's pretty revealing this is all you need to do and this will tell you everything you need to know if you have a fake phone or if you are encountering a real phone you can go ahead and give him the money it's a real phone you're all good to go don't worry he's a good guy so the fake phone you have a single core score of 404 and a multi-core score of a thousand and fourteen that is so telling of how bad is it that's how bad it is like that is record bad I've never seen a phone look so good on the outside perform so well and that just goes to show you where we're at in 2018 I mean this is kind of a budget phone am i right like 85 bucks to get you a fake note 9 so if you were to pick up the fake note 9 and you the daily my guess is you'd actually be able to use it if you want a powerhouse obviously you're gonna put the real deal and it costs about ten times more thousand bucks justyou can get started with the note 9 series that's it for how bad is it the fake note 9 how bad is it not that bad do you guys enjoyed this video make sure to drop a like and click subscribe by hitting that circle button if you guys want more videos like this and make sure to check out
