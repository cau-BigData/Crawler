last video if we hit a light goal of 25,000 likes I'd spend $2,000 on mystery boxes in this video but since we came so close we hit 17,000 I'm only gonna spend 5,000 maybe $1,700 to drop a like if we hit 25,000 lights again I'll give to you one more time I'll spend $10,000 on mystery boxes okay let's do it for real the first one six dollars I can't do anything with the six dollar mystery box I'm

whoa now I only lost $94 on this box what else do we hit Oh another key I see these you're kind of cool so you can wrap your earbuds around it and then you wrap your cable just kind of keeps everything a little more organized because let's face it a single cable or a single pair of headphones can get tangled so quickly kind of cool go grab some headphones I think this is my first candle and a mystery box appreciate you so this is kind of cool basically you take your cubed adapter that comes with your iPhone plug your cable in here make sure it doesn't pop out and then you wrap the excess cable just around beside here and what's dope is a silicone swings on down keeps your cable nice and organized and you charge your phone and what's cool is you still got access to the prongs
