welcome back to another episode of impulse buys so in case you guys are new to the series basically I have five minutes in an unlimited budget to go into different stores like Walmart Target Best Buy and see what kind of tech they got I'm looking for the cool stuff nothing cheap like stuff that you probably haven't heard of before so right now we're outside a Best Buy and quickly vote up in the iCard which store you guys want us to hit next and just a quick rundown on Best Buy basically they hate us building they I've tried this so many times they're not gonna let this happen so we're gonna jump over to the iPhone as soon as we get in store and hopefully we don't get kicked out and I tried to sit Fry's like last week it went really well I'll leave a link down below if you guys missed that episode they were super chill we found some really great stuff Bret Best Buy it's time to do it onward normally I'm running by now keep the phone down drop a like if we actually pull this off boys there's no shot there's no shot this is our first item here I saw your average consumer do a video on this above really interesting so gender is soldier boy let's try this and keeping our voices down I'm not running it oh my god what some tablets yeah got a $49 tablet down here weeks kind of sketch I don't know if there's a keyboard included we're not gonna take a chance I'm grabbing the Galaxy Tab Ely is it the e light the elite 337 let's go oh yeah this is pretty trill it's true and real right here it's a battery pack kind of interesting because it has a massive land to build let's keep this later there's an iPhone case an iPhone 10 case don't come on down here there's an employee looking at us it's in ziplock bag and they're selling it for 33 bucks yes can I make it the car eat this can I make in the cart you have the worst throw ever how much time you got we have two minutes 14 seconds left it's a leather iPhone case also a little use Missy if they can knock a few bucks off to the boys I'm not paying $40 for that show our number two here we there we go here we go here jeez dad and my fairness in my defense it's like a half card it's a shortcut you know pretty well I've not got kicked out no one's looked at us nor said alright the last thing that we need here how much time we left in a minute we're doing great tile you guys know I love these things they made a sport version which lasts like two times longer it's waterproof we'll check it out for ourselves to see if it's legit we got our items you might have a car get out yet where's the party 38 seconds later I could have had in the kingdom we finesse this best by the best by finessing you gotta make it we gotta make it we got a lot of most narrow aisles that 42 seconds might take out this baby we made it and suspend Banesto store an S is what we got so we're back from Best Buy somehow we made it back and actually pulled this video on I spent four hundred and sixty seven dollars not too bad we actually got some pretty nice swag this is everything we grabbed the first thing that I want to check out is the Galaxy Tab E light I think it's called the alley key light like you can't do that to your boy so the Galaxy Tab key like cost me 70 bucks it's interesting I mean we got something kind of interesting to look at here so let's see what we get and what the specs are seven inch screen 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor we'll get ramped 8 gigabytes of on-board storage and a 2 megapixel rear camera it's what you'd expect for like a $70 forget I mean you can't really expect too much here it's a pretty nice tablet alright let's try to jump into like Chrome and see how good this is can we quickly test this out see if we can load up like a YouTube video you can definitely tell that it's not an HD screen it feels pretty nice not super cheap I like this textured backing I remember when Samsung used to do this they don't do it on the new Note series anymore or the Galaxy S line I like it buttons on the side you could definitely one-hand this literally can't even play a video on YouTube because the Wi-Fi here is that bad alright well we try to load up YouTube it looks good from like the home screen side of things this is really what we have to compare because there's no Wi-Fi in this office my hotspot is not even working Wow it is just a rough day it's a really rough day like nothing is loading here so chrome looks all right I need $70 tablet not too bad next up is something that I'm pretty hyped about it's the tile spork so I actually have a tile on my keys show you guys I've been using one I think since I picked this up in like a weird shopping video if you haven't checked it out I'll leave it right up there in the iCard super sweet so these have actually been really helpful in just finding my keys basically it's like a GPS tracker that has an app you can kind of see where your stuff gets lost and if it does get lost outside the Bluetooth radius you can mark it as lost and anyone else that has a tile that walks on by they can help you find your lost stuff that's kind of the whole premise behind tile so what's cool about the tiles sport over like your regular tile is that comes with two times the rain and it's actually waterproof and it just looks and feels thinner so that's always a plus I kind of like that alright so this is the tile I mean it comes with an app if you guys haven't already seen this so there's an app on iOS and Android just to keep track of all your tiles really all your stuff so let's fire this up and you guys can see that I got a few tiles all set up I got one for now D I got one for the Honda Civic love that car I've been one for my wallet and actually the phone you're using is also in tile so for example I could just double tap on the tile and it's gonna ring your phone you'll be able to find your phone and the phone using is always gonna be at the bottom so say for example I wanted to find my keys so this is what I have the tile set at I would just go into the fine section here and it would start playing a loud noise for the tile so it's on your keys you'll be able to find it and it's a very distinct noise to where your ears are gonna recognize this just trust me on that and what's cool is you can actually switch up the ringtone and the volume of your tile just in case it's too loud you can control that all in the settings so just edit title details BAM you can change your photo your ringtone - for 60 bucks I'm a big fan of them I've been using them for a while and I think they're pretty worth it now the next thing we grabbed at Best Buy I couldn't believe I thought it was a prank like no joke thought someone just took this thing put it in a ziploc and threw a price tag on it but it's the Kate Spade iPhone 10 case I don't know how I've never seen this ever in my life at a best fight they just put this back in a ziploc bag and shout out to them for also marking it down from $40 to $33 but a sandwich baggie so I guess it's your standard iPhone 10 case like okay alright alright it's not like a nice hard shell on there TPU on the side so it's gonna it's gonna grip your iPhone time pretty well the real test though is gonna be when we drop testing to see if a sandwich baggie iPhone case will actually protect your phone yeah I don't know what this case is totally me I mean the case that I just had on my phone was from the $3.00 iPhone 10 case video if you want to check that out I'll leave it right up there in the iCard nothing just like that I know the phone screens not even gonna be cracked watch it crack I mean I think that case was sick this I think I like the sandwich baggie more than I like the actual case there's only one thing left to do let's head out in the hall and drop test it I'm not feeling good about this one here we go with the Kate Spade iPhone in case here goes nothing still the same iPhone 10 you guys know it's real don't worry about it like it might crack I think it's gonna crack dropping in 3 2 okay this is gonna be like the lunchroom oh wow okay alright alright just got a little bit of dirt it's got the lip on here so when you drop now I'm really pumped to check out the big-ticket item now one of the other things that we got was a battery pack that had a pretty substantial torch on the front like this is a lot of LEDs more LEDs than I usually see on these battery packs but eight thousand milliamp hour battery 384 lumens worth of light coming from this flashlight so it's not only a battery pack it's a flashlight I didn't read much when I was at Best Buy cuz I thought they were gonna kick us out one and two like I only had five minutes but there's actually a solar panel on the back it's kind of cool now use a few solar like hats to try to charge up an iPhone and a few other solar battery packs and in my experience it takes forever to charge something back up to a hundred percent just using the Sun now if you're out in the woods you know and you gotta live off the grid this is a good option but I don't think I'll be using the solar feature too much so there's two USB ports on the side and you guys wanna check out anything mentioned in this video I'll leave it linked down below I think I forgot to say that but you guys know where it always is how whole Wow Wow I mean you see how bright that is then the strobe effect going on if you get lost in the woods you need to find your way home I mean it's solid charges up your devices to battery indicator on the side let's see if it works the light shining bright we got the titanium iPhone 10 Judith BAM just like that your phone's charging and you're definitely not gonna get lost that's not usually like me to pick up two iPhone 10 cases in the same impulse buy but this one really caught my eyes so it's a partial leather partial plastic case is made by a company called nomads they got a reputation for making good quality products so let's go ahead and check this out I mean for 40 bucks it's so cool this is nice this is why I picked it up this seems like something gez would you I can see gez with this iPhone it's like being straight up watch this GQ interview I really liked it so the cool thing about having like this leather patch on the back is it's gonna wear with time it's gotta be better than that capes main case yo I liked it like first impressions it's got this frosted edge clear back so you can see a camera you can see what's good on the top and then this partial like leather section I'm taking it like I'm really digging it I think this is gonna protect my iPhone let me know in the comments right now yes or no if you think this case will protect my iPhone from a drop but you know what time it is let's head out in the hall and give it a test so the first type of case made it just fine let's try out the G easy one that's what I'm calling this Nomad case partial leather looks pretty good still the same real here we go dropping in three two one [Applause] [Music] dude maybe it's just cuz the light but we're good not broken at all backside since we got that leather patch we don't actually know if the bottom is broken not we're good and finally the item I am most excited to check out you guys probably - it's these Star Wars Jedi challenges they are headsets so saw your average consumer actually check this out and I wanted it from the start it was the most expensive item at Best Buy cost me like 199 bucks but let's see if it's sweet she's like the box so what you get inside the lightsaber controller the AR headset and then the tracking beacon here pretty generic stuff alright so I actually went ahead and set this up just in case I failed or anything like that can't be failing on camera you guys know you guys didn't give me so much crap if I do so to set this up you need to go ahead and download the Jedi challenge of app so once you have that installed and pretty much in terms of like phone sizes the iPhone 8 plus will barely fit in here it looks like it's just gonna fit but anything larger than this will not fit any in terms of thickness I would say like most phones like Samsung phones are gonna be totally fine just don't get anything too thick it's not gonna fit in this shell here so once you have the app all downloaded you can see what is connected and what isn't so our lightsaber here we need to flip this on the bottom charges via microUSB and you can see the lightsaber is good to go through the button here and then it button here we're all paired there let's do the calibration we got to do the Infinity motion we're all calibrated sweets and make sure the beacon his record batteries place the beacon on the floor we're gonna place it right there just so you guys can see it so a quick little preview just before I put the phone and you can see the black box in which when I put my phone down it's gonna reflect onto these mirrors and kind of give you that AR experience so let's try that out hey our screen goes down there then we need that cable so they have a few different cables they include this one's just for the iPhone that in I click I'm so excited to try this set up was pretty easy I'm not gonna lie alright so it looks like we're good I don't know if you guys can see that you can see the screen I can see my face here showing right there put this on I know AR it especially virtual reality are one of those things you actually have to try so maybe going over to your local Best Buy see what's good there and see if they'll let you try one let's give us a whirl all right what do I see it's really clear definitely try this out at Best Buy if you guys can seeing the planets now we can start fighting Naboo it's really well done actually I was so skeptical for like tooter bucks it looks cool let's let's actually get into a game wow this is awesome like you guys really gotta check this out it's so hard to explain I'm trying to show you what's going on right now so basically you guys can see I mean it's so hard I have a lot away I'm trying they're gonna kill me Lenovo crush this what BAM victory The Mirage AR headset it's actually really solid Jedi challenges
