maybe with you guys look heck techsmartt for the video I've been waiting to make hoping to make and I'm about to make so you guys have heard of the iPhone 10 ours been a few videos in the channel and gonna drop tests to flame-throwing test even a scratch so that's like Friday the 13th keep going you guys are missed those get subscribe so you don't or just check them out in the iCard right up there the iPhone 10 are though has been a phone that has continued to surprise me every single day I have used it if you can make a phone at the right price and offer the right specs and kind of right selling point I'm all for it and that's what the iPhone 10 are it's a key why are you riding the iPhone 10 are so hard and that's a really good question for me it's a few things it's the price it's the specs it's the timing and honestly it's the color so right in front of me I have the two iPhone xrs I have been loving the 10r the XR we're just gonna go between both because we can write having up to six colors to pick from honestly is refreshing I hope more phone companies do this in a 1 plus is super big into it I know Samsung is with making some of their custom Marvel editions and I think they're fun and if you can release them on launch date and give everyone the chance to pick them up that's awesome and that's really why I chose the yellow 10 R as my daily driver and that really goes into the whole price the 10 R starts at seven hundred and fifty dollars think about that for a sec with the iPhone 10 s as I'm almost about to do a drop test the iPhone 10s starts at $1,000 and then the 10s max with the new 6.5 inch screen starts at 11:30 so let's just break this down here are the phones that Apple is selling this year on the right we have the tennis then the tennis max in the center and then the ten are each with kind of a few different specs and honestly just a whole refresh there's nothing groundbreaking on the 10s and 10's max in my opinion I think it really shines on the 10r and here's where it gets spicy for 750 1100 and a thousand dollars which phone are you gonna want to pick one that has the same camera as all the other expensive phones the same chip and processor the a 12 in all three phones face ID in all three phones it really is of why are you spending more money when you have something with a 6.1 inch screen its larger than the iPhone 10 and 2017 its larger than the iPhone 10's for me 6.1 inches is that perfect screen size and honestly I can't wait for this to be OLED the panel is gonna look amazing in the price when in time and in the future I could see them keeping this at 750 bucks and basically recycling all the great features in the 10s Macs in about a year's time if it's in something that costs 750 bucks I'm all for it and what's amazing is because I saved two hundred and fifty dollars by not getting the 10s or 350 with the 10s max I could now spend that money on cases wireless chargers cuz all three phones have it or what I could do is actually get a 128 gigabyte iPhone 10 R for only 50 bucks more that's right you've heard it it is time to say it Apple the killers are the headphone jack the inventors are the knotch whatever you want to call them they finally are coming to their senses on more of a budget but not budget phone for 50 bucks more you can double the storage at purchase right then and there that means for 800 bucks you're getting a phone you could basically use for two maybe three years and the reason why the 10r is such a big deal whether you might love it or hate it or even believe it this phones for the people that have iPhone 6s --is that's right the ones that were on the 5s didn't want to get the six wanted to wait got the 6s and then haven't done anything since there's a lot of you out there if you're there trap a comment a bunch you guys are my friends in real life and I love seeing the successes they're still chugging hard but now you have a 10 R and this thing has the same specs as sp2 10s and 10's Mac's with the exception of three gigabytes of RAM in here versus four on here so you're really switching between apps and need a powerhouse on the phone the 10s is where you gotta go the 10 arc is basically for everyone else so with that 750 dollar price tag what are you missing out on and there's some things that I thought I'd really be missing because I didn't pick up a 10s or 10s max I did okay that's why they're here but in terms of my daily driver which I've put my SIM card into what phone do I want to use and where am i okay compromise it and that's where I was really shocked and why I made so many 10 R vs 10s Max and 10s videos in the drop test as you saw with the 10 are being made out of aluminum versus steel on the 10s you'd think they're cutting down on materials because they are and that means price can be a little less and you're basically gonna have a phone that'll break that's what I thought but what I actually found out in the drop test in hitting both with the flamethrower and scratching both is the 10 R is a beast literally it is a beast of a phone it is the most durable iPhone I have seen in a very long time and that definitely comes with a few sacrifices with the 10 R over the 10s you're not getting that OLED panel that beautiful screen with the inky blacks it's a beautiful panel honestly OLED panels are my favorite I'll say it now with the 10 art you're getting an LCD with kind of a thicker bezel and the way that works is the lights taper off towards the edges to kind of give that effect the difference with OLED and LCD is how it's powered so with the 10r it's just one light underneath all those pixels with OLED in the 10s its individual and why this is such a big deal is with the tower I thought battery life was just gonna suck you know you're compromising on price it's what you'd expect right the only reason I picked up the 10s Max and paid the twelve hundred and fifty dollar price tag for this one the 256 gig my personal one is battery life for me I am a power user I'm always on email always unsnap insta you guys know it's just text alert in case you didn't know it's a big deal to have a phone that can actually last you an entire day and still give you everything you want and that's what I thought the tennis max would be but I'm finding a little bit better usage than ten compared to the 10s it's a little bit better because yeah there's a bigger battery and that will change the 10r after using it for five days I have actually been able to finish the day out with around thirty percent battery so for me that's lasting an extra hour to longer than the iPhone 10's Max or iPhone 10s that's just what I've been seeing could just be me how I'm actually using the 10r it might be adjusting how I'm using my phone I mean it's not a six point five inch screen it's six point one inches so maybe I'm changing with this phone whatever it is I like it I like how much money I saved I like everything it's about do you guys know everything there is to know about the 10r there are a ton of YouTube videos on it and really it's up to you to pick out if you like the 10r or don't vote up in the iCard which is your favorite color because that's really the biggest sell the 10r is you're getting a little bit of color you're getting a little bit of a different experience we'll say you're getting a wider camera lens because there's only one on the back instead of two and yeah you're getting better battery life I was shocked honestly this video surprised me the whole idea of the ten are really surprised me from watching videos to taking photos to literally just insta story it feels okay one thing that looks weird though is the display I'm so used to the iPhone tennis max with those inky black sand just what : looks like and that's really the only drawback and yeah that's obvious you're getting kind of a ok screen compared to this amazing screen if you really think about it but okay is sometimes alright and what I've seen is when I've actually pulled up the viewfinder to like take a photo it looks a little grainy and then when I actually like post a photo and check that photo on like an OLED phone so 10 s max it looks really good and that's cuz it's the same 12 megapixel camera as all phones the difference is you don't have that telephoto option that you do on the tennis or tennis max oh you guys basically know what this is about the iPhone 10 R is a phone I totally recommend buying I think it's kind of a surprise that I wasn't expecting from Apple this year and that's super rare I've been doing this whole I phone thing for what eight years now I've been loving everything apples made throughout the years but honestly I just felt kind of bored with where things were going until the 10r showed up it seems that this could be with the iPhone 5c tried to do just now it can actually happen Tim Cook literally this wouldn't have happened if you weren't the supply chain man it wouldn't it wouldn't this would not actually happen so that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed coming a little bit different style you didn't drop a like on it and if you want get
