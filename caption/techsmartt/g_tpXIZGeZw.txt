hey guys tech smart for yet another IndieGoGo project this one really caught my eye and I think it has something that I really haven't seen before something that you guys can get its link down in the description but what this is is a short throw projector that basically turns any surface into a touchscreen and it goes up to a hundred inches don't know about you but that sweet you guys want to check it out I'll leave a link down below this popped my eye I checked out some IndieGoGo stuff okay the puppy cute with the name like puppy you're a little into old you're a little intrigued okay this was larger than I was expecting but if it's all in here that slot looks real interesting not too heavy I will check that uh that that could have been it but it wasn't built like a tank and it looks really cool so here is puppy I feel like we should give it a name at its it's only right you're naming it what do you name it Grover the puppy boom ad nailed it with that name so here's what's up with puppy it is a 10-point any touch kind of system which allows you to make any surface pretty much touchscreen so in vertical mode it'll go up to 23 inches and then in horizontal mode it'll go up to 100 inches you heard that right up back on an inch TV dreams are here make your dreams come true and that just sounded crazy when I even saw this heard about this and that's exactly why I'm making this video to put those claims to the test Oh says puppy it's only like around three three and a half pounds and honestly if you're into the whole office whoa if you're into the whole making your office next level and really trying to get a cooler desk or definitely have a cooler dusk than anyone else you work with anyone else in school whatever this is it we're gonna try this out on a few other surfaces I don't mind it it's really ain't like a touchscreen tablet that you get to make let me give you guys a quick spec breakdown of puppy it has 32 gigs of internal storage quad core processor four gigs of RAM basically an Android device so it has Android 6.0 EV check that out and what's really sweet is it is 36 millimeter dual stereo speakers and what's really cool about this is it as a USB 3 port HDMI headphone jack and then obviously where you charge it and then a camera right at the top so volume buttons power on your battery life from what I'm seeing around 140 ish minutes so just a little bit over two hours obviously you need to charge it in the future I'm hoping these things get smaller and last longer I mean you have all your Android apps from the Play Store well check out some Netflix watching Netflix on your table think about that for a second this thing runs Android okay it's pretty smart and you can basically turn any surface into the screen so if you wanna have like a Twitter feed up and really customize it towards a new wall you can do that now I love it 20:18 so here's a little bit of actually my personal netflix account I have one every week here at the tech smart HQ in LA and then one where this is just my all-time favorite shows that I've been watching this year the office Trailer Park Boys American vandal a little bit of Breaking Bad that 70 Show has quickly become one of my favorite shows just a all-time this year black mirror of course so let me know what you guys think about puppy in the comments but uh I'm kind of digging it so far so go home boom like that wait sir these are games so to make it vertical oh you just turn it speakers it's a little touch sensitive and you definitely have to get the hang of it but it's pretty loud I will be so honest a little annoying at least with just this noise but hey that's why we can mute it F so one three out of the five games okay one player round one hump I could see this actually becoming interactive with the right games I don't want to say fortnight on a table would be sweet but you kind of get where I'm going Punk push push push okay [Music] Jesus Christ that's Jason Bourne the one thing that I don't think we take into account is Wii games you're actually just rubbing your finger against a surface really fast and you know I would say I'm a pretty tough guy but yeah that kind of hurt after a little bit but other than that this is really fast and really awesome so I actually got a game called Peppa's Pig fired up here you immediately you can just jump into anything this is really an Android device with puppy it starts at $7.99 on IndieGoGo and from what I can tell so far it works and it works really well it actually knows when it's being picked up and I think that's just battery conservation it's really just a super-powered Android smartphone in a box with a high-powered camera this Bluetooth 4.0 it's miracast it's airplay compatible I really wish and I can't wait for the next gen cuz I'm guessing battery life will probably be double if not triple but I think what's really cool is you can actually turn anything into a touchscreen they say up to a hundred inches let's find out so this is what puppy looks like a hundred inch screen projected on a wall so obviously it's not touchscreen that any touch only works from 23 inches that's cool if you want to take it really big throw it on a wall what actually got going on is this plugged into laptop pretty easy just HDMI in on both sides really Chris I mean this is just a 720p HD video 60 frames per second but you can definitely tell the latency super low see here guys that is the puppy cube if you guys let me check it out links down below if you guys are new make sure to drop a like
