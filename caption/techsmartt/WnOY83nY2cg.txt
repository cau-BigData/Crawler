so the holiday season is quickly coming up and if you're like me in the family I'm the tech guy if you guys couldn't have already guessed I always have to get my family the latest and the greatest tech that's what they depend on me for I drop a comment down below letting me know which holiday you guys celebrate personally for me it is christmas happy holidays to everyone but what we're about to do in this video is by my sister mom and dad the greatest tech out there let's go so here's what we're gonna do to make this super simple we're gonna go on to three different websites Amazon Target and Walmart we're gonna be using this tool called - lame which is like a password manager shout out to them for actually sponsoring this video do you guys want 10% off the premium service I'll leave it link down below at the description I don't know what just rolled around and think there's someone on our feelings so here's how - Lang works basically it's a password manager that keeps all your logins credit card info pretty much everything secure and makes it super simple so when you just log on to a site like Amazon I'll do in a second here it auto fills in everything you need you don't even need to do any work and for me I don't know about you guys I sometimes use this same password for more than one site and that is a no-no that is not secure at all so with dashlane they have an easy password generator so if I wanted to just hit add new login type in the URL so we'll just say Best Buy for example my login put the email down and then password I just hit generate here comes up with a really random but really secure password and it's copy password so it'll save it to your clipboard hit OK and just like that we now have Best Buy all saved injures so that's how dash line works and they're premium service is pretty sweet too so if you guys want 10% off I'll leave a link down below in the description now let's get shopping so the first site that we're gonna be visiting is amazon.com everyone on my family wants stuff from Amazon always and I'll show you guys how dash line works I got an iOS and Android app -
