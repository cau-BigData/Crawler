hey what's good guys welcome back to tech smart for kind of a classic but a world first so you guys know the brand new iPhone 10s just came out and in front of me I got the brand new iPhone 10's max the best my favorite one in the gold color and it looks really good it's kind of crazy that there's this new screen time feature on here this is one of the new things that I just checked out I just got this phone a few hours ago but one of the new things that Apple talked about was this phone being ip68 certified so on the brand new iPhone 10s and 10's max it is ip68 certification which means up to one meters worth of water or depth for up to 30 minutes so basically your phone is now waterproof if you have an iPhone the last year 2017 iPhone 10 was also ip67 so that's not up to liters worth of depth but around 30 minutes worth of waterproofing so this year it's all official and I really want to put this to the test and see how waterproof this thing is and if it's secretly waterproof up to basically if you leave it at the bottom of the ocean so that's what we're gonna do it's gonna get crazy so in front of me kind of we're testing out something new this year which is a bucket with holes so I've just been taking scissors and adding holes to this bucket so what we're gonna do is put the iPhone 10s max and we're actually going to put a timer on here now we're gonna take this to the Sydney Harbour which has salt water it's the Pacific Ocean where actually in Sydney Australia right now and definitely check out the playlist up there in the iCard if you guys have missed any of the iPhone tennis content got it early for you guys and there's a secret giveaway or that's linked in the description so we're gonna take the 10s put it in this bucket and basically drop this bucket to the bottom of the Sydney Harbour or as long as our rope goes do you have about thirty meters of rope we're gonna double check that but we want to see if we submerge the brand new iPhone 10s max for over 30 minutes does it still work especially in salt water and is this thing basically a super proof phone so we're outside the Sydney Harbour I think we're on one of the piers right now pretty interesting scene it's a really beautiful day and I'm not gonna lie we just pulled up here with a black hashtag totes bag the minute we showed up everyone else left so let's just do this and if anyone asks Matt what are we saying it's nice right let me show you guys kind of a full contraption all set up here and by the way our clothing we're in just launched link in the description are just strange club only 100 pieces each all right let's just do this stop plug in so here we go one of these reusable tote bags we filled it up with rocks so cool pretty much sync the minute it hits water and then in my pocket we got the brand new iPhone 10s Mac so the gold color let's check out the photo want to take on here such a nice day little noisy we got a bunch of ships around us but luckily we're pretty much throwing this phone in the bucket and gonna let drop so cookie boat up in the iCard if you think the iPhone tennis Macs are really just the 10s are gonna be secretly waterproof now that they're both IP 68 certified they can be in water for up to 30 minutes we know that up to a meter but how deep is this mat do you want to jump in and find out and before we drop this film quick a boat up in the iCard I'm just making this realization who do you think is whiter the phone or my thigh I can't really tell we're gonna get this phone started I'm hit start on the stopwatch if you guys can see it's pretty much 113 or 114 right now here in Australia because keep that in mind while the stopwatch is going and it's in there we're gonna try to keep this going in for about an hour so I have it on low power mode too and we're just gonna throw it in here no games so this is a 30 meter rope so keep this in mind it's around 10 meters to the water so it's around 10 meters to the water and then an extra 20 meters that's how long we're gonna get of depth so this is gonna be a pretty interesting test because the iPhone says can last up to 1 meter or one and a half meters worth of water up to 30 minutes so we're gonna find out if it's still the ultimate comparison it just let you guys know the stopwatch still running - almost three minutes in there so let's drop the stick my science project I just taking on water Matt have your foot on the rope dude oh it's going deep it's going deep we are at the bottom well we're gonna just tie this up like a boat and just sit for a number this doesn't look sketchy at all now jump up the sandstone so it's been about three minutes should we try to call it [Music] because it'll be fun to see what they think about the new 10s Max and it's waterproof let's check out the phone whoa phone is off well this thing is soaked so the reason why this is such a big deal is the 10s max is not turning on it pretty much died it was around half battery life not super cold or anything but check out this thing just leads all the water out of it obviously that mean you can't take your new tennis max on vacation maybe just keep it to the hotel pool so this is one thing to note on the 10s Max's and kind of maybe the reason why this phone just completely died so I was trying to figure out where the water was actually draining from on this phone because it's got to come out somewhere right you would think it'd be the holes to charge for it at the bottom but no when I press down here and catch this the water actually comes out of the screen and typically on phones I haven't done anything this phone has not been dropped no cracks it's completely fresh 10 s max the other one we actually cracked and you guys saw that in the video if not it's right up there in the iCard but very interesting maybe the adhesive isn't that sticky or sticky enough to make these phones waterproof or ip68 resistant I don't really think the phone's gonna work we're gonna try to take it to a shop or take it to a rice bag see what brings this thing back to life but yeah so here's what the video gets kind of interesting the reason we're back inside at a makeshift studio that we literally made happen from Ikea so in classic techsmartt water test fashion things got really interesting right here is actually the phone that we had from the Sydney Harbour it's been sitting in rice and can hear a little bit of water inside my guess is the adhesive because of the pressure actually started to weaken and then water started to seep in and because it was saltwater that's honestly what destroyed the phone I don't know that for sure but maybe trying to turn it on nothing's happening so I'm gonna throw this back in rice I'll let you guys know on Twitter I'm just techsmartt if anything happens that phone could be completely toast but what I really want to find out is with a brand new iPhone 10's max got it in the gold color a second one here for this video if it's something that's Apple full or if it's just water pressure and that's what you get if you go past one and a half meters worth of depth so we're gonna find this out this is fresh water here that's the huge difference as well as obviously depth this isn't one and a half meters this is maybe few centimeters you guys are from New Zealand can you please help 12 twelve centimeters so I got a stopwatch all pulled up on the iPhone 10's max we're basically gonna drop it in see how long it lasts at 15 minutes hopefully it's still running I guess it will let's see so here we go in three two one [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here's the deal and kind of what we're realizing that the iPhone that we put in the Sydney Harbor the reason why it broke is the pressure so obviously with ip68 certification that means up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes the phone should be good to go and honestly since we did more than 1.5 meters I think we used around 20 that rope was crazy all I know is the pressure ended up loosening the adhesive that surrounds the display and from what I'm seeing now a few of the 10s max displays are actually faulty so that could be a problem that could have just been one where it wasn't applied right I don't know it's too close to really call it if the phones aren't the best displays on the maxes but here's what I can tell you about this one the phone is still running and surviving obviously didn't power off the phone works fully fun pretty much safe to say the pressure is what killed your first phone but that's kind of interesting with the whole display so let me know in the comments if you guys have heard anything about it or if you guys have a 10 s max and how your display is looking if you guys have started to see any problems definitely subscribe by clicking the button right down here TV lock for all beat 10s and 10's max content there's also a playlist link right down there if you guys want to check it out as well as two other videos that's gonna do it and this was a super interesting video I'll see you guys next time please [Music]
