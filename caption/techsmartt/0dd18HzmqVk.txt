all this year I've been looking for the cheapest tablets that you could possibly find on Amazon and Amazon sells their Kindle Fire and that's technically the cheapest tablet you can find and I actually checked one out earlier this year as a part of the five-minute speed shopping video on Amazon you guys missed that video I'll leave it link right up there in the iCard probably the best buy next to the video camera but right in front of me I got three different tablets that are the cheapest ones you can find aside from the Kindle Fire we're gonna see how good they are if they suck I'm interested I'd be for 42 dollars that's the cheapest tablet we have on this list let's see if it's any good so you guys want to check out any of these tablets I'll leave a link down below one goes for $42 the other one goes for 47 and then the last one goes for about 49 bucks so we'll check them out and kind of see how they compare to each other the first we're gonna be looking at is this called B you tab tablet comes in pink a lot of these tablets they kind of just look the same and have different branding but let's see we get in the Box pink got the color codes there see all right I mean it looks okay just off first glance how do you charge this thing up microUSB all right pretty standard stuff so here is the $42 tablet on first impressions it feels I want to say better than a Kindle Fire I don't know why I just I like something that isn't completely forked like this is Google Play on it you get a camera on the front a camera on the back speaker on the back two micro SD card slot volume up volume down and eat it doesn't feel super cheap and I like how it's in landscape just that is nice alright let's turn this on and see how good it is power buttons at the top headphone jack - I mean I like the port's at the top it's kind of nice doesn't get in the way if you're holding it I like I like the palm to your hands the screen doesn't look the best let's wait till it fully boots up that's enticing that sounds like there's hope rebellions a building all right so this is at full brightness and you guys can see it just from the overhead it's not that bright in real life it's barely visible interesting all right let's see what version Andrew this thing's running I'm guessing it's like Android 780 7.1 of course not of course Android 4.4.2 so it's running Android KitKat and normally don't go too technical on these specs here but when you're buying a 42 dollar tablet you gotta know it's good so let's watch a youtube video and see if that even works alright the video loaded up the screen definitely looks a little blue I just checked the specs it's a 1280 by 800 screen so it's barely 720p HD it looks like everything's going on at night Wow alright the screen is it's decent it's what you'd expect for 42 bucks let's see what's good in the benchmarks so I'm gonna run the antutu 3d benchmark here we're gonna do this on all the tablets and you see what kind of score it gives us in a benchmark just case you guys don't know and let me know in the comments which score you guys get for your device at home if you want to test out Geekbench or and - - like the one i'm about to run basically what a benchmark is it gives you a overall score for your tablet or your devices max performance so runs a test and you can run this on a few other tablets that's what we're about to do I kind of just see from a technical standpoint where things fall it literally did not run on the tablet and crash so that's what you can expect from this $42 tablet alright so videos are kind of decent it won't actually run a benchmark so let's just see how good the cameras are I think that's pretty much all we can do see how good the front-facing cameras jeez I look uglier than usual Wow I just look pale I blend in with the ceiling so good the back camera is like this has to be better yeah I mean you can tell it's an iPhone so $40 tablet interesting but let's see what else we got next if we got or $47 tablets so we're stepping it up a little bit five extra bucks let's see what improvements we're actually getting it's got the word pro on the box that's I'm optimistic I'm actually optimistic 7-inch tablet let's go with the new tab oh my really really really really it's the same design as the pink one literally the same design just with different branding and more money speaker on the back logo not in the center on the bottom cameras in the same spot this is the exact same tablet just more money and Brandon differently it's turning on the display looks better than the last tablet although it I think it's the same what to see what's good here quickly but up in the iCard which tablet you got oh that's nice which tablet you guys think is gonna be the most worth it it might be this forty seven dollar one yeah the display it looks better still really blue alright let's keep the camera first those are some noises I've never made before yeah I want to say you can see a little more color than the $42 one interesting let's try out the rear camera here it looks decent on the display you guys got to be the judge so I'm trying to get the n22 3d benchmark to load up here it's saying apps not installed but I just checked in it is installed so luckily we're gonna try out the n2 2 standard benchmark and see what store score we get it should be the same and I read it on the $42 one just quickly here and what we got was a score of 14,314 let me know in the comments again which score you guys get at home when I run it on this one here it's saying score a 14,000 423 kind of interesting cuz these are the same tablet this one's more I mean shouldn't we have the same score across the board yeah it looks like it's bugging out it's it's for sure bugging out Wow alright I look like I'm in the Blue Man Group I'm afraid I just blew myself this tablet did make me look like a smurf like I actually look like a smurf we're gonna step it up we're gonna check out the $49 one here I'm hoping it's better I don't look like a smurf and I'm actually hoping benchmarks run fusion 5 7 inch screen quad-core processor that might be good here that might be helpful to ram alright feel solid I mean this definitely feels like a Nexus 7 if you guys remember that camera on the back camera on the front SD card slot all these have SD card slots so you're chillin charge ports at the top mic USB port at the top headphone jack the display looks more promising and we're in the boot up phase right now this might be the best tablet on this list obviously it cost more money but the screen is bright things are visible I can see hi Android is this running BAM Android 5 ok I'm just jumping the gun every single time wanting one of these cheap tablets to run Android 7 dot oh not happening but let's see what the score is so 18,000 563 definitely better than the other two tablets specs look decent I mean this might be the tablet for you let's hope I don't look like a smurf when we watch a video yes yes yes yes yeah buddy cameras looking good cameras looking good let's take a selfie just a good looking selfie there you guys got to be the judge on this one I gotta see what the rear is like the rear camera that is take the same photo yeah yeah I think it's the best so here's my assessment out of three of the cheapest tablets you can find on Amazon not including the Amazon tablets not the Kindles basically the $49 one is the Best Buy here it's a pretty chill tablet don't expect too much from it I was actually surprised it could do what it did so that's gonna do for this video make sure you guys get subscribed with notifications turned on if you're new and let me know in the comments if you guys are just joining the notice gang makes you follow us on the instant story because that's where all the behind the scenes are always happening with the crew and I'll see you guys later peace
