Dario perfect I am very happy the best headphones I've ever heard fifty one dollars for refurbished Apple products so that's where they're going it makes sense what is this mini I don't think that's the phone charger I was looking for no way a computer we have so many more videos all right one more thing I'm just gonna buy it super quick there's so much good stuff on wish okay we're doing it we gotta do it now pick something Keaton we're going for it we're going for the oversized remote-control car awesome grandchildren will be happy if the grandchildren are happy I'm gonna be happy I'm getting Type three I'm getting it in red that's sold out okay getting in blue sold-out black 54 bucks feeling good all right let's pop to the car we got one two three four five six seven eight nine Em's in my bank account no I'm just kidding 21 7 all right so we got a lot of stuff 454 dollars worth of stuff 454 bucks see you in a month so it took about three weeks everything came we got one two three four five six seven eight we got nine products here that's awesome you know we got to jump in so the first thing we're gonna check out are the nine dollar Apple earpods fix I lost my real pair of ear pods this is pair 21 rest in peace forever you guys know I have a huge problem just check Twitter you'll see when I lose a pair maybe you'll find the pair for me so for nine bucks these things seem like a steal if they actually work get some other funky colors I saw that I wish I wanted to keep it authentic and get the white ones you got red is that rose gold okay a lot of colors I got here the i7s you have a battery phone calls music while that is a fat case what it was I a part of it on that one did I just break it I'm telling you this is why we have to do the wish videos guys does it just pull off or is it supposed to I couldn't tell you this is what all those Instagram ads are saying when you can get the air pods for free for five dollars for one dollar whatever it is this is the difference this is what they should look like this is what they actually look like I'm done talking I'm gonna try these out how do you turn these on if these both connect usually how this goes down is only one will work so it's kind of like a fake earpiece not for real air pods honestly at this point I should just get one of these tooth bristles it's only coming out of one here really Oh bananas that's crazy okay so only one will connect by default to get them both to connect you have to hold down the buttons on each of the air pods phi0 it out of both so we're gonna play bag bitey grizzly love the new album activated you guys know I'm a huge fan if you're following my Spotify playlist I'll leave it linked down below how does it sound there's no bass it's so tinny it's like an aluminum can can't wait til I've got me a bag can't wait to that guy me I back honestly for nine bucks not the worst deal ever you don't feel bad about losing these like I do it hurts saying that so you guys know overall I spent almost 500 bucks the next thing is a little more expensive it's 22 bucks and it's the magnetic floating globe I don't know why I buy this crap what if it doesn't work that's so rad okay so my guess is you plug this in you just throw the ball in between these two beams and it just floats let's see hmm whoa whatever you check in that that's insured it like it's magnetic guys if you thought it was a magnetic trust your boy flava flav in the I mean I think this is just gonna work what how does anyone have any ideas on how this one's gonna work so well Kyle's telling me is you need this foam spacer to block the magnet so it thinks it's I'm just gonna shut up and show you okay so here's the deal there is no spinning globe no no we made it happen guys so for 14 bucks the 16 times optical monocular telescope showed up it showed me that you can find birds that's what most birds look like but with this thing that's what birds actually look like let's open this up oh wow this seems much heavier than I was thinking just a phone mount right like did they just throw a freebie in because they were feeling bad wait it's all making sense now this is not a telescope this is a telescope for your phone that's why there's this phone clip that's why there's this thing it goes here so it screws on like this and then your phone attaches like this oh wow this is a break there all right I'm gonna outside we're gonna see if it actually makes a difference and if you can see Birds so it looks like this might not be the most practical thing it's more of like a spy cam remember this thing's huge and people are gonna see that you're spying on them so Birds maybe more like a stalker cam so this is item for the fake beats by dre the wired ones so do you should be beats threes I paid like 51 bucks for it and drop a comment with your favorite item in this video the one that you thought was the most worth it let's see if it's this we were these faker refurbished they're selling some refurbished stuff so these were once real and now they're I wish wow okay I wasn't even gonna say these feel fake these feel real so at the beach 3s in case you guys haven't seen these desert definitely a steel 51 bucks I'm gonna recommend these like adjustable headband you have a nice metal frame leather ear cups in for the most part it's it's pretty comfy throw them on the head and see how they sound oh yeah dude these are just beech trees these are real the leather feels real oh here we go so listen to rise by Jack and Jack you guys know them and Jonas blue Wow bass is there I'm not gonna say bass is there cuz it's beats but for 51 bucks these are refurbs these sounds really good that might be the favorite and we got one of course I'm wish I'm gonna always scoop some iPhone cases I'm gonna find some good ones one day the Batman one was three bucks this hard shot one was nine see the difference the bad that one looks a little bit more rugged wait a minute this switched iphone case it was supposed to be red let's try this out for nine bucks if these tips were red I would have the Nintendo switch iPhone case I've never seen a piece like this before it's got all the cutouts for all the sensors I'm gonna put this on the top oh whoa that's funky F dude imagine this with red bumpers it would have been the Nintendo switch iPhone case if you drop your phone I'm just telling you now it's not gonna be safe these bumpers are flying strapped the $3.00 Batman one it's a one-piece with the stand on it okay actually 'he's gonna give you protection and i don't want to use they oak eaten it cracked your phone no the phone was cracked before the video in the stand just watch youtube in the morning just chill three bucks way better pickup than this this is the most expensive purchase in the entire video the refurbished HP laptop hundred twenty seven bucks i've never bought a computer before on a site like wish which is a great app ever not pay me to say that but like if this laptop turns on we just bought a laptop refurbished it's a power it's bad boy on you got three USB I'm gonna say 2.0 ports I don't think the 3.0 there's no way they could keep it under a hundred and thirty bucks and give us 3.0 HDMI which is nice full-size headphone jack SD card reader that's on this side oh no that's where you charge it I don't even think this thing can run a screen recorder maybe I'm just gonna show you guys what I see that doesn't sound like cortana i'ma trust you PC ready for all you plan to do you can use your voice or the keyboard along the way and if you'd like me to stay quiet no I don't need you to tell me I'll just figure it out myself we're going as fast as we can I don't know manly I don't see that on any other laptops telling ya we're going as fast as we can like you just do it so I'm still trying to set the laptop but let's check this out it is the hundred and eight dollar killer laser I didn't think this is real I didn't I don't think this is legal oh my no way what is this dude how fatter these batteries four thousand milliamp hours I'm not responsible if you buy this one links in the description as always dude this is military-grade Wow and it comes with a pair of fancy sunglasses got a dig that and wait are you joking me what are these a plastic knobs for these just change up the the beam shape I hope that there was some science worth for that but like we have keys for our laser pointer any last words before I turn the switch and we all die like our eyes are gonna melt whoa whoa okay I'm okay that blue light is scary it's gonna burn the box all right don't look don't look just trust your boy I feel like my eyes are melting now I can't look I'm just gonna hold it did it burn the bot okay turn it off turn it off before you let it go all right lasers off let's see if it did anything nothing so I don't think it worked in the last one is the beam was super wide so now that it's a little more narrow got some balloons leftover from my 21st birthday turn the key eyes closed let's see if it pop some balloons I'm gonna jump if it does gate do you think we got bamboozled I don't want to look at the balloon because I'm just gonna freak out I don't like loud noises and I blink a lot I don't think it burns anything so I'm sitting here for okay I'm sorry I really like to sorry about that guys I actually hit the button I've been trying to pop this balloon for a while I've been letting it sit it's not like the ones you see on YouTube by the cool youtubers that are like popping everything it's one of those I guess wish products you wished for this is the $55 RC full remote car full wheel full remote 54 bucks I'm starting come back I'm watching like David Oh Birds vlog he got Jonah one of these and Jonah was so happy whoa all right it's on feels pretty sturdy 50 bucks it's like why do why do you think it's not gonna go that way Keaney Oh daddy's got some jets and batteries were all in it the only thing left to do is go outside race some cars this car is way better than I was expecting a lot of stuff and where she'd never know 55 bucks this thing feels like it's got more horsepower than my Honda Civic it turns really well do this thing I wish I got this in the first episode I would be loved in life even more so refurbished HP laptop we finally got it working it weighs about it's a pound and a half to two pounds nice size about a 13-inch screen so it's not the worst bang for the buck if we can open up anything worth the hundred and thirty bucks sure please take me to Google
