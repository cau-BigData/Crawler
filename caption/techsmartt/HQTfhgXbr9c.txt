with you guys keeping here so basically if you're not following the series this is a really exciting video I have this massive large brown box in front of me and there's another one too this came all a part of one video so this was the getting free wish tech items if you guys missed it I'll leave a link right up there in the iCard go check that out okay so this item just popped up it's a little pricey it's a $500 gas-powered scooter I don't know if I want to pick this up just because of how much it is so why this is so awesome is on the wish app I found this product that was like a five hundred hour $500 $500 gas-powered scooter I didn't think it was really real $500 on an app like wish you know you don't really know what you're buying so I went for it you guys hit the twenty thousand likes so make sure you guys keep it locked for the next episode get subscribed if you guys liked it it's here so I'm gonna put this thing together hopefully it goes alright come along I'll answer some questions hang out hopefully we get this going cuz it looks like a lot of fun okay so let's just tackle this beast so the first thing I think it's also known as the skater X online it's a 44 C two-stroke engine if you guys are into that kind of thing it should have some power I don't know how this is gonna stack up against my boosted board become fun to try that gas-powered skateboard kinda the opposite we have Electric skateboards now but we'll take it sure you guys Wow oh right we definitely got it we got it so we have our skate deck I don't know if this is bamboo it doesn't look like bamboo looks like a cheaper wood I mean this is only 500 bucks a nice loaded DAC man 2 well over 100 so Wow all right this is the grip tape it says skater X as you guys can see looks like decent grip tape hopefully it'll keep me on the board it's always the goal all right now let's open up this big box I don't want him to eat those peanuts coming in here they're annoying to vacuum I got the peanuts on me did not have a feeling last but not least we have the motor this just feels so crazy drop a like if you guys are from the whish video and you guys got subscribed this is because of you guys so Wow dude those just white pellets they annoy me I don't like styrofoam I really don't like the noise of it also drop a like if you hate the noise of styrofoam or nails on a chalkboard hate that Wow so here is the plan we're gonna get the deck started first we've got some nuts and bolts in the box well that's a problem mini unbearable hours late oh cool so I'm back it's been about a week and we got all the screws needed hopefully to assemble the gas-powered skateboard so before we go ahead and put the scooter together big thanks to Viggo video for actually sponsoring this video so if you guys are know about Viggo basically check it out link down below it's an original short-form vine style video app so basically what that means is you can create these 15 second or less videos share them around there tons of fun you can add music get as stickers it's a good-looking app so what's cool about it is you can actually earn flames by the more original consistent and frequent you post on the app and what's even cooler is right now they're having a 15 seconds to flame challenge where basically 10 lucky winners are gonna win a hundred thousand on the app it equals around fifteen hundred bucks so go check it out make sure with the content that you make you use the 15 seconds to flame stickers link down below let's open up the scooter I hope this turns out good functional the board is actually cracked so maybe we're gonna stay alive on this one I'm not too confident right now I am doing the front axle with the crack that my hope is these screws are strong enough to hold half deck that is coming up onto the board these light goals they're gonna kill me seriously or this board is gonna kill me so I will be dying from this video it's guaranteed this thing better be cool that's all I'm saying I'm willing to put the time in it just better work and it better be cool I even got the right feel for it cuz it doesn't even take gas my car is powered by the wind what is this design I even got a Space Gray uh hammer here I'm gonna be upset if that's the front I'm gonna be really upset nah-nah have skateboards are designed there's no way in hell that fits I put it on the wrong way that's even scarier because this sides cracked that's going on the back I would have wanted a sturdier side where the motor is so I can at least just put my back foot there no it's too much to ask for there's no way I can let my friends ride this there's 100% no chance I will lose them as friends lose them as people their families will lose them and these are people we will be really miss look at this can you see through it it's a mess I actually survived a ride on this guy oh you can hear that it does not sound good at keno me buddy you're almost done with the death machine 9000 you guys don't have to ride this all you have to do is just like the video it's not hard it's like it's not fair alright I'm scared for my life we can put bars on them to increase stability I don't really care to be honest no maybe that's how they hold together that sure yeah that's that's about as good as it's gonna get I don't know what these bolts are for I'm not gonna lie so basically I'm gonna fill this up with the 50 to 1 gas that we got we're gonna go outside we're gonna gas this thing up try it out hopefully we can ride it on the street and not die I'm not you know what I called my insurance agent we're good so hopefully this works what could go wrong three hours later we're outside now about the power that's up I'm not feeling good check this out look at this I'm gonna try to sit on it [Applause] unfortunately we could not get the board to work who did get some noises out of it I think I even saw some smoke but for some reason the gasoline is not flowing I've tried everything you tipped it upside down tried siphoning it just isn't working so that's it for the 500-hour gas-powered wish scooter if you guys liked this episode make sure to drop a like subscribe if
