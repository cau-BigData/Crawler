did it even come out what welcome back to another episode of rear chopping this time we are at $0.99 only store also known as the dollar store you guys voted on it make sure you vote up in the iCard which shall we check out next since most items are priced at $0.99 or less we'll see about that the very first thing that we found surprise is not $0.99 or under or only this isn't the $0.99 understood this is the $0.99 only store its build your own robot it's for five bucks sounds interesting robot alright I think I need a soda can so we gotta grab one of those but five bucks damn we started a hot the next thing that I found it's kind of something interesting it's from Despicable Me 3 I know the movie that's been in a few of these episodes before with the fluffy drone this is a fart gun I think it's just like an air gun I gotta know more about this the retargeted components sure this kid looks like he's having a lot of fun I'm gonna be that kid nowadays everyone wants to be a vlogger on YouTube get a tripod for 2 bucks still breaking the rules it's got a phone mount part looks interesting you can bend those and it articulates let me go so I don't know if you guys know this but I've actually been really digging my Apple watch as a blade I found another band it's always good to have an extra band this one goes for 3 bucks still break-in the cars here 99 only look what is going on here it said everything in the store mostly is $0.99 3 bucks but it looks good dude Kobe with the shots boy I was just thinking to myself already got a black Apple watch I want to get the white one white one same price $2.99 let me know in the comments if you guys own an Apple watch or have ever been to a 99 only store before I feel like I'm the only person here we didn't like my age group everyone else here is like way older than me so got an Apple watch band it's white I think the reason it's 3 bucks is cuz there's a stain I'm gonna see if I can fix that this thing kind of caught my eye here for 2 bucks it's an LED lamp usb-con lamp that makes sense looks interesting there's so many lights here it's got me twisting my words but for 2 bucks like I'm okay paying on that that makes sense and another thing I just found right next to it is this disco ball speaker never seen anything like this before for 6 bucks it's got bluetooth it lights up obviously because that's disco ball tell me something I don't know it sound interesting these are kind of worth it now going all these stores it really puts a lot of stress on my muscles during liftoff a USB vibrating massager pretty good sir 2 bucks he wants it I want it I'm not getting pink though we're gonna get the blue one there's even a yellow one that's cool no more manly when you're at the 99-cent only store you can't pass up a deal like this dollar for aged streamers I'm grabbing the 2-pack all right grabbing a few extras it's like the best thing ever here who wouldn't get this now there's one thing that I keep noticing in every store we go to they always have cheese nips I used to never see cheese nips in any stores I've always have to like really go out and hunt for him so I think $0.99 only store has watched the target episode if you haven't checked it out make sure you check it out right after this video ends they cheese knits there but I'm going to the dark side I'm going cheez-its today why do they keep showing up they always they're watching the people that own these stores they're watching let's give it up with that robot thing that I checked out need a soda can to design it at least that's what it's saying on the box so I'm picking up this Campbell's tomato juice in a can I've never seen this ever in my life and then just the classic v8 kiwi-strawberry robots gonna look lit we're gonna name it Campbell we're gonna go pay for this head back to the studio and check them all out I spent around $31 $34 with tax at the 99-cent only store that's actually not too bad considering we didn't just get five items we got seven I mean that makes sense because there's a lot of savings at the dollar store so the first thing that we're checking out is the thing that I'm most excited for it's a new Apple watch band I've got the official Apple watch band here it feels pretty nice I've dabbled around with a few cheap ones before or why I said I dabble around I just dab hit that dab so this was three bucks kind of everything at the 99-cent only store isn't 99 cents let me know in the comments how you guys feel about it do you think it's gonna be good or not and if you own an Apple watch well I'm realizing why this was so cheap now this isn't an Apple watch band of any sorts it's pretty much just a digital watch that looks exactly like an Apple watch I got fooled I was given the dollar store a little more credit but they don't actually deserve all that credit i link everything down below in the description but just go to your local dollar store or $0.99 only store and you'll find this it's not a bad looking watch not a bad looking watch it all kind of looks like my Apple watch a little bit I like it and just reading the packaging here it says digital watch I should have picked up on that a little earlier I was still really confident that this was just like an Apple watch case next up is this disco ball speaker I'm really excited because we're about to throw up party up and here that actually worked out a lot better than I was thinking this is a disco party ball speaker it's pretty much just a regular speaker with a disco ball on top it's six bucks though that's what I want you guys to pay attention to we're gonna see if this is actually worth six bucks Bluetooth connectivity two rechargeable alright the speaker feels pretty good it's not too heavy actually doesn't feel like it's worth six dollars which is really surprising in these cheap speakers so I'm gonna test this out recharge with micro USB I'm always that we're just gonna play panic at the Disco's death of a bachelor don't get that disco mood not too bad it sounds like the bass is like trying to make an appearance but it just can at least it lights up like it's a $6 disco speakers I'm not that surprised now this was something that caught my eye I thought it was like build your own robot with some sort of like gadgets in there like a motor you know a little little more stuff that'll robot that is a robot you designed for that I realized that as soon as I picked it up but it was five bucks so it's pretty much you can design your own robot build your own robot damn this I thought this was gonna be a lot cooler than it actually was oh this is kind of lame I'm not gonna lie this is I find some pretty lame stuff but this is definitely one of the most lame products I've ever checked out so you pretty much just grab any kind of soda can I got some tomato juice not your not your average tomato juice though made by Campbell's never seen that before and I don't even need to drink it but you know what we're gonna try what tomato juice in a can is like I'm not gonna lie that has a little bit of carbonation on it I think they're imagining people are gonna just pound these at lunch and stuff interesting really interesting all right I don't even want to chance it it's gonna tip over so we got the VA kiwi-strawberry so now we can just design our own robot we have a lot of pieces here alright give me a second 20 minutes lay down this is probably the dumbest thing I've ever checked out why did I pick this up I finished building the robot I found out it's actually battery-powered and this is what it looks like we got some plastic harness put around my v8 can there were so many pieces which is kind of interesting but here we go let's turn on the robot and somehow it's able to manage all the weight it looks like it's gonna topple over alright that's pretty cool we're five dollars I know this product really caught my eye because it's another Despicable Me 3 toy it's like they keep following me around let me know in the comments if you know which other weird shopping episode I checked out another Despicable Me 3 toy in only the superfans are gonna know this is a fart gun which I think it just pretty much blows air I hope that's what it does or else pretty sure that'd be illegal so let's open this up okay we get these cardboard cutouts for the movie so the directions on the back say just prop up these cardboard cutouts you bend them in place they stand up on their own then you just pull back and the air cannon will not come down all right this gun is kind of interesting it feels pretty rock-solid like I see where all the value is and and then you get this pullback lever just like a bag attached to it and that's where all the wind or farts in this case are generated from see if we can knock it over I think it only knocked it down because I was swaying I'm gonna shoot it at myself and see if I can feel anything stop it that's a little bit of wind I know you guys can't feel that but like where is where's the air we're Safari all right all right I got it I got it it's very subtle but it's enough to knock down some cardboard I was thinking it could try to knock over this Fiji bottle yeah no there's no way wow this uh I don't know I thought the other Despicable Me 3 tour is better moving on we got a tripod that works with any phone these things are interesting because for 2 bucks you have a way to like actually get stable video I know optical image stabilization it exists in the phones but if you want to maybe become a vlogger you now can thanks to the 99 cent old stores these tripods flexible yo this is actually something I'd recommend picking up let me know in the comments if you think this thing's worth it 2 bucks it's like a mini Jovi pod could really get a vlog going here and what's cool about it is now you have a tripod mount so if you want to do some instant photography BAM you just click your phone in there slides on in and what's cool is this is a tripod mount so you can get vertical horizontal video you're covered just kidding you can do that too but there's also an articulating ball head this is nice while this is really nice let's pull out my iphone we're gonna grab some quick video I think $2 is the cutoff point it barely fits my 7 plus but alright we gotta go in here the prop it up let's record some video I wanted to vlog with it yo what's up how does it look let me tighten it yo hey I'm vlogging all right it's it's swinging a little bit might be a little hard to vlog but not bad just when you thought it would get cheaper shocker it's not I got a dollar 99 USB LED lamp that knife is gonna drive me crazy this thing was sweet we have I think that's 10 LEDs one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 that is 10 LEDs wow this this just sounds way too good to be true I mean it is way too good to be true it's not even $0.99 connecting it to the usb see MacBook that that is articulating to what oh yo this is the greatest buy from 99 cents and only let me know in the comments which buy is the greatest this is really bright it's flexible that's a funky angle I'm gonna turn off all the lights and see how bright this thing actually is let's do it hope you guys aren't too scared I'm still here I just have all the lights turned off now I want to see how bright this thing actually is whoa no lie that is the greatest product I have found if we're shopping wow look at how bright this thing is on my face it's like I'm going into like a hospital or something this for any laptop you could be a book you would get work done on a plane wow this is the greatest thing ever bonus item I didn't say it for the light but this right here is the second bonus item and worried for a real treat two dollars no surprise nothing on this list was 99 cents but it is a vibrating massager sensors USB cable included so that's sweet anything without batteries would be good this is all I got in the box by the way there was no top no cable and actually it's battery-powered so yeah that kind of contradicts everything I would have loved the USB cable but I guess batteries is the way we're going it's like there was and there was a USB cable that wanted to be in the box but it's not so this is just a mini vibrating massager you just push down and it will give you a nice vibration nice massage that's that's alright kind of intense actually ooh I like that I like that a lot that is like deep tissue that's pretty nice Wow this bonus item the light if only it was it if it only if it only came with a USB cable that would be amazing the battery life unfortunately I'm not with it now it's time for me to tell you which was the most worth it there were some you know faulty ones in this episode but the one that is the most worth it by far has got to be this USB LED light so crazy let me know in the comments which item was your favorite on this list shoutout time
