so you guys know Tesla by now they're the most successful electric car company in the world in Elon Musk he always a chef and up something interesting whether that's SpaceX new Tesla cars or any of his other projects like the boring company and just a side note shout out to you on if you somehow are watching this video please send me a free Roadster 20/20 would really appreciate it but seriously you're one of my personal heroes thank you so much for everything you've done if you somehow watch this video make sure you get subscribed boss basically they're entering into this new category and it's iPhone accessories they dropped an iPhone case earlier this year now they came out with a charged bank never thought I'd be picking one of these up this retails for forty five bucks I'll leave a link down below when it comes back in stock side note I had to spend a hundred and sixty bucks just to get one of these power banks so you know the dedication is really real and honestly like Tesla products are kind of interesting I mean the cars are pretty cool but like the iPhone case is super cool this Powerbank looks great let's go ahead and check it out so really solid box kinda reminds you of like an Apple accessory forty five bucks for a Power Bait you could go on Amazon I'll leave a link down below to one of my favorites right now get like a twenty thousand milliamp hour battery pack will charge your iPhone 10 up to ten times for like twenty bucks so if you want this you got it Wow this I see why it was $45 I actually I don't see why it was $45 this just feels really nice so what this resembles and if any of you guys are Tesla owners drop a like on this video I really want to pick up one of the new roadster 2020s but this is supposed to resemble a supercharger which it does it looks good this gets an A+ in terms of design it yes it is forty five bucks so how this works is it's a power but it's not anything too technologically different but what's cool about it so you tap the bottom you can see if your power bank is fully charged up so a green light means you have 100% battery and the capacity on this battery bank is thirty-three hundred and fifty mili amp hours so just to put that in perspective that will charge your iPhone 10 up around one and a half times and on that's pretty bound so here's why I like this so much and here's why you might want to pick this up all the cables are integrated seem sleep into the design oh my god I didn't even know I didn't even think what Ilan what's good bro what's good okay so basically in this Powerbank you have the two cables you're probably gonna need the most it'd be sweet if they had a USBC model that is the future like let's be real here so in this Powerbank you get a mic USB cable that's just integrated into the side so you can just click that on up and on the left side you have your lightning cable so that's all pretty great now how you actually charge this up is from the bottom cable you're ready for it Yvonne's added everything Duke like it looks like I don't know what I'm doing here those USB ports so you just plug this into you like a wall brick for example this side you charge the battery pack up it looks pretty good it's nice what's interesting isn't the reason like I actually pick one of these up is my buddy Jerry rig everything Zac actually tore one of these down and inside is an 18 650 battery and what's cool about those and how this kind of ties in is those the batteries used in the new model 3 so you're kind of owning a piece of a model 3 in a power bank and that's kind of cool so I'll leave a link down below to his video if you guys want to check that out super interesting but I guess the only thing left for us to do is see if the power bank I spent a hundred and sixty dollars on is worth it and if the charges what's that no way I didn't think it would actually work just it's straight up it's straight up charges looks pretty good too so the reason I say you guys want me picked up like this is it's really slim that's about a charge and a half if you have an iPhone 10 just throw this in your pocket super easy super easy and it just kind of slides in doesn't look too weird in your pocket but Elon Musk getting into the iPhone accessory game jig is that's pretty true for this video definitely know what you think in the comments below if you guys actually own a Tesla make sure you guys can subscribe and you turn notifications on if you're new and let me know in the comments if you guys are just joining the notice squad make sure you follow us on the into story that's where you saw this and I might be getting your roadster help you over there I'll see you guys later peace
