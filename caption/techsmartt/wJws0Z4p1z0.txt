hey with you guys and welcome back to tech smart and what's in front of me is kind of something interesting ev this is Tesla and they're back at it again so I don't know if you guys have known but Tesla and I made a video on this thread up there in the icord or link down below I chord I card maybe the chords and the cards you should just check it out but Tesla made a battery bank last year and was really interesting only cost forty five bucks and had like a 3300 milliamp hour battery in it so that was cool sold out really quick but what's in front of me is their new wireless charger and this goes for 65 bucks has six thousand milliamp hours in it and jerry-rigged everything actually check this thing out first so I leave his video right up there in the iCard or link down below and he tore this thing apart and got shocked so I hope I don't get shocked but it's weird it's interesting these things sold out you don't even want to know AB you don't even want to know how much I paid for this are you ready vote up in the iCard real quick how much you think I paid for this battery bank and comment down below if you think you got it right I'll pin a funny comment that has the right answer in it so that's a little challenge for you here is the Tesla wireless charger it comes in two colors so you can get it in this black color it's got the Tesla logo right there looks pretty nice just the font looks dope to test the battery bank what can you expect it's gonna look like a Tesla product so here are the instructions shows you the LEDs how to charge so this is a six thousand milliamp hour battery in it and actually has a cable that wraps around the side kind of like the last one you guys don't know what I'm talking about seriously check out the old Tesla video I did and it's really nice because on the original one all they had was microUSB and lightning now we have USB C and I'm into that I know you're into that and it charges with this USB cable one thing that's kind of cool on Tesla accessories is the attention to detail and the design and EV and just check us out guys there's that LED light strip and I'm not acting like this is the coolest thing in the world because what's interesting is when you press it you can see how much juice it has charged it up kind of slow compared to other battery banks that I have so I don't know if it as fast charging on the way in and I kind of thought about this can you wirelessly charge your wireless charger I mean some battery banks can this thing's convene it you can put it in your pocket it'd be cool if you could so a light will come on if it's charging and I try to Center it up this would be the same if it is because if the wireless charger Wireless of charges that's pretty cool right on the back so the only way you can charge this is with the USBC cable or the cable included and that's why I really like some of the battery banks that include that integrated cable because alongside this what you can see is like there's two cables in here and there's two like outputs so you basically have your USB ports and your USB C ports built into the kind of design and I like that you don't get to see the whole port it doesn't look clunky it's all really designed well so let's try to fire this thing up and see if it wirelessly charge is my iPhone 10 so to hold this down you have to hold down the and it turns purple and boom did it just stop that quick you just saw that it started a charge now it stops almost like it doesn't hold the charge unless it knows the device is close to it which would make sense but it like turns off it stops detecting any devices near it after like five to ten seconds so I'm gonna hold them down again it's weird and now it charges up so one thing I see is like this rubber strip here and this is to protect the plastic I don't know why you want to protect the plastic because it's getting fingerprints and smudges like crazy but it keeps your phone elevated off of the actual power bank and that's kind of cool especially with phones having massive camera bumps so that's kind of nice and Tesla's end but this integrated cable it's it's pretty sweet so just by having it flush in the design you always have a cable near you so it's dope is a polka phone app one I've been using this thing like crazy just plug it in cuz now USBC because I always have to hit the button that's weird Tesla that's really strange I wish it just would go ahead and pick it up knows the device is plugged in do I have to hold it down - it's not even a button press and now that's just so weird okay now it's charging because I hit the button you can kind of see I can see it a little bit it's like that purple LED right here I wish it was brighter like did you even see it probably not it's it's kind of like a bad design F agrees I agree phone's charging which suite is on the other side since this is a USBC cable has to go around and be flush you also have your USB C port so just plug it like an iPhone cable here and charge this thing up the the old way out back in my day phones used to charge when you would plug them into your battery bank wait seriously do I always have to hold this down this is pretty dumb pretty dope not gonna lie for what I paid for this f you ready for it you ready for how much I paid I paid $400 to get this thing [Music] not 65 because I really wanted to check this thing out it look cool we test this an electric car company so maybe wireless charging leads to maybe wireless charging Tesla's that'd be cool the coil in here from what I saw pretty small so you need a pretty big coil to charge a car but if we can't even get our phones to charge there's there's a problem there Tesla is it not charge off this port either whoa that's just so weird maybe it doesn't wait really alright I'm gonna plug I'm gonna plug that port and now I'm gonna try and plug this one maybe you can't have two things charging at once we're finding this thing out for ourselves weird I'm just learning this I thought you could this USB C port on the side actually won't allow you to charge a device you see you guys know I'm not crazy you've charged my macbook let's see we can charge the polka phone from this should work wait are you serious it's kind of difficult to use $400 later I got to find that out right let me know in the comments what you guys feel about this right now I thought it would be charging from the USBC port no instead the USBC port is what charges the wireless charger it's not actually a port you can charge a device or anything off of that's really strange when I plug it into the polka phone f1 year it's actually using the battery from the polka phone f1 guess this is kind of smart right it's not that groundbreaking to charge the tesla power bank so I wish it actually had a USB C port that'd be so fire similar to like the Mophie power bank I'll leave my favorite link down below it's expensive it's over a hundred bucks it's reliable I know there's way better options out there I'm gonna link a few other ones down there that are cheaper too I'm actually kind of upset right now the first Tesla power bank was cool this does only lets you use the USB port USB a the old tech really strange Tesla really strange I don't know the wireless charger could charge off a wireless charger that'd be cool I'd forgive it all but I'm only getting an old port in one part what not everything Wireless charges that sucks so do you think it would charge off an iPhone is that just not happening yes definitely on and there's no charge really that's not smart this tech it's not smart ooh yeah I would say don't buy this it's like this sucks so there guys have it kind of an interesting discovery about the new Tesla wireless charger I thought it would have two working ports but it turns out the port of the future is only the port of charging on the wireless charger made by Tesla and electric company man it's just getting too crazy so that's it for this video if you guys like to make sure to drop a like and make sure you guys subscribe by clicking this button right down here if you guys are new check out two other videos over here and that og tell someone and I'll see you guys next time peace
