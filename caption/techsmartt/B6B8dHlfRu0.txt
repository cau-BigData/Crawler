the zenfone 5 this is my first impressions of it the first thing that I'm diggin is look at this screen to body ratio tiny notch right there it's looking solid and from this beautiful castle like I'm gonna take a bunch of photos check out this new camera are you guys pumped or what do you think great what's your favorite initial feature right now this Queen screaming we're out here in the daytime so it's a little hard to see I'll check it out inside but this castle is amazing they used to keep prisoners here I know that's not amazing but it looks beautiful so I'm on the top of Castel mundu Week yes pronunciation right this is taking me like five times it's beautiful up here some of this view she had the ships down there like a harbor pores that cruise ship oh that is a cruise ship so I'm with the zenfone 5 light and what's cool about this compared to some of the other phones is this is a dual camera on the front so two front facing cameras and what's sweet about this phone in particular is incan control broke with these front-facing cameras so I'm gonna quickly take a selfie show you what I mean I got some new for you to check out the new a Zen phone five eight take it take some pictures [Music] [Applause] submit lunch you're with squad right now say what's good squad all right there we go and I'm just checking out the zenfone 5 this is something kind of cool so there is AI built into the camera no no this meal looks pretty good now when I point the camera to it it detects that I'm taking a picture of food you see that fork and spoon I was gonna call it I see a fork and spoon show up right there so I can take the photo it'll adjust the settings because the knows I'm trying to take a photo of food so you can really get that good Instagram food shot or whatever you're going for in the minute I take it away no spoon no fork kind of cool this is the squatter what's left a day one squad is in front of sagrada familia by gaudi dog you must have spent a little bit more time than like a day on this thing this thing's beautiful dad I'm getting the full Barcelona tour right now and it's it's awesome does it stay to here in Barcelona I just can play with the zenfone 5 light all day I just got to the asus zenfone 5 event this is where you guys are gonna see it unveiled officially I've had it a little bit early semester out that it's been an awesome day I know it's like a late starts like 8 p.m. right now but let's head on into the event [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you even for chemists yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is the back to live event it just ended I'm outside of it right now ok Go's still playing you guys can probably hear him my favorite phone from the event they dropped three they dropped the zenfone 5 light the zenfone 5 and then the zenfone 5 said the said one just has the upgraded specs but the zenfone 5 is dope just look at this screen Martine was talking about it the screen of body ratio on here is gorgeous and the knotch is so small the coolest feature on here at least for me is gotta be the AI I've never really used artificial intelligence on too many phones before at least cognitively knowing hey like yo I'm using artificial intelligence which dope though is one of the features on here is called battery AI so basically when you charge your phone at night and you're sleeping throughout the night it's not good for your phone's battery to be charging throughout the entire night so using AI it knows when you wake up so it'll just supercharge it to like 80% in the first two hours then as you're sleeping just keeps it flat not charging it all very little and then right before you're about to wake up it'll get the phone to a hundred percent it's pretty cool it's a feature that's gonna come in handy for me and honestly with back to five here I'm a pretty big fan of the design the phone's not too thin but it's thick enough with some chamfered edges so it's not gonna be slipping onto your head glass backs nice fingerprint reader is lightning fast and faster than I thought it would be and there's even face unlock so all that in the zenfone 5 back to five baby great event dude okay goose crushing it right now so if you're a big fan of the zenfone 5 but you want something a little bit different you want something that has a better camera for example it's gonna be the light and honestly like I don't even think the light was gonna be this good you have two front-facing cameras on there 20 of megapixel front facing cameras I thought the photos I took look good not just cuz I'm the only one in them the back cameras dope you have a fingerprint reader on the back everything is so solid on both these phones Barcelona thank you so much and you've crushed it jiggers that's it for the zenfone 5 unveiling at the back to five event thank you guys so much for watching this make sure you follow me on the insta story so you guys aren't
