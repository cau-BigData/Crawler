got nine things in here 218 bucks let's shop a little bit more and of course you know I've got some family coming over for Thanksgiving I want to get some good wish Tech so I'm gonna get a bubble maker make that a bubble machine maybe something cool all right we're going with the 36 one just because it has two reviews as these better be good reviews my daughter loved it thanks Robby very descriptive you sold me so for two hundred and sixty-four dollars we have everything in cart says it's gonna come by December all right let's wait a little bit we got to order this stuff hopefully it comes in time took about two weeks everything actually did show up it's crazy how magic works well you're thankful right so here's everything all eleven items actually came which is crazy and kind of like a wish first it's great to start with the second season off on a great note of all the items came I can't believe it so we're gonna jump in and start yes with this so it's the turkey hat some of the things you you see online you don't actually know if it's Photoshop or a real product that was what I was thinking and I didn't think this is real but that's why there's reviews so what we're doing is starting off a brand new rating scale wish or dish out of five W's the turkey hat for $14 F says it's a must I'm given to 3w so it's a wish barely barely it almost became a dish it's expensive you can really only wear it like once maybe twice a year I mean obviously Thanksgiving you have that entire week but really after November if it's not Halloween it's just not cool so for item two it's the moon lamp this goes for thirteen bucks as you and I both said we'd grab this let's see if it really looks like the moon haven't been there maybe we'll get there okay Stan just the noise of styrofoam F do you like the noise he's cringing I can see him squirming back there so this is the mood USB cable pretty easy so you I've never said these words in my life you basically need to plug your moon in so plug your moon in like that I imagine it's it's you run the cable through sits on that stand like that you can kind of see some of the detail some of the pores of the moon it's really detailed $13 what is it on to working it's too hard to say is there an on or an off switch on the moon wait is there any charge no - thank you so much helpful job so your moon is already charged that just makes it ten times more fun you don't need to show a chord so check this out turn it on you just tap the bottom check that out it's a mood you want a new color it's October it's November boom it looks like it's just basically 3d printed good all-day detail it definitely looks like you're moving five W's all day every day this thing is a total wish not a dish putting this in your room anywhere in your house it just works in the wood stand it's kind of minimal that's really cool obviously you guys are probably wondering item three we know it's the laser light show I didn't think this was actually gonna show up but what's what's going on with the crossbow we're gonna check across for our last it's the most dangerous I need supervision no supervision is required this is so scary it actually showed up we'll open it up at the end here we go with the laser light show so item three very mini laser projector okay it's got a little bit of setup gotta put this arm on it so oh wow that's sweet you can screw it in somewhere dang wishes got you covered from the screws to the mounts it's like they want you to put this on everyday objects that don't need a laser light show but would look really cool there was hot you could put a laser light show on your car that would be a really bad idea so for 19 bucks let's see how this mini laser projectors just got a DC port on the back oh don't make eye contact just prop it up I see why there's a bunch of holes to mount it somewhere like you need to put it somewhere it just doesn't it doesn't feel welcome just on the table and stand up so you guys can get a little bit of a sneak peek on the table imagine this just projecting turn it you guys let me know what you think let me know in the comments make sure you vote up in the iCard with your favorite item from this video we've got a lot of good stuff this episode so the mini laser projector out of five W's this is getting a four so it's an automatic wish for 19 bucks it works not bad item four are the maple leaves there were three dollars basically they're a must or a bust for Thanksgiving this is either gonna be awesome or there's no point there's this is the biggest waste of three dollars ever so has cut a long cord you can pick the length so led maple leaves for three dollars okay they work and kind of put them places that's actually really cool they're so simple they're battery-powered you could really hide them but I mean they're not really hidden because they have a light you know on the wisher dish scale these are getting like a three they're cool but for three dollars I mean it's three dollars so the gaming at set for twelve dollars did it work so it didn't work actually this would work for a PC but for ps4 ps3 this is not happening the reason is I mean there's a mic there's a headphone jack and then there's a USB port on a ps4 controller there's none of that there's really only one port for headphones so not working didn't even transmit audio through it they're comfortable for twelve dollars we were cool but two out of four double use to dish F if you weren't sold on the $3.00 maple leaves or the laser projector you still want something you're still wanting something for the house boom or the apartment Gared bubble machine thirty-six dollars for this it better have bubbles inside no there's no bubbles no no I should have expected it but I didn't believe it no God please no no no no with the bubble maker didn't think I was actually gonna get bubble bubble liquid bubble solution but just for the power of the switch you have a bubble-maker wish or dish let's say it's definitely like for double use it's pretty cool but I think it's just a little too big for it to be practical it works it's worth it it's definitely a wish look bad it's like an industrial bubble machine this looks to be the ghillie suit so this was $15 you guys know the wish prices are always change going up and down it's linked down below you guys know where it is but a ghillie suit we are fully becoming a hunter is it that the shirt or the pants that's that's the Hat we got the full dang thing all on wish imagine just buying this or trying to find this in store you'd have to go to like a few different shop alright definitely the pants we have the jacket and then the Hat that's the crossbow whoa you get everything with this see this is the rare finds you find on wish that's why we make this that's why you guys wanted the second season I can breathe that's the most important part I can breathe but like all right if I was laying in the grass f totally honest with me here it's a yes or a No do you think you would see I'd say no I don't know if you guys are just hearing a voice right now or if you can see anything but I'm still here this is the greatest 15 dollars ever spent wish dish absolute wish five W's - I'm gonna wear the ghillie suit for the rest of the video you will find me next up is a headlamp you're starting to see the whole Thanksgiving vibe if you want to blend in gotta go get some food for Thanksgiving it makes sense it happened one point in time you're gonna need a headlamp so this is 15 dollars seems like a pretty heavy duty industrial headlamp look at that three bulbs that's three separate people eV and then just do the charge oh that's so sweet boom charges up through the USB core - wow we got you covered is their battery though push the batteries in oh those are some big batteries to f-hole is it big ones feel like a scuba diver for some reason I'm getting mixed emotions I can't tell if I'm on land or if I'm in water I'm going somewhere all right to the headlamp oh that's actually really comfortable just sits against the forehead it's nice it articulates you can move it down it goes like above your eyebrows you're good on your eyebrows it's all comfortable it's accurate to I mean it's on your head so wherever you look it'll follow [Music] okay I feel like a lot of you guys are just gonna hate me it works Wow I'm really shocked for 15 bucks five W's absolute wish no dish this is the backpack took a little bit to find one happiest showed up whoa we got a pretty decent sized backpack I mean if you're running around and like an airsoft fight men this would have been amazing if wish was wish was around when I was young man I've even saying that sounds old dang not a bad backpack fit your headset you're going hunting after all right gotta blend in have you don't keep your got your ghillie suit hat hilarious you'll still blend right on in put that in the bag I mean this is like 40 30 litres hard to measure with wish but it's not bad little compartment for an ID maybe some coins no laptops leave no tablets leave a little tablet maybe tablet up what would you put in here Camelback nice little water bottle boom stay hydrated alright backpack four out of five W's that's a wish these things work and now the moment you've all been waiting for the crossbow it's here even the dart showed up so eight dollars for a pack of pack of darts hard to tell how many there are I think this is a 20-pack $37 for the crossbow I can't believe it actually showed up so here it is the crossbow what do you think it's not loaded don't worry the Safety's right there look at these darts look how sharp that is so to it back you press down on this it's actually difficult but I mean it's a crossbow so once it is cocked back and it takes forever to do it you just push down on this lever after you've held the button and make sure it's pulled all the way back you have your sights not bad at all I mean $37.00 did you think anything was gonna show up I didn't disengage the safety and just like that imagine this on top of this flying that fast my heart I am scared I don't know if you guys saw the fidgets spinner ninja star video I'll leave it linked in the description or in the iCard they don't spit that hurts so much that was cool but you can throw that and control it this week you pull the trigger will launch this ok so here we go the $37.00 crossbow with the darts I just gotta say it now be extremely careful with this so we're gonna shoot the TNT pillow first see what happens Safety's on Safety's off the tip is right here so I'm gonna say it wet in the pillow we had this bowl though and I think if it makes contact with the bowl it should basically bust open all these caps make everything go fly do you guys can get an idea of how fast this sharp dart is traveling like look at that look at all this damage my plane didn't even work obviously the shaft of the dart here's where it made contact this is the entry point actually I think went over and then through because the angle and I'm not here to tell you guys aerodynamics but I am here to say this $37 crossbow whish dish five W's all day this is the greatest thing I have ever bought unwish but the scariest thing so that's it for episode one of wish Buster's Thanksgiving edition let me know in the iCard what your favorite item was for me I gotta say it was the crossbow safety is on just gotta remind myself this thing is crazy I never thought you could actually get a crossbow from wish that would work that definitely could do some damage it is a crazy crazy product everything in this is way crazier than I actually thought and that's just Thanksgiving for you so
