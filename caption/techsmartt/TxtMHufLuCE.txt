so you guys probably have a pair of the Apple earpods they're really awesome they sound alright and they're really convenient but the thing I hate about it you guys too is it's another thing to carry around like keeping track of this ear pods case is really difficult but I found this case on Kickstarter that not only charges your phone because it's like a battery case but it will also charge your air pods so you guys know I love checking out he's interesting and weird Kickstarter and IndieGoGo projects they're awesome and I think I might have found the world's greatest one that actually is practical so this right here is called the pod case I'll leave a link down below if you guys want to check it out now why this case is awesome is it's a battery case so you're gonna get a full iPhone 7 charge and actually on their Kickstarter this is gonna work with the iPhone 7 7 plus and they mention something about the iPhone 8 they haven't updated it yet so I don't know if they know the iPhone 8 has an 8 plus model and also an X model that would be really cool why this is dope though is because you can charge your Apple earpods without needing a case that for me is a huge game-changer let me know in the comments how you guys feel about this and if you own air pods I think they're really awesome but do just carry around this case is so difficult let's try to actually get the battery case part working first so since this is a prototype like this thing is janky it's gonna be a much better final product like duders it's it's just to show you guys that it works I actually need to use a sim tool to get the charge initiated just it's really it's really happy so just like that I don't know if you guys get here but we are actually charging on my iPhone 7 that's really awesome and now for like the coolest part of the case it's an air pod charger I really like this because if you're making a phone call or you're getting a phone call the case is in your pocket you can instead of pulling your phone out you just pull an air pod out put it in your ear and you can take the call think of it like what smartwatches did for the phone but like just a better way to do the whole ear pods thing they're actually talking about putting magnets in the final one but for now they just slide in they don't even look that bad I could actually see myself using a case like this on a daily basis it feels good it looks good I I think it was meant to be so this will actually charge up the air pods I just I kind of like tuck them down and like make sure they're fully flat against the connectors just to show you guys that this actually works I'm gonna show you the air pipes and the charge that have on them right now so I'm going to put them back in the dental-floss case dude this keep a track of this case is so hard I'm so happy there's something that actually exists I'm putting them back in this case just because it's paired to this phone so let's check the percentage I always have the hardest time getting it to pop up so these air pods are at 94% so we're gonna tuck them back in the case here and just to double-check that the case is actually charging we got 81% we're gonna let them sit in there until they charge up 20 minutes late damn and just like that only after a couple of minutes the phone is still charging we're at 85% on here and we got the air pod so let's check the percentage on these ear pods I'm so excited for this case oh it's gonna be the coolest thing ever and they're actually on Kickstarter they still need fun if you guys are checking out link down below it starts off at 79 bucks early bird version a battery case air pod charger USB Steve like this might be the world's first USB see charging case which would be really awesome but let's check the percentage on these things and just like that we are at 99 percent just after a few minutes of charging that sounds really awesome now the last thing I really want to try is what they showed in the video and that's actually taking a call while leaving your phone in your pocket just with these air pods so let's try that so we got the iPhone sevens number put into my 7 plus and I'm gonna blur all the numbers right now except one let me know in the comments if you can guess my number call it if any of you guys get it right I'll actually talk to you so let's give this a shot that call says the air pods are connected cuz they're connected to multiple devices so tech smarts Colin the grab the air pod hello hello we got a mad echo going on right now you guys can see unconnected to the Apple earpods all right I'm gonna go in another room you guys this case is really cool I don't know if I mentioned this yet but inside the case there is a 2500 milliamp hour battery so that I'll fully charge up your iPhone 7 no problem or even charge these air pods up to 40 times which is pretty crazy so this case is pretty much solved the whole dental floss carrying case issue I lose these a lot now the only other issue I wish we could have solved let me know in the comments if you guys have any ideas but it's if you lose one air pod what do you do I know there's like a fine my air pod kind of thing but I wish like I hope these magnets are so strong you'll never lose them that's it and I hope they make it for the iPhone X all right I mean temperature shout-out time I wanna give a huge shout out to Ahmed and made for having my notifications on it's super simple all you guys gotta do is make sure you subscribe I've been hit that Bell icon soo notified when a brand new video drops and let me know in the comments so I give you guys a shout out make sure you guys check out don't buy a glitter iPhone case and I'll see you guys later peace today we learned some math in the YouTube
