hey what's good guys welcome back to techsmartt and this is a super crazy and special video kind of like all videos and the reason is for one of them we got been so bent on the camera right now guys and right now he's actually gonna be the overhead camera to give you guys more details this is a special video because this is a hundred and twenty one dollar fake iphone 10's max how bad is it the series you guys all know and love last year I made $125 fake iPhone 10 how bad is it if you missed that it's right up there in the iCard or link down below if you want to check it out and get all caught up to speed but in front of me we have a real iPhone tennis max in gold bed just came out we're in Australia we picked that up definitely check out that playlist right up there if you guys want to see more content on that and then a fake iphone 10's max that I picked up online for a hundred and twenty one dollars so let's get down to it and see what the key differences are you guys know what the series is about so sit back relax we're gonna so this particular fake iPhone 10 has a few similar specs in different specs and we'll just get started so on the Box definitely make sure to check out the back this is always gonna be a key difference that you need to look for the stickers are on a line or if things don't seem to be even so iPhone 10 plus there's no plus it should be called the max the image on the box is also something to note I'm a real tennis max it's kind of got this new earthy trippy kind of color look it's more purple it's more yellow but checking out the fake one because this is the one that you guys really want to see and the one that I'm super excited to check out see how good it really is you know every year they do get better so opening this up we have some info kind of like normal we get inside just a faded tips guide then a SIM card tool then the fake iPhone 10's max and I actually got it in white not even the gold one but the gold one is available you guys want to check that out you know where the link is so let's see the accessories we get we get some ear plugs in a tin whoa thought I had a headphone jack it actually has a a lightning connector so kinda interesting the fakes are getting better and then a super sketchy doesn't look very trustworthy or good so now to check out the real iPhone 10's max the one in gold one thing to really pay attention to is the front image make sure it's the kind of this globe you won't be able to see the notch on the screen that's what Apple's trying to hide it still exists just you don't see it on the front box so when you look at the back of it you're gonna see everything pretty much makes sense iPhone XS Mac's earpods with lightning connector and then obviously tennis max gold and then the gigabyte capacity all the stickers look to be in line pretty much proper this is the real phone so let's open it up got designed by Apple in California so you get a Hello guide this actually should pull out and you should be getting three separate tabs so good to note then we got a SIM card tool love when they include these and then the Apple stickers always good to know when these come in although I think I have just way too many so this is what I've been really excited for the iPhone 10's max so this is it in gold well check this out and compare it to the fake ones see what's up so here's what else we get in the box basically I'm in Australia right now if you're in the US you're gonna get one that looks a little different then we have this new style of earpods it kind of wraps around it's not that plastic thing like before so keep that in mind and then a cable at the bottom now it's kind of the fun part let's turn on both of these phones at once see if they look alike so actually vote up in the iCard real quick which phone you guys think is real and which phone you guys think is fake number one or number two and let me know in the comments if you guys guess right this is what both bones look like it honestly they both kind of feel pretty similar I thought when I first picked up a fake phone and it of course is the white one so if you guys got a sneak peek at that you did guess right fake and the gold one is the real one now there are three colors to keep in mind you have the silver the Space Gray and then the new gold one this year so that's just for the 10s 10's max and they basically feel the same they look the same on the back there's no new markings or anything in particular saying it's a 10s or XS both say iPhone on the back so that's one thing you're gonna definitely have to be careful of cameras look pretty much the same nothing new to note on the sides here volume buttons mute switch test that the buttons they feel clicky that's a good sign both feel pretty clicky so not that easy to distinguish both cut away the same which I'm really shocked with last year's iPhone 10 and 125 dollar fake iPhone 10 video it was really light and cheap and you could kind of tell but this year it basically feels the exact same in weight so let's turn these things on and see what looks different so the fake phone should be running Android 7 kind of powers on with an interesting boot screen there shouldn't be a bezel on any fake phone it should just be all screen that's kind of what you're paying for both of these have a 6.5 inch screen or so they say the real one obviously does the fake one has this kind of interesting black border that goes around it so weird that there's kind of this shadow on the corners of the screen guess that's what you get fake one is finally booted up it says open Wi-Fi networks available iOS system so swipe up to unlock it's kind of laggy and slow keep that in mind when you are checking this out before you hand them your money or you go ahead and leave the deal I've you seen on the real one absolutely butter when you go ahead and swipe up so we can just go right into I guess taking a selfie you see how good these cameras are so on the real one first then on the fake one not bad not bad at all we actually tried to charge up the fake iPhone as Max and to kind of our surprise and started to charge and now it's no longer charging so the final battery on this phone in the 20% so we basically got a rush to this video no joke here we go let's fully get into this because it's actually pretty interesting between the real 10s max the fake one and the differences so at the bottom you can immediately tell there is an antenna on the real one compared to the fake one where there is nothing and then when you go to maps this is crazy what is this when I go to maps here it's just regular Apple maps if you just click the maps app it should take you to regular maps and that's something I think that's in Mandarin I don't know let me know in the comments you guys know better obviously another thing is the App Store sometimes it's cloned really well other times it just sucks it's the Play Store I gotta give it to it the App Store doesn't look that bad what do you guys think just kidding we got a Facebook pop-up thank God think we know what the answer is there am i right what's that exit out of it so let's check out find my friends and see what this looks like powered by a map calm so that seems to be the GPS and map provider on the fake phone compared to the real one would you use iCloud so you can obviously sign in there just swiping up does not feel natural at all super at for battery percent 14 percent we're just fully going here gasps Anna completely from 100 down to zero and empty this phone probably will never charge again so let's enjoy it while it lasts so normally I would try to watch a YouTube video on a fake phone pair to a real phone see how the screen is camera looks pretty good but I'm just gonna see if the YouTube app works on here this app isn't compatible with your phone I can't even watch a YouTube video so I'm just gonna do that on the 10s max and see how good it looks why not all right let's see what the tech smart giveaway video looks like I'm giving away for iPhone 10s Max's in gold so if you guys want to check that out for three million subscribers thank you so much by the way we're almost there Jeff I do that link down below or up in the iCard crazy stuff here we go with YouTube even load this phones getting so hot don't even know what browser this thing's running it's lagging ridiculously hard I got both giveaway videos cued up right here no ad on the fake one I don't like him at I can't fullscreen it it's that fake in the phone doesn't look all that bad I'm the real one obviously it looks much more crisp 6.5 inch OLED to screen that's amazing on the 10s I don't think you can look at colors fully just trying to see via get the YouTube app basically I think you guys can fully tell what makes the phone real and what makes it fake it's lagging a whole lot here and that's kind of what makes it a fake phone and you can't even charge it so as long as you can charge it and download YouTube and the camera doesn't look that crappy think you're in good shape so this is something kind of interesting to note and actually bring your laptop's you to Craigslist or wherever you're doing this deal basically plug the phone into a computer this is gonna be a dead giveaway if it's a fake phone or if it's not you want to plug it in you guys can see it says do you want to trust this computer it says trust or mistrust it actually should say trust or don't trust and that would be shown on the real 10s max if you were to plug it into the community so while the regular four-night is downloading on the real iphone Tenace max I actually found a fort mint battle 3d in whatever App Store this is I don't really think it's the Google Play Store it's some own version I had to plug it in again this phone is starting to die so graphics don't look yep they look actually pretty bad it says fortnight battle royale and has a pretty high res icon at the bottom what it looks like a bootleg version it looks really good it looks like low res graphics to make you not believe that it has high res graphics so it looks like there's a fake fort night game there's no way to really cancel out of that so if for tonight doesn't really exist and take a long time to download kind of like you see here it's two gigabytes that's definitely a good sign that your phone is probably fake as sad as that is it's true it's fun game you might see me on there's tech smart but men does this game take forever to download I guess that's a good thing so for tonight finally loaded up we're gonna hit play for that it just looks too good on the iPhone 10 that's max time to see you can get some kills we're getting ready to drop we're gonna go where everyone else is gone you can get a kill definitely looks like it's pretty good quality I would say it probably looks as good as pretty much any other display with good graphics no way no way I gotta kill my pickaxe Bend whoa no well I gotta killed my pickaxe so as you guys can see I got one kill in fortnight on the 10s max I had a lot of fun graphics look really good I definitely think graphics on the new tennis and tennis max really look amazing with the new a 12 Bionic chip that's definitely new this year for the iPhones so between the real versus the fake excited this one needing to be plugged into a computer because it's so pretty hot and it looks really ridiculously fake you're gonna be able to tell just by plugging this thing in looking at the settings and I don't see messing around with it for about five minutes which phone is fake and which one is real but that's it for this video if you guys are new make sure you subscribe by clicking that button right down there and check out two other videos right over here of a drop test in water test on the brand new tennis and tennis max it's crazy you guys are definitely to be surprised that's gonna do it and I'll see you guys next time peace
