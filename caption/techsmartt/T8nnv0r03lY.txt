hey with you guys exactly what you know is about to happen so we're gonna do a drop test with the brand new iPhone 10 are this thing just came out yesterday pretty crazy they made a $750 iPhone the same year as the thousand dollar but now $1100 iPhone 10s or 10s max if you want to get that extra screen size you got to pay an extra $100 for it the reason we're making this video is with the iPhone 10 R it has an aluminum build with the 10s right here it has steel so the same is the 2017 iPhone 10 you guys know who did it dropped to us with the iPhone 10s versus - 10 vs 10 s max if you missed that it's right up there in the iCard or link down below to the massive iPhone playlist don't click it there's just too much stuff in there so we're gonna find out for the 250 dollar difference here in 2018 is there a noticeable difference where you drop your phone late at night you're gonna be sorry the reason why this drop test in 2018 is such a big deal because this is the first year Apple has released an aluminum and a stainless steel phone both fresh and new it's called the 10r for a reason right so what's actually new with the 10 are one of the new things you can get are six different colors black there's white there's yellow there's coral there's red and there's blue I think that's pretty cool especially because you're spending a lot of money black silver and gold that's just for a different crowd we're cooler spec wise this thing has the exact same processor it's the 10s or 10s max so you're set with the new a 12 the only difference is three gigabytes of RAM in here so if you're switching between apps a lot doing a lot of photo editing you know being a real person you might notice a difference so you're obviously getting what you pay for this thing's $250 cheap also in the 10r is a new screen so it's a 6.1 inch screen size matters I actually like the bigger size because it's not 6.5 inches or 5.8 it's kind of a nice comfortable size and that's all due to Apple's supply chain this was only possible to 2018 because the iPhone 10 happened last year in 2017 so there's a 6.1 inch screen with the biggest difference being quality of display so on the tennis the tennis max and even the 2017 iPhone 10 there is an OLED panel with the iPhone 10 are there is an LCD so that's how they're saving some money here and you can even see a little bit the bezels aren't as thin as the 10s or 10s max and that's all because the LCD tech here the largest change that makes this video so important is the aluminum so on the tennis tennis max sevices beginning there is aluminum on the 10r so if you're going to go ahead and drop test them will be aluminum d'un worse than you steel it's kind of a big question the glass on the 10r is the same as the new redesign glass on the 10s and 10's max supposedly more durable and the reason I'm not checking out the 10 asks because you guys already know about it I did a drop test which is right up there in the iCard and real quick before we get to dropping these things you guys can see that the tennis is actually a little smaller than the 10r and I kind of like the 10 hour sides it's got a little bit bigger of a screen it's comfortable it's not huge like my 10s max so not if you guys want to see more on the 10r I unbox all the colors thread up there in the iCard really crazy taste the rainbow right so while we're gonna be doing the strap test is from fixed lengths in the first fight it's gonna be from pocket level arms locked see if there is any difference over aluminum with steel starting with the iPhone 10 are this aluminum dropping so that landed on the corner feel a little bit of scuffing on the edge of the glass where I'm guessing it rolled on the bottom we have our contact point so you can see with the aluminum being anodized too and maybe this will be a reason why you don't want to get a blue coral or yellow phone maybe just the white one is when you drop it it's gonna show marks and it's gonna show the silver aluminum underneath what could you expect that was the iPhone 10 are from the pocket level drop now let's try out the iPhone 10s or the tennis so wrapping the pocket height in three two that's where in the corner you can kind of just smudge it away with your finger and I don't know about you but that Punk's not noticeable there's a little chip not as bad as the aluminum on the 10r yeah honestly 10s takes damage like a champ I think it's cause of the stainless steel that was dropped one tennis held up way better the NR as aluminum and I'm very nervous for this next job so we're gonna be doing the call height drop but keeping it more accurate than ever I'm just gonna hold my arm out again 63 that hasn't changed we're gonna be dropping this to kind of simulate a call but keeping it more consistent so dropping the 10r oh wow it's actually and separating from the aluminum frame could be interesting sees how d-10 art is built and if it's built as well as the 10s but you guys can see the glass is actually lifting a little bit on this corner here I'm not even gonna peel its frame and I'm pretty confident if I hit that corner one more time not only is the glass shattering but it's probably coming off the phone and it's look at the camera is it actually slid you got another damage point on the top right and the cameras actually got a little bit of scuffing let me try to take a photo still looks good even though it's got one camera not to like the 10s I'm really shocked the glass hasn't cracked given how severe that last drop was from head height oh boy this is exactly the reason why we're making this video because chances are you might be buying the new iPhone tower and not know that it's starting to fray a little bit so with the 10s I think I know what to expect this thing's gonna be a champ stainless steel so let's do a shoulder high drop that's a low blow whoa what the heck is that it took a chunk out of the screen I have never seen this ever in a drop test I've seen screens break a scene displays break I've not seen the display and screened not break but proper chip like I think if you went to Chipotle they wouldn't charge you extra for this that's a new one we also have some damage on the upper right corner here and then the impact zone which I'm shocked it didn't just shattered the screen right there that's steel for you then on the back it's perfect perfectly functional there's a little bit of your display missing but that's what we call weight reduction this video has been full of surprises we have a 10 s that is chipped we have a 10 R that is maybe chipping definitely chipping the glass on the back is lifting from the frame so I don't know what this next drop test is gonna look like but it could be the one that kills the 10 R or I will at least we're gonna do it from above the head iPhone 10 R and 3 2 that landed display first him shot you can see the display absolutely took a beating it's got white scuffs all around it but it did not crack that crack that we saw on the pocket level drop the first drop test he thought of the horse but I think the chip only deepened and it didn't actually spread all these whole week are you serious all these white scuffs you can't smudge away really you see if I can get rid of them so some you can most you can this is now the iPhone 10 are after three drops you can tell your phone screen has taken damage which I guess is better than not having a cracked and non-functional phone but not something I'd like to see every day and definitely why you put a screen protector on this before you might on the 10s there's only one way to find out about that one though so the iPhone 10 Arg is showing some scuffs on the screen I don't expect that with the 10s I'm just expecting if it hits the screen first it will just shatter that's like most iPhone tens and most iPhones right so let's be proven wrong hopefully dropping the iPhone 10s from above the head Oh No so it made contact on the back first on the back corner right there oh and it cracked the front they took a screenshot when I dropped it that hard I think it saved you might be covered because we have evidence now obviously when you drop your iPhone on a corner or at least the tennis and you guys saw this on the drops if you missed it check out that I card but this is what's gonna happen you're gonna have a chip in your display front screens crack your back now crack your glass I don't know if it's the rigidity of the stainless steel that's causing these impacts because on the 10r I would say it took a worse drop and I don't want to say it but this bones crack this one works and is it cracked here we are here we have it the iPhone 10s for $1000 hold the front screen and then the back glass shed phone still works you could get away with it there might be a weird chip if you drop it at the wrong angle but surprisingly the real banger here is the iPhone 10 arm it's got that extended release not only in the battery life but that extended release in the streets you guys saw we did the same drop test you both these phones one is stainless steel the other is aluminum and I'm not a scientist or a medalist but I would say because the 10r has aluminum and that is more of a flexible metal than steel it actually benefits this device in the long run you guys saw the three drops do you see a crack on the screen or on the back yeah there's a few markings on the front but I'll take a few markings on the front versus a crack on the front one is getting me a number the other they're just not gonna take my phone so that's it for the iPhone 10 are I'm gonna say it now this is the most durable phone Apple's made in a very long time and for real going into this I didn't think the iPhone 10 R was gonna last I thought this would be the cheapest phone in the drops and honestly in your pocket but a phone that can last is the phone that I want pretty good battery life too better than the 10s and and uh smacks from what everyone's saying and yeah the screen is a little lower res but I'm focusing on the price I say $250 where fifty of that I could actually spend and get not a 64 gigabyte but 128 gigabyte so for 800 bucks all up and in you can get the perfect iPhone 10 are 128 gigs of storage and a phone that as you guys can see will actually last you guys have seen enough
