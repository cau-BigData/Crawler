[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with you guys keep here so I'm so stoked because right now I'm in the middle of nowhere like usual and I brought two cars with me we got the brand-new 2018 Tesla Model 3 [Applause] and just compare it to something I got a 2016 tesla model s p90d I'm so stoked to be here finally with the model free let's race [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I don't know if you guys can tell this but I love the model 3 you guys been seeing it all over the insta story this car is bomb if you haven't had a chance to sit in one or test-drive one head to your Tesla dealership and do it or Tesla pickup store I'm still new to this whole car thing and before I go any further I want to let you guys know this is just my first impressions I'm in no way shape or form a car review or check out Doug tomorrow or some other Tesla Model 3 reviews if you guys want something a little more accurate this is just my first experience I am digging the Tesla Model 3 first up is this sunroof it's huge I didn't think it was gonna be this big but now I wish my Audi had this I love how it goes all the way back I love everything in the interior the one thing that I'm not a huge fan of is this one vent right here it's where the a/c comes out there's technically like two vents in there I just wish it was a little bit more directional that's one thing I like when it's a hot summer's day here in California and coming off the tennis court I like to be able to put that is that a person walking in the desert dude I thought I saw a person oh well that could have been bad steering wheel I didn't think I would like from the photos it looks too simple I like having all my buttons on my s5 but I don't mind this there's just two buttons so you can raise the steering column and with these buttons you control everything on this car from changing a steering wheel position to the music now it's really sweet about this infotainment system is it's touchscreen and it's not coming off here I do want to know if someone accidentally gets into a Tesla Model 3 classroom from clash crash hopefully there's no fatalities but if you hit your head against here how's that gonna go is it rigid enough to break your head or will it flex if like a head comes through these are the things I asked myself and quickly bought up in the iCard let me know which car you guys think is gonna win back the infotainment system so it has LTE Bluetooth and everything in this car is controlled through here so the locks or the ambient lighting it's all controlled through here headlights you can turn off ambient lights turn off display you can actually adjust the brightness surprise surprise and add a bunch of different modes auto pilot so the particular model that I got here I actually rented it on an app called churro leave a link down below if you want to use my referral code just gets me free car credits I would love it it helps me pick up girls so this particular model doesn't have the auto pilot on which kind of sucks I was really trying to try that out and the model s doesn't have it either and this isn't a rear-wheel drive model these are the only ones that are shipping right now the 310-mile capacity so not too bad everything you can control and here you have your defrosters seat warmers musics kind of dope so I had the navigation set up here and then Keaton's iPhone so let's play something so since you have a 15 inch display navigation is beautiful on here so Tesla uses Google Maps and just check out this interface look how gorgeous that looks and all these red dots here are superchargers so say you want to go on a road trip you can map your road trip based on where superchargers are so you're never without a charge it's solid dude I love everything about this now the interior is pretty dope too it's not actually leather I don't find much of a difference compared to my s5 which has quilted leather in it there's all Cantera on these side panels here it's not better this sunroof I do feel a little warm because of it now when I first saw Elon unveiled a Model 3 at a base price of $35,000 I was skeptical because a small car I love the Model S I didn't think it would live up to the hype and it looked like a small car on stage I'm a 6th floor dude these seats aren't moved I haven't moved them at all and I can fit comfortably in this car I'm not eating my knees I do like to eat the knees I have enough Headroom I feel like it could be 6 6 6 7 I still got room to grow I'm still growing so if you're down for that let me know Wow like this car is blown away all my expectations [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that you guys have seen both cars just telling you now if you can already tell the model 3 is my personal favorite so the particular model for you that I got is the 310 mile range with real real Drive and that's gonna do 0 to 60 so they claim in 4.8 seconds whereas the 2016 Tesla Model S 90 D will do 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds it doesn't have ludicrous mode so I'm pretty pumped drop away give you guys all the model free to win we're about to race these things I think the model 3 is gonna pull it off [Music] oh I smoke them all taken out oh yeah oh yeah baby over oh my god oh wow I'd be in the sixty for sure what [Music] okay so I had a false start I gotta admit that about the race Joe rocked me with the Model S really fast so I had a hundred and probably what like six seconds it wasn't bad really smooth ride to my surprise I've been loving this car it's plenty fast I want to trade in my howdy s v drop a like in the video you guys are gonna check that out and show you guys what I currently drives I am so surprised Wow I thought it would be much closer but he just rocked me I lost the race I don't feel good about it this cars fast oh you guys that's furniture for this video man this wind is going faster than we were that's gonna do it make sure you guys get subscribe if
