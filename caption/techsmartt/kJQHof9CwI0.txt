crushing item for $17 for this thing ooh this is spider oh man this is a sweet spot of mine so let me just give you the backstory I have lost 25 pairs of Apple earpods I even got one in my pocket because I have remembered so air pods I love these things to death you guys have might have checking about let me know the comments have you've ever picked up a pair or if you've ever lost a pair here's how this goes so it's an iPhone air pods and Apple watch Stan ah hostile food if this is good ever and buy this in the description this is a hole as long as it doesn't suck just don't suck so it's just basically a rubber stand that you need to push lightning cables through so all the cables will be consolidated right here at the bottom so super-clean on your nightstand or on your desk looks pretty discreet put your ear pods here bone goes here and then the Apple watch charger goes right there oh that is a tight fit oh whoa that just wow okay we got one this is for the iPhone now we're gonna do one to the air pods my Apple watch charger I only have one but as well my first week back on the Apple watch game there we go so as you guys can see with the Apple watch charger I would just put the puck there run the cable down and everything is tucked away normally I would have all this clean so it looks good on the desk but let's see if it works so air pods first ah yeah buddy that is awesome so since it's so sturdy and as you saw me struggling you can dock your hair 5 to pull them up dock them pull it up pop lock and drop it nothing is gonna move let's try the iPhone ok now the iPhone is charging it works 17 bucks so Josh right now is got three pops one swap apparently item number five $20 what did you get me Josh oh no way no way this is $20 but worth every dollar Janey or Laurel quickly vote up in the iCard which you think it is Jonnie or Laurel I think it sounds like Laurel I'll be honest oh wait no it sounds like Laurel to me it could sound like yani to you vote up in the iCard absolutely worth it Josh for pops water flop item six is a hundred eight bucks what did you give you Josh I appreciate you walking over and then just to set head delivering this one he throws it can do two and one notebook tablet by RCA I have checked out more of their tablets in the weird shopping Best Buy or if you guys seen the five-minute speed shopping they make some good tablets I've never bought one that's more than I think thirty dollars so this thing is a 10 inch display 32 gigs of storage dual cameras 2 gigs of RAM and up to six hour battery life and it's running Windows 10 shoe what is this so it's a two-in-one it's got these prongs here so this is the keyboard part you can use it as a tablet or is a full-fledged laptop or a docks nicely one speaker at the bottom feels kinda hefty so maybe this thing can tack a punch HDMI set microUSB not to charge it right the charge port power on button and USB 3.0 it's a USB port we gotta be thankful some just don't even include that when this thing fully powers up it's doing its thing right now apparently on the keyboard section there's no real trackpad it's all capacitive so there's no vibration there's no feedback you just have to look at the screen to see if you're actually clicking something we're scrolling around I didn't sign up for this it's really easy to press the power button on the side just I've done that twice accidentally okay we got some apps Josh I got minecraft on here for you I kind of like this so umm on YouTube seems to scroll just fine this thing could do light work I witnessed our video editing on it or editing photos or really anything that's graphic intensive let's try to find the fourth episode of popper flop and remember this thing only has two gigabytes of RAM so I'm guessing it's gonna be slow the quality's not bad definitely an HD screen alright let's shut this kid up oh and the mouse pad mouse pad the trackpad she's me the trackpad oh it's like a regular trackpad click just by tapping you have you this thing you're getting rich just getting rich off the series you want the series to keep going don't you last item Josh oh oh oh he pulled it out of the box how much is this fifteen dollars final item let's go boom yes sir I have seen this I think I've yep I have checked one of these out this is a USB programmable fan simple 15 bucks and basically you can program the message fan blades spin with powerful swing on maybe this $108 two-in-one it's much better than we thought and it is so to customize this you have to download some
