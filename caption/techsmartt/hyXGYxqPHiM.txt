hey what's you guys welcome back to tech smart and right in front of me is the craziest backpack you're ever gonna see in your life and you want to know the best part of its made by Xiaomi that's right the smartphone company they just came out with the poco phone if you guys missed that it's right up there in the iCard they also make a bunch of other gadgets and a few other phones like the me mix two shall me you guys probably heard of them they're not making backpacks so this is the Xiaomi geometric backpack if you want to check it out it's linked down below it's not expensive but was I so surprised when it finally showed up so the backpacks kind of got is geometric design and I actually found this on youtube from Galaxy app so I'll leave this video link down below or right up there in the iCard if you want to check it out I was really just intrigued by a thumbnail I watch a lot of YouTube am i right so it goes for around 73 bucks and this is just the coolest looking backpack I've seen for seventy-three dollars but you know what I'm going through it now I travel a lot you guys probably do too you're in school you need a good backpack that can fit everything you want your laptop your tablet just all your jazz and right now I think this could be it so let's check this out this is sweet so you got a top zipper here with some pretty nice pull tabs easy to recognize and you're not gonna have your fingers to slip awesome no zippers are gonna break in whoa so this is just pocket one keep that in mind and check this out right hopping into this backpack it is crazy so I've never seen this before but at the top there's actually a headphone hanger so what you could do is just grab a pair of headphones do that so when I'm traveling I usually use the Bose QuietComfort 35 those things are the heat you know it let me know in the comments if you guys have ever tried it but the eighty HM 50s can't go wrong and this is kind of crazy it's got a pretty thick headband and just check out how well this strap actually holds it it's got velcro so it'll hold your headphones and actually suspend them check this out I love the emphasis for this so seriously it's awesome your headphones if they kind of adjust and fold down they're gonna be able to suspend and not get crushed which I don't know about you I've actually had a few pairs of headphones get crushed ruined this kind of saves it and it keeps him in a spot where you know where they are and they're secure but let me just show you more so there's this zippered compartment here and I really like all the orange accents on the bag so you got black design with this geometric shape and kind of this gray in line here so good aesthetic pretty minimal colors and then this orange it just hits yeah and it looks so good so you got pretty good space you can put whatever cables I'd like to keep it super organized when I travel as much as I can so cable ties there everything EV you guys will see the full rundown on IG TV oh and this is really cool so you have this kind of zippered pocket and this is pretty rad so it's this like felt pocket almost reminds something you'd find I'm like a supersoft Costco blanket you know what I'm talking about it's those MADD soft ones like 30 bucks but these will keep your sunglasses perfectly safe since it's got this really soft felt it's not gonna scratch the glass lenses it's gonna keep your frames intact and cuz your headphones are hanging and they're not just going everywhere they're not gonna crush your glasses seriously this glasses pocket is one of the most ingenious pockets I've ever seen on a backpack it's why this is my favorite like for 75 bucks this seems perfectly goes for like 73 so you've got some deep space in here like you could go to outer space freaking explore the entire thing and this is just part one of the bag you got enough for notebooks your headphones whatever you want remember this actually protrudes out so since it goes outwards you can stack this with as much as you want and it'll only just expand but wait a minute just you wait please literally just wait I love these zippers they got this nice thick zip and what's cool about this and this is what Xiaomi claims is the bag is waterproof resistant and because and I actually believe it these zipper enclosures have this kind of rubber protection it's got this like a seal so when you zip you actually seal the zipper up as opposed to just doing the zipper so I'm guessing that's kind of what waterproof sit I'm gonna dump a bunch of water on here with everything inside but it gets even better and check this out on this side EV this is kind of where the main goodies are where your entire backpack is gonna be this is where you can see the laptop I got my MacBook Pro some notebooks few other pockets but starting at the top wow this is just crazy it's got a nice deep pouch for like pens pencils SD cards whatever you need speaking of D cards why would you put them in there when you just move your notebooks and then you actually get your own SD card slots you get this app you get your own SD card slots and there's these like cutouts where it doesn't go all the way through so it's not a charging cable well you could put like I got because I always lose them I have a USB a two well almost lost it am i right got to keep it in the backpack I got a USB a two USBC adapter because I always need to convert it's not a perfect world just yet and it's a pretty good movie just having kind of like this row right here I wish more backpacks did it you know where everything is it's all outlined awesome and then you have these other pockets and they have like Mouse icons so that's the one sweet thing about Xiaomi since they're like a tech company this backpack literally tells you everything and where it should go so here you got this kind of like mouse icon put a wireless mouse you got another one down there I'm in this zip pocket I mean kind of this just deep space for notebooks whatever you want it's your backpack that's why they give you so much space for it I'm just like crazy about this backpack I haven't seen one that has this much space but doesn't look like it's just a camping trip you know if you go backpacking for like a week or a month you typically only are able to bring like one backpack and everything you can fit in it and this is basically that for me I can fit as much tech as I want to bring like this is supposed to be the tablet pocket but I'm actually rocking my Nintendo switch so I've been playing a bunch of super Ballmer it's the only thing I'm good at and then kind of what you would expect be laptop pocket so I got my macbook pro to sixteen with touch bar still hang it in there did get a repair but what I love about this is just you got that same felt from the glasses pocket outlining the entire thing in orange so it looks really good you got the Xiaomi logo there in orange I just like colors in a minimalist design and then kind of on the inside it points everything out and orange you can't miss it like me right you can tell there's some orange padding back here so to kind of keep the backpack having a structure like this just makes sense man I really like this for only 72 bucks dude you found your new back-to-school backpack I know school might have just started for you but it's time to reconsider like do business a perfect tech guys backpack you have as much pockets for anything that you want and the one thing that I don't totally get is they say it's water-resistant but like who's gonna test that who in the right mind is gonna just pour a bunch of water on this water-resistant backpack all right I guess I'm that crazy guy so boat up in the iCard what'd you guys think of this backpack and if it's actually waterproof I think that's pretty sweet only one way to find out though everything's still in here like this isn't even gonna cut whoa it's deflecting water you can see it alright let's let's shake this off please save my laptop no clickbait you got this ready up pull the zippers boom everything is dry doesn't work ever think you've seen enough let's see if the Nintendo switches okay these zippers held up really well so I'm guessing this entire fraud enclosure is well nice dropped in attendance which that's perfectly dry I don't want to say I'm ShamWow but dang I'm saying WOW every time Wow wow that was not even supposed to happen after I just Vince from ShamWow did what I realized is I'm a bottom there's almost like this leather like aqua reflecting but absorbing material I don't know what it totally is and the entire contents up here which you saw F touched and pretty much not even three bottles of water could affect just drive and that's pretty cool Xiaomi makes an $8 backpack that's right an $8 backpack so this goes for 72 bucks and it's pretty great imagine what 1/9 of that cost is and I didn't even think that math was right but I think it's right there 1 9 $8 backpack what is it's good drop alike if you guys want me to check that out but that's it for this video if you guys liked it make sure to drop a like and get subscribed if
