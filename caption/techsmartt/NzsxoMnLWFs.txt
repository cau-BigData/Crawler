hey what's good guys welcome back to tech smart and you guys can probably tell I got two special guests next to me this is dead and Lincoln from what's inside so that video actually maids link in the description or right up there in the iCard this video is a brand new series you guys know I love my series but this is called a tech top five [Music] so basically ads picked out a bunch of stuff on the internet and in this video we're gonna be checking out the world's top 5 weirdest iPhone cases like I just feel crazy saying it ever are you ready what did you find yeah let's do it and some of these are actually from older videos so basically we have one big bin in the office it's filled with a million weird iPhone cases okay so these are in no particular order and vote up in the iCard which case you guys think was the craziest and most weird from this video and at the end Dan and Lincoln are gonna say it I just who's gonna use it who likes it never I'm not I'm not a pop tart kind of guy but do look at that Lincoln it's the perfect pink pop-tart what was that thing over dude like what's seventh grade be like if you were talking on your phone is this more France or less friends doesn't really look like a F did you know this was a pop star when you bought this I thought it was slime slime interesting scale of 1 to 10 how weird is this 10 being the most weird you've ever seen yeah I'll say a six too because I don't know what the heck I'm looking at here that's gonna be some special so a six and seven out of Lincoln and Dan I give this thing like a four I mean it's cool but I know ever got some more stuff cooking and yeah it's a pop-tart case like it's kind of weird case number two whoa have you guys seen this before looks so bulky though so this along with everything else linked in the description this goes for 32 bucks it's really hard to find this I want the case to go around the phone not the phone just barely but it's so big what the heck does it do like what is this try opening that thing up it's the Ferrari clone case so I actually made a video on this so this is one that I knew about but you guys like that's why I do this because I want you to check this out and I want you to I want you to smell it so we're gonna go check this out you ready yes oh you spray like that we're pulling the thing apart of course we take it apart so it's really fragrant I don't know if this is my scent maybe it's dance right it's I like Ferrari but this cologne smell I don't know it kind of contrasts what Ferrari is and like the luxury this smells like $30 cologne so scale wanna ten boys what do you think one being the least weird and being the weirdest thing you've ever seen in your life that's why I'm giving it a six I'm excited they're starting to get it we got more weird F case 300 so what do you think this is called and well okay look at all that breakage is all like a murse case or a satchel case or a backpack please definitely a first case I represent and boom okay that's pretty cool so it's an actually purse I with cards in it the first car this is stylin and dial-in hashtag whoa cool all right so everybody right now in the comments make sure you use hashtags Island and Island I think it would be cool if this thing wasn't here like a wallet kiss yeah see like a function on your case that makes it so you can store stuff what was your store in there that's just a schedule for school we're going with that okay go with that I'm moving this down to a four on the weird scale that's my reading Lincoln five I'm giving this a six a it's cool okay this is weird could you rock it like yeah it's one you get a wallet in there too so scale one time I mean in a good way in a good way it's like a three all right here we go case for F blow their minds this one sapota minds and basically we have five minutes to go into Best Buy Walmart and other stores and buy the cool weird stuff yeah so I was looking at Best Buy and you guys probably know where the cases are you seen them let me know in comments if you guys have ever seen something like this they literally and I kid you not had it hanging on the shelf in a plastic bag it was in the weird shopping video so this is a Kate Spade iPhone 10 case and this came out like a week after the iPhone 10 dropped so I guess someone really didn't like it so this they were selling this for 32 bucks in a bag in a bag bag not even like eighteen dollars or ten bucks and like a bin or whatever no I'm the shelf where I could see it you can see it it made it in the video you guys tell me what you think about man it's a nice case and rest in peace to Kate Spade I miss you so much that's just so that's history I like the case I like a case yeah yeah the best part about it is it blocks like the Ziploc yeah I wanted the Ziploc okay so it's a tight fit okay I like it so far but hey where's my bag who we kidding yeah this is the case is it this is like a new thing how weird is this case I could see people like when I was rocking their Supremes walking down the street in LA like this yeah it does would you would you have this case so let's say you're at Best Buy and you see the bag you're like me you say you need it would you do it or do the stars kind of go go alright scale one to ten how weird and I'm gonna have two scores here okay the case itself and then the back the case itself there's probably 50 bucks at one point that is weird that's a good story that's a really good story like you gotta give it a 9 or a 10 just for the story that is solid the case I'm giving it a 1 oh this was top 5 nicest cases so get a 10 so here's a 10 here's a 1 let's give it a 5 aggregate all right I'm giving the Kate Spade case and just because Kate Spade's no longer with us I'm giving this a 6 this is art for the Ziploc this gets the world's first on tech top 5 and 11 oh man this is the weirdest case ever and the best part is it actually has Best Buy labels like I could just full-on that's sure rock it like this return it maybe rip the label off and get a different bag open box item you yeah like it's an open box item but really that's solid that's solid it's definitely my favorite so far that's just a ziplock but the reason it's called tech top-five dad is we got one more left head bring on 5th here we go dan what do you think about it and where'd you get this dan like so much I think it's kind of like my sister Clara's phone she's a huge owl that's pretty weird I think I don't like this one so scale one to ten this one doesn't have that much jazz I mean could you play Dan could you use your phone still I mean you use your stylus right what yeah it's like if you wanted to turn down the volume good luck with that wait we still 1 to 10 here we go final case oh I'm gonna give this one a nine this is a Niner this one is my favorite case and it's weird though it is weird has a little extra key fob coming with it you can use the buttons that's weird is functional it's soft you can pet it if you were Phil a little down where you don't actually a cattle yes there you go it's all well it's a one-stop shop Lincoln what do you think the tension between the father and the son I think it's a 5 because I've seen all right I'm giving this a 7 I like this case it's cool it definitely has the the type of customer that would pick this up I think Lincoln would be the perfect guy but my mom's not letting me get any pets could I travel so much so this is the new pet better neighbor in the comments we'll go with it so Daniel Lincoln it's time to pick the world's weirdest iPhone casing you guys vote up in the iCard right there which you think we got the purse case the Ferrari clone case the cat case the ziplock case and then the pop tart or slime you guys vote up there and I'm gonna start with you okay pick it I'm oddly enough I'm going with the very first one I'm going with mr. pop-tart I'm changing just because I'm so confused with the artwork on this van what is that slime that it's a simplest case of them all but to me it's I've got you different sprinkles or something or like a brown sugar cinnamon a blueberry yeah it's like a piece of Arts like a Monet like you could interpret this in many different ways Lincoln which is the weirdest iPhone case you've ever seen this one has the best story really do you like this smell you keep liking it is this smell something you'd ever wear okay so no one likes the Cologne let's just get that straight no one likes my Brutus iPhone case I'm gonna have to say is the first case is obnoxious it's my favorite from the video it has very pink so you guys that's it for this video if you guys liked it make sure to drop a like for episode 2 and check out dad and Lincoln's channel what's inside I'll link that down
