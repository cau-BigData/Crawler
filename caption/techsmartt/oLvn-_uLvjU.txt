there with you guys welcome back to tech smart and this product right in front of me is so sweet so have you ever wanted to wirelessly charge your air pots I'm sure you're probably saying absolutely yes right now and when I found this product if you guys want to check it out it goes for 30 bucks I'll link it down in the description this changed my life and for two reasons so wirelessly charging air pots it doesn't exist right now Apple said they're gonna make a case and drop it with the air power strip whenever that comes out I mean the iMac Pro we got lucky there so whenever the air power strip wants to come out sounds good thank you apples so in the meantime I couldn't wait you probably can't wait either this right here it's called the power pod and what it is is this silicone case and if you take a look right in the bottom you guys can see it right there it's a lightning too cheap hat basically a wireless charging pad I actually did this with my iPhone 8 challenge before it had wireless charging I put it on my iPhone so I'm gonna check it off here in the iCard this is so cool and what makes it even cooler I'm gonna show you the power pod case with a very special pair of air pods so I lost my last pair it falls right out of your pocket there's no friction with a silicone case like this it actually will keep your case in your pants I don't know about you but I need to keep it in my pants at all times so what this is is actually made by a company called color wear retro air pods so picture Apple in the 1970s maybe even the 1980s with the rainbow Apple logo making air pods so actually check something out like this it's right up there in the iCard ooh they made an iPhone 7 plus retro style which is metal like you can feel that's rich look at that one of the last ones they did I freaking loved it it was like $2,000 such a cool video and you guys crushed it on that one and Macintosh classic right back there so mad retro going on so this is actually hand-painted which is unbelievable there's these ridges on the side they're nice they add some texture so you can hold your air pod case and it won't just slip out of your hands but the bigger deal is check out these air pods it's really hard to see maybe on camera let me know in the comments right now if you guys can pick it up but it's the same color as the Mac classic back there made in 91 so that's incredible thanks so much color I've broken it up and what's dope is imagine the perfect setup I'm about to show you so for 30 bucks you can pull this off too so you basically take your existing air pod case you push it down gotta make sure it lines up no way I think I got it this is a power pod case with the retro air pods all inside so really nice tacky rubber on the side here way better than I was even thinking I saw the IndieGoGo and I wasn't like super into it but for 30 bucks you're not doing a DIY it works so I picked up what is the best wireless charger out on the market give you the judge you guys let me know in the comments if you like this this goes for 70 bucks and before you kill me like literally kill me check this out so it is a wireless charging pad on the top which is awesome and then underneath three USB ports a USB C port and then obviously the DC port so which suite is you can actually feed your cables through the back end here so everything looks super clean if you were to put it on like a nightstand or a table boom just like that and check this out when the light shows up you know things are wireless to charge it so up to this moment this is everything I've never really seen this done before and something that you can actually pick up here we go so in order to get things to wirelessly charge you need to put the ear pods facedown with the lightning bolt symbol on your pad and just like that when a light shows up on the Nomad that's how you know it's wirelessly charging and one thing that I really like about this retro finish is on the air pods they almost add more grip and texture so one thing I can't stand it's just how slippery and glossy the air pod cases but more some of the air pods so because of this like sandpaper finish it almost stays in your ear much better than like ever cease usually they would just both fall out it would be a one-two Mayweather so there it is things are wirelessly charging I don't know how long this will take I'll let you guys know on Twitter I'm just at tech smart basically from here you guys have seen the future before Apple could even make it they made it but you guys don't have it so that's it for this video I'm so gonna enjoy these definitely check out the PB GM's plus my playlist I update every single week link that down below and Spotify man these are so nice get subscribed if you're new just click that circle button down there and check out two other videos right over here I'll see you guys next time bass
