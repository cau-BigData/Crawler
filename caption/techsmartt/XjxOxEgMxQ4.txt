hey what's good guys welcome back to tech smart for a really interesting video that has a huge back story like always I gotta tell you guys what's up so there's been a few videos in the channel around vaping just like that with the caps you have a vape spitter [Music] I've done a few just to show you guys what crazy vape products exist you guys are missing those the right up there in the iCard from Ave puddi to a vape fidget spinner you guys have seen it all here on techsmartt and it's the second largest search term on tech smart like literally no joke if you guys type in techsmartt do it do it right after this video and then just see what pops up it's gonna be the second one on search so the lot of people want to see more vape videos and in this video we're not gonna be vaping but we're gonna be trying something out that I've wanted to know about perky months so it got me thinking since the Joule is so big this company's worth fifteen to twenty billion dollars it's a huge trend that just boomed and Joule has really been the sole proprietor behind it like no joke guys Joule has basically been it you've either heard of vaping you've heard of dueling it's even got its own word so what I actually picked up and this is no joke whoa there I actually had to come across 68 packs a jewel pod so what my theory is is how much volume I'll need to submerge a brand new iPhone 10 ours so just an iPhone 10 are you guys have seen a ton of videos where stress test this drop tested a scratch test it even taking a flamethrower to it you guys missed those videos they're linked down below right up there in the iCard you guys know the playlist and where it is but getting this many Joule pods was scary so what I did is actually hopped on ebay before these got banned you can no longer buy pods online unless it's through jewel that's the way it should have been if you ask me but I got them on eBay and as you guys can tell there was once listing so in total I spent $1,500 more times 68 272 pods alright here we go so you guys can tell I got eight and this one you'd see the flavors but the listings got pulled 219 like I can't believe this and the whole reason why these listings got pulled is what's going on in the u.s. right now so the FDA the Food Drug Administration which basically patrols anything that goes on in your body they said that they were gonna regulate vaping or at least introduce some policy this matters because this is where this story goes really crazy in a different direction well basically after they came back and said hey vape companies we're not gonna regulate you guys regulate yourselves what happened is Jules said we're no longer gonna sell the flavored pods so you can't really buy these in stores there's still a few shops selling them around but basically not only was this the last order on eBay lease for Joule pods from what I can see but everything in this box has basically doubled if not tripled in value at least from what I think I mean literally if I just weighed it on this it probably would go up so here we go with the video you guys get what's going on now basically what we're gonna do is open up every single pack you know I know it wouldn't be the holiday season as always if I didn't give something away while I destroy something and fifteen hundred dollars which could basically be like three thousand if I just save this in rationed it but instead I'm here to put science to the test and find out if Joule pods against an iPhone in really a bath if your iPhone XR will survive I mean the new 10 R is a durable beast you guys have seen that in the videos absolutely crushed all my expectations so I'm gonna give away an iPhone tennis max just so you guys are happy it's the holiday season I'm trying to give back so all you need to do is subscribe follow on Instagram just techsmartt everything will be linked down below and then like the photo of basically this video it's gonna be crazy so this will last a month it's open to anyone internationally and I'll get that all shipped out thank you guys again for the support and almost three 1 million fou and two hundred thousand on Instagram I don't keep track but I appreciate you guys thank you so much for making it happen and honestly letting me buy $1500 in Joule pods so iPhone 10 are here is basically what we're gonna put all the jeweled juice in and you're probably thinking Keaton what comes in a pack so this can see the barcode everything is all good if you open one of these up and keep in mind don't smoke it's not a good idea or vape just don't do it like not even the FDA could regulate this it's crazy it is so crazy what's going on right now so you have your jewel pod you guys can see this is the what flavor is this the fruit medley so to crack one of these open I was watching a video do this carefully and don't try this at home don't get near this stuff it's packaged for a reason but basically that is a little jewel pod just without the mouthpiece and then there's just like rubber gasket in there that if you remove you have the juice so let the juice drip on out how many of these do we have that 170 so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna speed this up for this video but if you want to see the raw uncut it'll be funny I'll leave a link down below it'll be on the second channel tech smart too that's gonna be a long beast clip but this is crazy and if you like the pods definitely check that out here we go I got a new plan now the easiest way to do this is basically just to get all the pods out of the PAX pods packs alliterations I'm just learning in this video I'm really learning always learning in these vape videos and if you guys are to make sure you just subscribed this isn't a vape channel this is for science we're trying to find out if your iPhone can actually survive a Joule attack you might not know where or when to expect it but it's coming let me know in the comments if you guys know anything about this or if you're smarter than me if it I think most you guys probably have a better clue the iPhone you guys think it's gonna stand a chance vote up in the iCard yes no it's a little too early to say boom have just like that we have pods for days pods for games dude well that's how we made the thumbnail so now it's time to basically take out every single pod from its second pack Bono's of it is stinging it is stinging today no joke there's so many jewel pods how do we do this to it once maybe two-handed but try to hands up oh there we go I almost took em out with that pod there that is a whole pots I think we've over killed it but that's techsmartt right last pack F are you ready free left to left one last and the final pod before we then get to open all of them I've been unleashed here we are my hands just feel tingly with them on it no I should really wear gloves now for part two I got to figure out a faster way to do these I'm gonna find the method we got F he's literally helping our now not only shooting the video but helping us on Jul the video so to do some quick math series like each jewel pod has point 7 milliliters we're gonna need a lot of jewel pods that's my biggest fear right now what if there's not enough cause and this cannot be healthy do not try this at home I'm able to take it off in one clipping we've we've had progress in this video we've learned something mom I'm so sorry for this video my mom's gonna just be so upset she don't like the saving definitely share this video both videos any video on this because this is crazy my fingers are tingling you pull that metal rod out just lausanne out and we should be able to pull out perfect this is gonna work I'm getting I'm getting excited we definitely have enough and we're only getting more trying to see how much depth we got here so we're cleaning out the tub of juice here whoa look at all that I don't know the flavors in the smells can't tell anymore [Applause] getting close I think we're getting close to full submersion so you got about 25 maybe 15 20 left sardick even no numbers it was 9 plus team thank you like that all the who I'm stuttering because well I think it's gone to my brain I don't think anyone's opened this many jewel pods consecutively in one sitting if that record has been set let me know Guiness it hasn't just techsmartt with two T's would be great this is suffering home stretch boys boom last final drops Ave oh that's every pod do you see any pods on the floor near you my man you do not boom dad is what we call the jewel pod bath imagine earthquake just came right now swallowed it up I would cry so here is our jewel juice it'll have to be enough to coat the iPhone I'm pretty sure the iPhone 10 R will it might survive so after about how long was it as four hours we've emptied as much of the jewel pods as we can here are how many jewel pods we've used here the caps pretty crazy rainbow color so here is the jewel juice from around 250 or so jewel pods you guys will let me know how many were use that's everything this is everything what we're gonna do is submerge the iPhone 10 are fully working by the way and the for an entire day let it sit overnight and we'll see what happens see if we have enough whoa whoa no way we might have we might just have enough it's too close to call we're close oh we're so close cool shot you can see the face ID look at that the face ID sensors going off make sure we get it all coated this is the best we could do this is gonna be one sticky iPhone car what's crazy is the minute the iPhone 10 are really sunk to the bottom it fully got submerged so that shows really how dense the liquid is like crazy that Jewel juice is that dense that just needed to be shifted around a little bit sink to the bottom and well ya know it's fully submerged check that out I said it to never die so we'll find out what kills it first the jewel juice or the iPhones battery one detail at the label alright so it has been basically an entire day with the iPhone 10 are fully submerged in jewel juice 250 or so pods so much money over 1,500 dollars spent basically to find out will your iPhone survive against a jewel attack just like brushes off trying to conserve much the juice can don't know why but don't let it drip all about that drip and not gonna lie I was pretty set that the chemical obviously nicotine would change the color of the aluminum or have some sort of reaction but what I'm coming to find out is not only is this juice so sticky but maybe just maybe your phone will survive a jewel attack and really any a juice attack you never know it could come when you least expect it gonna move our jewel juice let's just look at this iPhone 10 are any discoloration does it even turn on that's what I'm wool it's saying all it needs is a battery to charge it up we're gonna give it just that will it be resurrected everybody let's see if we can go ahead and bring this guy back to life I'll be honest the jewel juice just makes everything you're saying it I'm seeing it the iPhone 10 are is charging so we're gonna sit here and wait and see if it did me damage I am continuously blown away by the iPhone 10 are from drop tests to flamethrowers to scratch test this thing is a beast and now it survived this stickiest test of all time there we have it you guys saw it power on Wow even connected a Wi-Fi can I load something like YouTube maybe what should just redirect you to the jewel site let's take a picture no not even gonna touch my face it looks like the 10r isn't affected Wow there you have it the iPhone 10 R is the most durable device I have ever seen Apple make it survived a jewel bath so that's it for this video this one took around 5 hours literally just to make and open up all the jewel pods and now I got a headache again so that's gonna do it for this video if you guys liked it make sure to drop a like and get subscribed but hitting that button if you're new make sure you follow me on Instagram just techsmartt and check out two other videos right after this I'll see you guys next time buh-bye
