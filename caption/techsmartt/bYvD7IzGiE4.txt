so you guys know there are a bunch of smartphones coming out I know Kyle does Kyle's a new guy around here he's on camera there are a bunch of smartphones coming out and oftentimes you're gonna find a smartphone that is killer and at a pretty cheap price with the iPhone 10 costing $1,000 chill out this isn't the real one here a lot of videos are coming up on that soon you guys have probably already seen a bunch it's kind of a deal breaker thousand bucks for a phone that's alright these phones here not only have you haven't heard of them but they have some pretty sweet stuff so if you guys want to check out any of the phones mentioned I'll leave a link down below we got the me zu pro 7 the boom EDG s2 this is my favorite out of the bunch and I haven't even checked him out yet and then these Xiaomi me mix - you guys have probably seen them and let's do it we got the Xiaomi me mix - I saw the me mix one or the me Mix og whatever it's called and I really wanted to check it out now that I got the me mix - here we're chilling let's open this up this goes for 550 bucks vote up in the iCard which phone you guys think is the most worth it I'll let you know at the end of the video all right standard accessories do we get any freebies or a case sometimes with these phones you'll get like a free via case a screen protector Oh Mike we wait a minute wait a minute I was distracted Kyle stop distracting me we get a free case that's nice that's nice you don't get this Apple doesn't Wine and Dine you like this whoa this phone is feeling good right off the bat it's a fingerprint magnet I think it's glass in the back I know there's a pro version of this and I'm pretty sure it's made out of ceramic it's like some limited edition stuff this thing's got four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of storage and a bezel list screen that's the cool thing about all these phones the screen on them bezel lists nothing fat like your iPhone eight here with these thick bars no desolace so let's check this out power down now got the speakers at the bottom USB see that's good at least we're all going to that none of this microUSB stuff get it out of here we got to make some changes one port the phone's all powered on now whoa it feels amazing having a six-inch bezel this display like the only real bezel on here's at the bottom it fills the entire screen like I like this and what's interesting is this year on the me mix we have an actual speaker port right up there whereas last year eight which vibrate through the display kind of interesting I like it I'm messing with it this looks great like this really looks great and what's crazy is I don't know if you can see this too well but the front-facing camera is actually at the bottom cuz like they don't have enough room to put it at the top so we're gonna try out the camera right now the back facing camera it looks pretty good got a picture of my main man Rob back there the front this is where it gets interesting you have to be careful about not having like your hand cover it up accidentally it's one of those things that like you'll actually probably end up doing the cameras right in there like my palm kind of gets in the way a little bit oh no way on the front it's it's guessing my age can you see that age 27 22 well how old do you think I'm looking and like the way I tilt my face it's guessing my age just based on like my facial expressions I saw a 19 to 22 I'm feeling pretty young and groovy let's try to take a picture oh it's you see like when I go to at least put my thumb on like the shutter button like reaches across and covers covers the camera alright I don't want to cover the camera up okay I guess we're gonna be taking photos with our left hand now it's like I'm looking at the top expecting it to be like eye level but I need to look down that's kind of weird boat up in the iCard along the way which phone you guys think is the most worth it this phone is definitely interesting in the finger but reader on the back check this out this is lightning fast ready I just rest my finger down and boom I'm in that's faster than touch ID and I know I said earlier this phone's got four gigs ram it's got six actually and four 550 bucks like this phone feels powerful this thinks the badass next up is the mesial pro 7 this thing goes for three hundred and fifty dollars and what's cool about it is it has a six-inch screen just like the me mix run Android seven and what gets even crazier is there's some bonus on the back so let's open it up let's see how this fares okay so on the front it's like your standard rug do we get any goodies I always have to look I feel like we're gonna get something they hook it up these Chinese companies they hook it up get a case okay so sad wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I almost wrote it off no no no of course we get a case woah that looks crazy and as you guys can tell there's like this weird cutout on the back because there's actually a second display right underneath the rear camera what is this in here a VIP card okay I think that's like their warranty card honestly guys like these phones they just showed up I thought all of you would be bezu lists it's taking me like a moment to realize this phone isn't bezel as' this is pretty much like my iPhone 8 plus here it's you got some pretty thick bezels at the top also this is a 5.2 inch screen so just keep that in mind okay let's just jump on into it we've got USB see at the bottom oh I almost forgot a headphone jack this phone's looking pretty sweet alright let me turn this thing on it's looking good it feels good it's made out of metal on the back it's got a nice feel doesn't feel too cheap we're gonna home-button that's a luxury in 2017 looking at you iPhone 10 I'm just learning this now the rear display not only shows the time think you might have caught that but it actually shows the camera if you find her it's right back here you can get it you can actually see what you want to take and then you just take it with the volume buttons that's groovy and it looks really good too that's like a high quality display there yo I like that I want to try out the fingerprint reader on here I think it's gonna be good alright that was not bad was it as fast as fast as the me mix if you want the best finger of a reader the me makes two is gonna be your go-to here and I know that we haven't even seen a third phone this phone is pretty much like the old iPhone 6 got your headphone jack USB see even better thick bezels they got it let me customize the screen on the secondary display notification management that's sweet I won't be seeing when my girls calling oh that's that's clutch Rob you don't want I mean when your girls call and dude like you don't want to you don't want to know half the time dude you don't need that noise that is what you're learning so you just double tap to wake it that is sweet pedometer shows you this foods got everything I don't know how accurate that is in fairness that's awesome we take a picture on the rear camera some reason I'm not messing with the watermark down here taking with the dual camera what is that this phone 350 bucks alright the last one that just came in this has got me hyped this is the luma DG s - this thing goes for 200 bucks and what's really cool is 6-inch display low res but 200 bucks and like the world's fattest battery 5100 milliamp hours this thing will last you two days no problems link to the world I feel in touch with the world right now I'm feeling good what even better there's a case put on there I love the freebies charger this is a nice box set up Apple take some notes we've got a chicken we get the included 3.5 to USB adapter always nice oh wow now we're chilling so this is kind of one of the semi basalis displays it's a six inch phone and like the me mix it Accu PI's most of the screen like I'm comfortable with these kinds of bezels the Mizzou Pro is just like the me zu that's how we're saying the me zu pro it's it's got the thickest out of them here alright this is kind of wacky now that the s2 is on it has a six inch display it's not 1080p and the only reason I mentioned this is because it matters when it's like a lower res display it's a 720p one and normally like I wouldn't say anything but you can definitely tell if you look just a little closer at your phone also this being so large it's it's weird it's got an 18 by 9 aspect ratio so it's really long and that's kind of how the iPhone X is doing it to your iPhone 10 since it's got a 5 point 8 inch display it's gonna feel like you're using a 4.7 inch I liked pretty much an iPhone 6 iPhone 7 or the iPhone 8 weird alright I like it let's check out the camera oh yo dad front-facing camera no good no good let's check out the back one Rob what you thinking it's imposing than there meant we're shooting in the light so it's like it's alright it's capturing detail the best I can I mean this is the cheapest phone on the list 200 bucks check out that fingerprint reader all right fingerprints pretty slow the mimics judo is the fastest out of all these then I'd say the Museo and then yes - okay so all these phones are pretty interesting we got the s2 and the pro seven bolt made out of metal whereas the Phoenix has like more of a glass feel this is a more powerful one obviously because it costs more money it's it's it's no competition at that point the best one to get though in my opinion has gotta be the s2 200 bucks 6-inch display which crazy is the battery on this thing is gonna last you two days two days of heavy usage if you guys need a phone a secondary phone someone to give a phone to get them this they're gonna like it so yeah guys that's Perdition for this video make sure you get subscribed and you turn those notifications on let me know in the comments which phone you guys thought was the most worth it and I'll see you guys later peace [Music]
