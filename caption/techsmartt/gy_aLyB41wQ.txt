so we just came up with this idea we're here at chase right now taking care of some business and I haven't seen anyone go out and buy a physical Bitcoin I know there's these Bitcoin ATMs that exists but since bitcoins like what seventeen thousand dollars at the time we're filming this video on a Monday I want to actually go pick one up I've never actually like owned a full Bitcoin and sent to $17,000 what I'm imagining in my head is a Craigslist kind of deal I show up with 17 grand I get a Bitcoin I know it's not physical it's like a digital currency and I'm off on my way there's a lot of like other things I haven't thought about in terms of how we're gonna get the money how we're gonna get the coin how we're not gonna get killed and ultimately how we're not gonna lose money on the Bitcoin like it's going up and down who is at 13 grand yesterday today it's at 17 tomorrow it could be a hundred let's go get some money so right now I'm on this app called coin base this is where you can buy and sell bitcoins online so you don't have to do what we're about to do the current price of the bitcoin is going for seventeen thousand dollars and this is just on the coin based app I'm gonna put up my coin base referral if you guys I think buy $100 with a Bitcoin I get like a little referral of $10 I'll let you know in the description below you guys want to check it out I'll put my Bitcoin address up here too if any of you guys know the Winklevoss twins I actually created Facebook now I'm just playing what we're about to do is head over to the chase booths right over there and pull out $20,000 in cash the way this goes down is I'm imagining someone's gonna want $17,000 for the Bitcoin that's what the price is going for now and then probably want a little more than market value I guess that's how buying and selling works I'm hoping they'll just take it at street value and we can just get this for 17 grand it's not looking likely once we go over then get that cash the hunt begins to find the coin junior 20s hundreds okay we're gonna I swear had the chase window right now low-key pretty scared I've been a minute since we pulled out this much cash last time it was to buy 30 iPhones at you guys this time whirly buying one Bitcoin I wish I did this with Bitcoin was a thousand dollars so it's Tuesday we still got the cash from Chase we haven't been robbed yet the current price of one Bitcoin is seventeen thousand seven hundred and ninety seven dollars so I think it's gone up since last night you can see the chart it's just kind of going all up and down across the board I mean this thing could be at 20 grand by the time we actually buy one so what we're gonna do now is call some people on Craigslist that are selling some bitcoins hopefully this isn't as sketchy as it sounds it really sounds bad there's to be a site called local bitcoins where you could meet up with people and kind of facilitate transactions that way it's since then doesn't seem to be a thing in California so we are using Craigslist we got a few numbers let's give them a call so we're calling the first number see if they pick up hi I saw your listing on Craigslist regarding selling a Bitcoin how many do you have all right well thank you so much for your time I appreciate a man all right let's try out another number I guess the hunt continues hey I saw your listing on Craigslist about selling some Bitcoin you mean you're gonna sell me no I want to buy Bitcoin from you you're selling to me alright well thanks thanks so much alright this is so hard this is so hard hi I saw your listing on Craigslist about selling Bitcoin and I'm just serious alright would you be willing to meet up at a police station for security purposes we can get them in on it too like what's your name what's your name by chance nice to meet clean doctor well that's the issue so coinbase doesn't have enough supply for Bitcoin right now and we have cash that's kind of our catch-22 right now and with coinbase you have some limits and we're not able to purchase an entire Bitcoin with our account status so that's that's why I'm coming to the Bitcoin doctor market price will say is 18 grand right now plus 10% 1800s so and just doing some quick math you eighteen thousand eight hundred dollars or whatever the market rate is a Bitcoin I'll give you a call back at around fifteen minutes all right thank you all right bye we got a hit the bitcoin doctor seems like he's coming through I'm kind of excited I don't feel as sketched out as I was going into all these calls he seems like he's willing to meet up at a police station ten percent I mean should we have tried to negotiate that there's a little too late whoa whoa wait 15 min eaten a - playing hardball and gonna make me wait til the last ring aren't you or straight-up ghost I might give it one more ring hi so we made some calls and here's what I'm willing to propose I'm willing to buy one Bitcoin at market value so let's just say $18,000 and I'm will pay a 5% fee we can fix that at $900 and we can come drive to you for convenience sake if you want to just text us an address of a police station but like that's that's currently the best we can do yeah okay what would you counter at in terms of a percent so I I did some digging there's a few other sellers on Craigslist I was looking at a few Bitcoin ATMs locally around here we do want to buy one coin so I'm just trying to see what the best way the best way we can make this work is very very strong holders and no I totally understand I will go ahead and let you know tomorrow if we're still interested if not it was great speaking with you Bitcoin doctor that literally sounded like a robot if this is what artificial intelligence is gonna be in a year I'm scared do you guys take Bitcoin one day one day while we try to find some Bitcoin ATMs I want to announce a quick Bitcoin giveaway so this use been amazing thank you guys so much for all the support so I'm

will be lasting for 96 hours and I'll announce the winners on Instagram Twitter and let you guys know in the YouTube comments - let's hope some Bitcoin ATMs don't scare us so while we're waiting for the doctor to lower his prices I went online and I found that there's a local Bitcoin ATM I'm sure you guys have heard about this they kind of have high fees but that this random liquor store so let's come on let's go on some coins and a good name do the name and so they even have like coin on here I got my wallet right here so here's my address if you guys want to send me any Bitcoin that'd be bomb seriously hook it up someone someone's gotta have like one Bitcoin they want a sauce your boy so we're gonna scan this on the machine you see the wallet address is recognized so insert a cash so far is zero which equals zero mega BTC one mini BTC right right man I'm be teasing ya 1m BTC is going for twenty four dollars and ten cents so one Bitcoin from this machine if we picked it up would be twenty four thousand one hundred dollars the current price of Bitcoin on coin base right now is going for seventeen thousand eight hundred and fifty four dollars they're making a lot of bread that's the wallet I'm using it's good pun there they're making a lot of bread just off this machine let's just try it out I want to see what it's about I'm gonna put I'm gonna put a little cash in here I'm gonna give it 40 bucks just want to see how this goes down you guys want to try out your own Bitcoin ATM this is kind of what the process looks like the 20 bucks in and it calculates how much em BTC that's a pretty hefty fee that is a pretty hefty fee alright so we're just gonna hit five bitcoins and just like that well that was really easy and we just bought $40 for the coins so basically when you buy Bitcoin from a machine they're pretty much charging double I put $40 in and the value I got was $20 I've literally just lost $20 because I put it in an ATM what's interesting is though they have a few alt coins so they got BCH and they have light coin they're charging 472 dollars for the light coin but the current price of light coin is going for 350 bucks not a bad way to go basically what went down in there is the guy that's running the store pretty much just watch me waste twenty dollars into a machine it just ate it right up Bitcoin ATMs are cool we're gonna go check out a few others see if we get some better fees or else we're gonna be calling up the doctor Letta move I thought that we just showed up to another liquor store this one also has a Bitcoin ATM but it's looking a little more promising and we can probably maybe avoid the doctor I don't want to pay that 10% so it looks like this ATM wants to charge us eighteen thousand two hundred and sixty-three bucks at least that's what they're marking it up the current price of Bitcoin is seventeen thousand five hundred and sixty six bucks a start and see what's good I'd love to avoid the doctor at this point I want to avoid the doctor okay so there actually is a limit on this we can only spend ten grand once the ID is verified I don't like overspend ten grand let's just see what 40 bucks look at us buy bitcoins do you have a Bitcoin wallet of course I do take a picture of me looks good same Bitcoin wallet please send me some money would be great I'm gonna need it after all these fees so 50 bucks we get point zero zero two seven three six one nine Bitcoin bitcoins already been receiving my wallet print receipt still feel like we got scammed we got $20 $20 after putting 50 in the machine we need to call up the doctor I'm sorry to feel pretty awful about these Bitcoin ATMs I mean I know they got to make some money but I put in $50 more than the last machine and I got less money than with the last machine gave me bets legit let's hope this guy's not a doctor what if he's like Nernst Bitcoin hey how are you calling about the Bitcoin so we're just looking to get one Bitcoin right now we have cash with us so I mean what are you looking for on top of it I guess that's just a better question so we can cut to the chase so the reason why we can't buy their coin based is we have a fifteen thousand dollar limit and we want to get one whole Bitcoin it's just for a project we're working on that's kind of why we're we're doing the Craigslist yeah that'd be perfect we have cash but to make both of us feel a little more secure since I mean it's kind of like a higher transaction could we meet at a police station inside I know I know it sounds a little different but you know I just want to make sure we both feel comfortable because this is a lot of cash here and this is a Bitcoin just to be totally honest here like I don't know how secure a bank lobbies is and I mean a banks are pretty much closed after 6:00 normally I would say Starbucks but we're dealing with we're dealing with like a high-profile currency so all right yeah is there any way you could do it tonight or would you want to do it in the morning all right we'll let you know that all right all right thanks man all right so pretty much he wants to do it at like a Starbucks no one's really down to do ahead of police station but I'm not gonna lie like this will not be happening at a Starbucks we're at the Wells Fargo Bank about to buy one Bitcoin hopefully not get stabbed or robbed I'd rather get robbed and stabbed I think but at this price like maybe a stabbings all right all right so I think this is the guy Bitcoin hey how you doing thought I was gonna get stabbed we're already coming out on top you got a form here that is basically a bill of sale I got this bill of sale will transfer legally my Bitcoin to you but obviously since this is like what $16,500 your story I mean what surprised 16500 17 okay so so you guys made out better fine this morning the last night I guess a thousand dollars and this is the juicy part oh and you have the cash yeah oh yeah of course I'll just run it through that's all bank basically we'll go here BTC wallet send one Bitcoin send and then you can just press that and you can scan it for yourself there we go buying one Bitcoin and if you'd like to put notes or something like that Thanks sound okay there you go we go you just got a Bitcoin let's walk let's walk he was so chill we didn't even get charged a five percent but you know living literally I mean we got a Bitcoin for cash value that's customer service you can't be baby so it's exactly nine hours later the Bitcoin finally cleared in the wallet so as you guys can see we didn't get a full Bitcoin and that's because the miners they take a fee that's just how Bitcoin and blockchain works so in our wallet right now this is just because of some of the other transactions we did with ATMs we technically have a full Bitcoin or a thousand millimeter see that makes sense you guys you guys know exactly what's going on here so this is what you have to do if you want to go ahead and buy a Bitcoin locally you go ahead and use coinbase but what's kind of interesting is with this being a decentralized currency there are so many hurdles to jump over just to like get a full Bitcoin if you want to get a smaller amount it's a little easier but to get one full Bitcoin this is what you have to go through so I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys hit the link in the
