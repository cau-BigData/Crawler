projectors how about a chair let's find a nice comfy gaming chair just so long John I mean home theater setup use these for a couch I gotta look for the couch on wish yeah we're buying a couch from which alright let's not blow the budget here is that a blow-up Oh if this couch okay it's an inflatable queen couch please don't show the picture let me say don't show the picture let me show the picture alright I'm buying the couch that was simple you want popcorn like popper flop chick on that episode up there josh has been killing it all right let's do popcorn actually do you trust it from wish like you're basically ordering food from wish wait dude if this is a footnote this is a mini popcorn maker actually I kind of want that 24 bucks in red only eight left not a single review what what is that dude Josh what what the heck all right let's just grab this popcorn maker do they sell movies on wish can they do that I love it dude they got the Fast and the Furious 7 movie collection for $11 they have 7 movies for $11 what are the reviews best movie ever r.i.p paul walker like how can they offer that for $11 is that legal I am so happy with my order it came two weeks early alright I'm done we're getting a fast seven movie set josh Josh Josh it's free hey I'll get that yeah I'm dead goodness it's for a dog I don't care and of course we're gonna need a DVD player let's just get one for 15 bucks and I'm probably gonna yep I'm getting it cheaper because I bought it with myself buy with Luke actually I am mistaken I need to find an HDMI to USB converter this is awesome is lighting the HDMI so you got USB female USB which is how we're gonna adapt the u.s. we the DVD drives you know what I'm saying here girl and then it plugs in with HDMI and the last thing that is crucial for any movie night is a movie blanket alright we're gonna get a cheap twelve dollar blanket actually that's not cheap and we're gonna get it in ivory no I'm not feeling ivory I'm thinking like a nice burgundy calm Iran so we got 13 items in the cart let's review we got a blanket we got an HDMI to female USB DVD player we got a water bottle for a dog but that's me dog we got seven movies for $13 I don't think that's real we'll find out a popcorn maker a couch a sound bar another projector a screen an HDMI cord that sets it's 3d and can save your life a splitter for your HDMI another projector just in case wish messes up and a 300,000 milliamp power battery pack whoa so how much is all of this 363 bucks for what I think is the ultimate home set up I'm gonna hit order hopefully it shows up so this one actually took around a month for everything to show up this is one of the projectors that we bought this is such a little projector what is this an iPhone oh no III was not even joking there is no freaking way this can power a full movie theater set up yeah this is kind of scary so it takes microSD cards and then projects can you plug it in no HDMI on here fast seven seven movie collection yes I don't even know how much you spent $5.00 on this I don't know you guys let me know in the comments we can't even open the thing for ride the horse doesn't even open you got to pay an extra six you got seven movies what is this Fast and the Furious Fast and the Furious 2 too fast and too furious Tokyo Drift that handsome figure is four we got Fast Five now Fast & Furious 6 take a guess with the seventh on this called Furious 7 not fast ok this is a real projector that one had to be a mini one if the reason I bought two didn't even think I would have to use the second and Wow it even has it an SD card slot so you can put your own stuff in there a V and that aux port USB that's not something the other one had power port headphones VGA and HDMI and there's the infrared because it also comes with a remote this is why we buy two you call me crazy you think I'm overspending I'm not over spending anything what's in this box the DVD player it comes with a firewire cable you plug that in that's your USB that goes to the projector feeling good feeling a lot better this is important the popcorn maker everyone's got a movie theater you need popcorn it's like one plus one equals three yes we got popcorn that's it it comes in the bowl you know it might actually need to come with a repairman because I think I might have broke it I got scared I didn't see the the AC cord I thought this editing had battery powered a battery powered popcorn maker there's a freebie idea for you what is no way we got two of them oh no no this is the blanket best thing yet I even wanted to spend extra bread to get a really nice blanket we're gonna be chilling soon it's like one of those super soft blankets you find at Costco we got our couch now the craziest thing we have ever bought on wish and also probably the most real and relatable it's a couch it's not a gas-powered scooter if you missed that video we're gonna go outside we're gonna gas this thing up try it out hopefully we can ride it on the street and not die we got a sound bar and I'm so happy I got two because chances are I don't think one's gonna work you know what this actually looks like it's about a word I'm pretty surprised this is way better built than the picture showed variable dial switch change them oh oh you even have battery recharge it there you have an aux port fast-forward play rewind and then it charge it microUSB could be the best thing in the video could be votive in the iCard which item you think is gonna be the best and which is really gonna make the setup USB to HDMI I think we're maybe gonna need this do you even have a USB port we're covered there is a USB port so theoretically we can make this totally work with the nice projector that I got last thing here to make this setup perfect where we gonna cast this I didn't get a railing so josh has been really crushing it at the gym good man he's gonna hold the movie screen we got six movies to watch so now I'm gonna pop the lights on the whole techsmartt team is gonna help me assemble this movie theater because for 363 bucks if we pull this off and we can even watch a movie and be comfortable and cozy and fed with the popcorn that's a win it's day two of this project here's the deal blanket is working perfectly it did not break this is the best buy from the entire video tech company wish when you no blankets the best thing they sell that should tell you something the couch we're actually going to move like this I hit the young Walmart this morning [Music] and just like that on the HDTV Channel get maitika all right would I sleep on here for one night maybe two alright so the next thing that we got is the popcorn maker I'm so stoked about this I was really excited they didn't include popcorn I don't know if I would trust popcorn that was shipped just not really my cup of tea or cup of popcorn really give her a little sprinkle spackle a healthy after-school snack a little bit of this is bacon time that is the most anticlimactic this is just awful popcorn is still cooking so with the soundbar got it in a really nice gold color I didn't expect it to look this good this could be the best buy out of the entire video this is like really good it's a good sound bar so I wanna see if it works and if it sounds good it's only got two jobs look good sound good let's play this so I'm playing it from the PB GM's playlist it's the Spotify playlist update every single week gonna check it out link in the description how much should we pay for this this is really good yo you're like a college dorm room or anything where you want to just kind of amplify the sound get this position it nicely in your room I think I got two four six years something like that looks not bad either that's so hot that is so hot oh it looks disconnected so it does not have an electrical curve and there is a fire I I was not joking I was not joking we have a fire alright I'm a little scared his popcorn bowl is extremely hot so I'm gonna put it on the couch it pops it you saw it here okay so this is basically our movie setup we got the screen couch Josh can you hook it up with the blanket man I'm a little cold right now we have a screen a couch a blanket some popcorn a speaker that works and the last thing is the projector and DVD player so let's plug this in see what happens that doesn't smell the bus no didn't turn it on I wanted to turn on Josh you'll know if it turns on I'll freak out I can tell you 100% this thing smells burnt probably a second fire we caused but didn't see first one we saw the whole point of this was to try to build a movie theater using wish only tech projectors fried but since this isn't power on this doesn't work and because that doesn't work I got a second projector I selected the EU plug I don't have one that's small enough this is a 12 volt not a 24 volt we we're done there's just no movie that's happening I didn't even get to watch seven seven beetle movies honestly it's okay I prefer the books anyway but if the Netflix and chill by myself so that's it for this video if you guys really enjoyed it and want us to do another sort of theme drop a
