with you guys keeping here and I'm back at it again for another video I don't know where I would have gone basically it's about to go down so if you have no idea what I'm talking about the hype is real oh I've never been properly - I made this video a few months back on $125 fake iPhone 10 and I compared it to the real deal you can definitely tell the UH the fake ones white whereas like the real one is silver you guys want to check that video out it's right up there in the iCard you guys crushed it the video blew up thank you so much so basically how this goes down is I have two Galaxy S nine pluses in front of me this phone's not even out yet and I picked this one up I'll leave a link down below for around 90 bucks and stretch it from like ninety bucks it's like 260 bucks so I'll leave the most cheapest pricing in the description if you want to pick one of these up you're gonna have to tell me fold up in the iCard real quick which one you guys think is real what you think is fake big things of Squarespace by the way for actually sponsoring this video link down below if you guys want a site it's super easy I'll tell you more at the end she go to Squarespace comm slash tech smart so vote up in the iCard which phone you think is real which phone you think is fake number one or number two one two you're about to find out I want to know one day like do an intervention like go to how many people's lives I saved by making these videos they knew they knew when they showed up that Craigslist they weren't getting scared one day alright sweet so here we go double leg as usual if you guys want me to keep this going with the latest devices so I'll tell you guys which one is real and which one is fake this one is fake this one's real well I mean obviously this one's real like what other one would it be this one's real guy this is the fake one this is a real one I want to just take a moment just so you guys can appreciate how much detail has gone into a phone that has not even come out yet I got this like three weeks ago my boy Aaron mister who's the boss hooked it up fatty style look at this just look at the detail typically the SI packaging was very similar to this so I thought this was gonna be the box they surprised this is sheer big thanks to Verizon for actually hooking it up with the s9 would've been able to do it without them so thank you let's look at the back real quick so full specs are on this box here this is some carrier info that'll vary from country to country or if you get just a sip I mean I'm really excited here so let's open the box on the fake one first just so you guys see what we get so you've lift it up check the sides real quick you should see some like UPC coding just basic barcodes you're not seeing that could be a fake just saying comment down below how many differences there are that I point out between these phones and that you might see whoever gets it right I'll pin your comment so when you open this up it says Samsung right there and I've already opened up this fake phone just letting you guys know haven't compared it to the real deal yet so this is it fingerprint reader is at the bottom it's like they knew it was coming out I think we all knew because of the leaked showed you guys on Twitter in case you can't see it what else we get some headphones while they really got the branding down to a science so that is the fake phone now what I've really been waiting for it I'm pretty sure what you've been waiting for what's in the real deal so to open this hole I got surprised I got surprised I didn't think it was a slide off box I don't know how else I'd get it off that's tight nice tight Samsung like the other one that this phone is hot this phone is so hot look at that s9 + baby and black that's a mid phone I'm pumped to check that out what else do we get in here EKG earbuds so you would be able to tell they're USBC cable nice little wall brick what would be nice Samsung cuz I know you're watching if you would just make that USB see so it's a CDC tip you like that this is my first time like powered on man there are a lot of similarities but immediately I see a few differences alright let's go and power these guys on okay this is secured by Knox powered by Android check the fonts then you see that like Samsung kind of like comma key font if you have a carrier at Verizon here oh yeah cool a time man yeah perfect so here are the phones so immediately you can tell the difference they should have a 6.2 inch screen this does this is some phat bezels just those black bars around the phone that's one huge dead giveaway just look for that if you see fat Chin's get out of here we don't want that around here it's not on the phones you want so you can see it's a little bit thinner antenna bands are a little different look at the speaker cutout it almost looks like a port alright so looking at the back we got fingerprint reader right below the cameras that looks like it has a true flash that one looks like it's lacking a little bit same slot is on the right so we're good there then we have our fix be buggered Bixby's county cool haven't really checked him out yet I'm more into like Siri you know Alexa so now that we've become friends with the phones let's jump into them see what makes them similar what see what makes me different we're gonna get to the bottom of it like nothing can fool me I am a pro at finding the differences so we'll swipe down well I mean that's a difference we could be settings a lot more options with the real one on the right side here just keep that in mind for the video let's check out camera this is where you find out and dude it galaxy s 9s second camera with that 1.5 aperture I'm excited to test it out in low-light make sure you keep it locked on the Instagram I'll post some pictures over there oh that looks so clean alright let's go for the selfie alright so just look at the menus real quick you can tell which ones real and which ones fake you have a lot more options on the real one selfie focus selfie AR emoji y itself you a lot options this camera this is just not safe click off if you guys can't handle this I think I'm in love with myself things have been a little more Wow that is that's some clean photos alright look no this looks I look way too zoomed it still good though but not not empty alright cool let's try out the rear camera I'll do all my this fall well we've lost a lot of the detail on the rear camera yeah I think we all know here just take a picture if you're on Craigslist or whatever you'll see real quick another thing that's really big on the galaxy s 9 this year he's intelligent skin so let's check it out on the fake see if it's there see what it's called at least this phone came out before the real one so I know ads just as curious as I am here the securities scroll down not really seeing anything screen lock then we have IRA cell lock that's pretty much it let's check it out on the real one city's lockscreen and security iris scanner face recognition intelligence games so that's a no let's see what iris unlocks about guessing it's something with your highs probably is so on the fake one it prompts me just place my two eyes near the phone alright and with intelligence can smarter way to verify hold your phone eight to ten inches away from your face I look so good on this camera closer to the face of course for ten to fourteen inches the ways we know more face time oh now you want my eyes get that sensor oh alright I think I think yep I failed I receives registered turn on so basically what I lock these phones fake one look at it swipe up it grabs my eyes forehead real last night I just look at it nothing nothing prompts try that again want to see this Wow I don't want to say it's a face ID killer it's definitely competitor though so big thing in the s9 is the screen you want your screen to look good and when you're doing a Craigslist deal it's pretty easy to tell if a phone is real or if it's not just by looking at it like it's not super hard common sense definitely comes into play so I'm a real s9 you can just tell the differences immediately between the fake the real the brightness these are at full brightness and a big thing on the s9 plus is the screen just look at how beautiful it is 6.2 inches quad Super AMOLED I wish it was a LED that would be the moves but let's just watch a video let's compare it we're gonna watch some ads doesn't look bad on the s9 fake I gotta be honest the colors definitely showed detail really shows in the s9 plus the real one that's to be expected I mean this is like ninety bucks Wow I am shocked I didn't think it was gonna look this good definitely 1080p I don't know who makes it out wow I'm getting pumped imagine dragons are pumping me up I'm excited like I want to keep going I want to show you more about these phones and of course there's gotta be at least some gimmick Apple drops face emoji with the iPhone 10 so what a samsung come up with a are emoji I don't know if it's a game again I want to try it out I'm not one of those people to write something off before trying it we'll see what's on the sn+ no way they knew about this going in here doing any modes setting that is no that is a note of the modes alright on the wheel s9 + got all these modes here it reminds me so much of the iPhone but they should put it at the top because why not so let's see what this is about create my emoji what am I about to go into okay I see just myself remove glasses alright let me just go on that have about to make an emoji what if I selected female like how would I turn out they're basically making a human as we speak yet yeah yeah you know alright guys so I'm with my boy JD and F right now real talk do we think it looks like no shot JD says F F alright thanks bud make my face a little bit more pale now we're getting some color how what no hard pass on that one yeah invert my eyes sounds good alright err emojis kind of cool save emojis Oh I mean it's cooler than just emojis talking well done Samsung and dude this camera trout the back camera guy it just looks fire all right you heard it here first the s9 plus is a definite win when it showed up for these Craigslist deals here's three things got to keep in mind check the displays see if there's fat Chin's we don't want that chins flip it over the back make sure there is a fingerprint reader under the camera if there's a lot of SAT fakes floating around still and then hop into the actual phone you don't turn it on it'll be like five minutes no big deal and go on a camera and tell me what you see take a picture but if you guys actually do this and encounter anything sketchy let me know on Twitter I'm just I'm smart I would love to hear about it it happens funny story so I had a guy last week I was trying to pick up a 30 inch cinema display like one of the old Apple ones for 250 bucks here in LA so came in at 225 he said that was fine but didn't recognize my phone number cuz I'm out of state I'm from Chicago originally so basically he's like send me a selfie so I sent him a selfie which is like really strange to do in a Craigslist transaction and he's like bro I'm still sketched out I was like I have the money set him a picture of the cash my face I was like I'm driving to the location was an hour way I was like thirty minutes into the drive and Midway I'm like you know I'll text you off my like la number nobody like that makes you feel better he's like whoa bro I use an LA number for sketchy stuff too I basically said his
