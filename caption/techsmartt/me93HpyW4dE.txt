so whenever Apple drops a brand-new iPhone design like the iPhone 10 hear the case game changes dramatically your iPhone 7 cases that do work with the iPhone 8 they don't work with the iPhone 10 I mean just look at this thing like it's the captain now look at me sure I'm the captain now so it kind of got me thinking like what battery cases are out there for the iPhone 10 Apple hasn't come out with their official battery case yet which I am looking forward to hook your boy up early that would be great Apple love you and Kofi hasn't really come out with anything yet and they usually come out with something so I'm in desperate need for one so what I did is I went on Amazon it picked up three different battery cases in one has a secret feature I have never seen before it's wireless charging so we're gonna find out which is the best for your money hey guys I am a huge fan of battery cases I always pick up the Mophie ones I always pick up the Apple ones sometimes they even pick up multiples just because they're really helpful if you go to Coachella bro you got a good job we're good job and you need extra battery life so these are your best options on Amazon right now I'll leave them linked down below if you want to check them out each come in at a different price point so you can kind of find the best option for you first one that we're gonna check out these the 3200 milliamp hour battery case this thing goes for like 20 bucks or something like that and what's cool about this is this is the most basic but it doesn't really lack it's good so what's great is your iPhone 10 has a battery size of 2,700 milliamp hours so this is gonna get you around a charge in almost a half you can really use that happier ever in an emergency it's great news so let's open this thing up I mean it's it's kind of love it like I'm loving it over here it's super simple you have your battery cases in black has kind this nice matte finish basically though since I just mentioned McDonald's if you get the fries and you touch this case know from an expert here you're gonna get grease on the case it's just gonna happen you get your camera cut out you have your battery indicator at the bottom so when you hold down that button right there you can see all four LEDs pop up at the bottom this is where some of these cases either make it or they break it and it seems like they're getting with the times at the bottom right here isn't a micro USB port but it's actually a lightning connector so with a lot of these old battery cases you needed to carry on micro USB cords that's fine yes it is a little more common but just being able to carry around one cable and that's all you need to remember it's the bee's knees like no one says it's the bee's knees key like really really dawg like just go home you're not funny you're really funny and you're totally not fair some of the movi cases have a little bit of thickness but this isn't too bad I really like this and the best part about it is when you need to juice that power up hold down the button now says it's charging and then when you need to recharge the case or your phone does it both one operation here plug the lightning cord in there for 20 bucks not a bad option but there's better the next case is a little more expensive but you get these few more features in a larger battery capacity so instead of thirty two hundred million hours on the original case I just showed you this was 3600 milliamp hours and it has a built-in magnet so if you got a car mount you're set to go what's cool about this one too like the last one is it charges with a lightning cord so you don't need to have a microUSB cable or anything like that and the button is on the bottom that's just a personal preference I like having the button on the bottom versus the back just easier for me Keaton like if I have a 3.5 millimeter jack headphones your standard headphones and I use the adapter will it work and that's the deal breaker on the cases that charge with a lightning port you can't use the ear pods you can't use the adapter you're pretty much just stuck with bluetooth headphones which isn't a bad option if you have some Apple earpods and you haven't lost them now to pull this off if you have a pair of ear pods you're good to go but if you can't afford them actually checked out a cheaper option they're like $99 air pod killers I'll leave a link right up there in the iCard Wow like this is actually really solid you charge this up you just hold down the button here you can see the LED indicators pop up let you know how much battery the case has even the buttons on the side feel good the volume buttons super clicky you have your mute switch you have complete access to sleep-wake not a bad option and you're getting 3600 milliamp hours or the firm few extra bucks but now the real case even with this this is what we've all been waiting for not the case that I've been loving for the last week and the one that you're most excited for this thing costs around 60 bucks but why it's awesome is it has the largest battery capacity I've ever seen any battery case and as you can tell in the box it has wireless charging built-in that means no cables doesn't matter you're good to go like you just set it down on your wireless charger and you're chilling it's beautiful beautiful so let's pop the top on this and show you guys what's good with it like it's solid oh my 4200 milliamp hours you're gonna be set there your iPhone 4709 powers like that's almost 2 full charges right there my math right 2 plus 2 is 4 minus 1 that's free pretty much everything in yourself dude I can't afford 60 bucks for the best case ever actually checked out a $3 iPhone case what's cool about this one really solid and will actually protect your phone I'll leave that video right up there in the iCard you want to check that out after this one there is one catch about this case if you want to recharge it with the port at the bottom it's not lightning but it's micro USB shouldn't really matter you have a wireless charger if you don't have one picked up I'll leave it linked down below to the coolest one out there to take your iphone 10 here you slide it down all the other cases are one piece designs I kind of like this two-piece one this is nice because the case actually comes above you screen itself so when you set it down the actual glass of your phone isn't touching the surface this is kind of the closest option I think moppy would make it looks exactly like a movi case your buttons are exposed you can actually see the body of the iPhone so obviously how this charged up your phone you hold down the button here see the LED indicator you heard it for yourself you need a wireless charger or you can just do it by the cord this is a wireless charger that I found it's pretty cheap I'll leave it link down below and what's cool about it is is it looks like a camera lens I haven't seen anyone else find this yet so when you put your phone down to charge up the case and the phone check this out listen it plays the shutter noise look at that now your phone is charging please the shutter noise like when you take a photo coolest wireless charger coolest battery case ever because it has wireless charging built in it I think it's gonna be your favorite see guys those are the best battery cases on
