do you guys know that I love checking out new and different types of gadgets but a lot of you always asked like key what are your favorite types of gadgets and it's the food gadget I'm always hungry what can I say so a few months back I made this video on a 3d pancake printer it was straight madness if you missed it I'll leave it right up there in the iCard and then this ice cream ball that you kick and shake it's pretty much a soccer ball and somehow ice creams form I don't even know so what I want to show you guys are five different food gadgets that I picked up on Amazon you want to check them out I'll leave a link down below and straight up since I haven't eaten anything today let's just get right into this video your boys hungry and we have an earthquake but first we got this keyboard walk line it's the most expensive out of this list but I was like yo it's a keyboard waffle iron vote up in the iCard if you guys are wonderful people or pancake people I won't judge anyone and if you say french toast french toast is also really good all right whoa I was not expect I mean it's expensive wow this is really well built I don't know what I was expecting I mean it has to be metal he's about to go through it so you pretty much just get your waffle batter you heat your stovetop up and you just set this down and it it looks like a keyboard if it really looks like a keyboard solid build magnets to the only thing left to do is head back to my apartment and see if we can make a keyboard waffle I can't even open it to magnet is that strong or I'm just out I'm probably just that feature we're back at the apartment now we're gonna actually try this out with the keyboard waffle iron got it hot we're due to get stuck with the gas burner not taking it out to the grill there we go dude I don't think we have enough batter oh of course it's going over the data side how do I mess this up how do I mess this up heat and Fieri trash cooker and hopefully it looks like a keyboard not a mouse now we're gonna flip it no strength the wrists your wrists new year all right let's check the progress perfect kind of looks like a keyboard nailed it that looks like a keyboard to me just don't mess up your own batter placement I'm a goof goof next up is a self stirring mug and sent us the wintertime normally I'd make some hot chocolate or hot cocoa fun fact I used to put water and then the cocoa mix in there I just learned you're supposed to heat up milk and do it that way I'm learning tons this year so this is the cheapest thing on the list that goes for nine bucks definitely the most worth it to be asking me and basically how this goes down self stirring mug there's a button right here and these Triple A batteries at the bottom super easy I even got those rechargeable ones from that Fry's video if you know what I'm talking about and then you just hit the button here and then the fan kind of in the middle and see it's moving that's how it's gonna circulate all your dry ingredients when you put it in the mug so since we're not making hot cocoa we're gonna make some kool-aid and we're gonna chill so we got some red kool-aid here I don't even think we need this much kool-aid mix but that's what we're about to do so you clearly mix it in there add your water so just stir this up press the button we got the centripetal force it's like a tornado I want to say centripetal force that's a typical what have I really been out of school that long so we just got a light so you guys can see it a little better it is centripetal force I had to look it up I I don't like to get my science terms wrong here good old mass times velocity squared over radius baby you know what's about and you can see you got your spiral in the middle hold down the button for a few seconds your drink's gonna be all churned still really sorry this product here has got me the most scared because we're about to make our own sushi so it's a sushi bazooka kit it's pretty easy from the videos that I've been seeing on Amazon I asked you guys on the insta story to vote if I'm gonna fail making sushi for the first time I'm about to make sushi for the first time in my life we're making an avocado roll drop a like if you guys are a fan of sushi maybe I'm the only one but the sushi bazooka kit and it's just it's really coming out there pretty much you get your bamboo mat all set up here and how this works is you take this plastic mold here and you separate the plunger part and you open it up shout out to Emmy in Japan for actually showing me how to do this I watched your video I'll leave it linked down below thank you so much Emmy I would not have been able to work this and barely make cereal in the morning look at me fail on the last mug part so you load up rice got some got some I'm like failing I can't even pick up some trays she's I'm not even be able to make sushi and what's really funny here if you had to go to three different sushi restaurants like Kyle was telling me every time you walk into a store and like after the ingredients they're like do you want sushi we're like no we got to make it our own so first step we're gonna take our rice here all right you know what use your hands just use your hands I washed my hands we're good everyone that cheats this sushi will probably be alright that's some sticky rice wow that is really sticky rice you're supposed to space out the rice in the tube so once you have the rice in both portions of the tube you're gonna take the plunger tool and you're just gonna kind of push it down creating like a little notch or like a pocket put your ingredients in there all ingredients I don't even know why I just said that but my case it's gonna be a cod Oh Emmy thank you so much for making that video I would have no idea how to work this otherwise we're gonna take our slices of avocado now layer that on in dude we going to mash up to you and your after this one there couldn't grow on the menu it's not a crab cake it's a crab okay so once you have your sushi all set up I had to add a little more extra avocado because if I don't the rice is just gonna collapse in on itself so now you're gonna take the plunger here put it right in the groove there take one half the tube click it together I mean it's a bazooka after all okay just like that the bazooka is slowly but surely forming and just latch it down so you guys can see we have our avocado and our rice just coming out the top there you'll be able to see your ingredients and if you're doing like a half-decent job so now you take the bazooka cap you put it on there and then you need to twist the plunger part five times just keep it tight so one two three four one one take the cap off and let's bazooka out some sushi Lee's work oh we got some sushi coming out what No that is dark we're not doing the greatest jobs No get off the nori three hours later oh yeah that's it this is actually working whoa we're making sushi whoa it's getting easier I am shocked okay I don't want to jinx myself but that's not a bad looking sushi roll for my first time give it a nice roll whoa yes we are making sushi well kinda maybe and just just like that I'm gonna say that's a sushi roll and there you have it sushi an avocado roll we got a little bit of mint chocolate chip ice cream here throw this on alright here we go first time making sushi and using chopsticks all in one Oh spicy the Rice's been coming to my nose this'll win this next one I couldn't pass up it's called the grilled cheesus and it's pretty much what you're expecting it's a grilled cheese with Jesus Christ's face on the outside they could be both sides pretty much I'm sorry pesos I didn't mean that the grilled cheesus is heating up right now and when you open it you're actually gonna that's getting hot really fast you can see Jesus Christ's face will be on both sides of your bread so we're gonna let this heat up do its thing and prepare the first grilled cheese I've ever made for you guys we're good we got to get the grilled cheese on ASAP we got both slices of our bread here I can't believe it's not butter like what else isn't how do you guys make your grilled cheese am I doing this right let me know in the comments tables all butter you know we have plates and no one said anything Oh course Kyle let's drop it in on the mold pull right off the bat you can hear them sizzling my best of luck mr. Christ best of luck come out cheesy it ain't easy being cheesy the green light pops on when the machines ready or when mr. Christ is ready to be eaten oh and just like that the green light came on let's open it up thanks no play Kyle oh no that is hot but we got it a holy grilled cheese I would grab it with my fingers that is hot that's officer can we see mr. Christ's face on the grilled cheese kinda you turn your head a little bit you squint to touch you can kind of see Jesus Christ's face on a grilled cheese it's a good pun though the last product is probably the most simple one on the list it is an iPhone thermometer and what's cool about it is it just plugs in to your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and your phone still has one and you'll be able to start reading times we're gonna be able to jeez that just took way too much effort so the range can detect food up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit you got the dongle here because my iPhone 8 plus doesn't have a headphone jack not even funny starting a funny joke once you have the app all installed my notifications sweet just tell me what the food Kempis quick update on the range right now it's not working and I just checked the app which has been updated for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 so I'm assuming a dongle won't do it we got the app on tile 6s with the headphone jack and when you push it into your food for example a temperature should come up it's not the coming-up so with the power of Jesus we overnighted a second one and hopefully that works I'll be back 24 hours later so it's the next day the second range actually showed up let's try to fire up the app and see if this works send me the notifications give me everything I'm actually using my 6s plus with the headphone jack just so we don't have any dongle problems if that's what's causing this thing not to work right it works Wow I didn't think it was gonna work alright let's see if it warms up just with my hands there you go it's going up let's take him out finesse it off here perfect there we go got the grilled cheesus all set let's see what the actual temperature of this grilled cheese is here we go it just shoots up instantly peep this it's climbing alright a hundred and eighty-three degrees is this grilled cheese that's pretty sure for this video make sure you guys get subscribed with notifications turned on and let me know in the comments if you guys are just joining the notice squad follow us on the instance story because that's where all the behind the scenes are happening with the crew and stay hungry bye friends peace
