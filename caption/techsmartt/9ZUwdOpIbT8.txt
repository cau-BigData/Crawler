was the last time a headphone jack was at the top of an iPhone that looks like an iPhone 6 okay we're in the drone section we got 2 minutes and 25 seconds left oh this looks good 109 bucks it looks like it's got some actual specs on it like a cover real camera $100 drone let's see if this is good all right come on so this bad scene on TV I okay it's a rechargeable lighter flame never dies $5.00 speaker I just want to see if it sucks 37 seconds left add that in there let's run a check good we're going through the window alright there's our timer item let's go to checkout see what the total is so we're at checkout right now we're just waiting for someone that I like call us and say we can go check out six items I think we're gonna be looking right under 200 bucks 250 max no way it's 300 I'm excited you got some actually good stuff like not crap 180 937 the receipt so we're back at the studio now I actually lost the receipt I'm sorry what can you expect but I spent a hundred and eighty nine dollars for everything here and then the other receipt below is through some other stuff I had to pick up and fry some like printer ink you don't even care about that but the first thing that I want to check out and I'll leave links down to everything in the description below are these triple-a rechargeable batteries so I've never seen anything like this before these things actually charge up with microUSB you have one of these cables in your house I'll guarantee it and they look sweet they're called jewel cell 450 million powers I don't actually know the capacity of triple-a batteries let me know in the comments if you guys know but let's dig on into this these things come free charge which you gotta love okay wow that's sweet we got a camo go figure and then these little rechargeable triple-a batteries I'm acting like this is the first time I've ever seen a battery high I've actually seen a battery before the coolest thing about these rechargeable batteries is you doing it to plug him into a wall like you can plug him in with your laptop and you're pretty much set is we got a self stirring mug that we're gonna try this out with damn like i'm actually hyped about some batteries i don't say that every day all right sweetie gonna throw the bottom back on self stirring mug you compete bit it's legit got a little drank from MacDonnell's just gonna fill that on up haven't washed this mug yet so let's hope I don't get sick here we go ready you can hear it it's churning it I'm holding it down I know I was probably stupid to put coke it's dark you probably can't see it but you can hear it the motors running on the self stirring mug and if you don't believe me you can see the fan is actually working here rechargeable batteries definitely a win next up is this LED bulb you can control with your phone for 20 bucks I thought it sounded pretty cool sounded pretty cool looks pretty cool I don't even know my five senses let's hope it works it has an app too and what's interesting is lighting facts on the side it looks like it's a food cart or wait what is it a calorie Nutrition Facts I don't even read them alright so we got our lighting facts he let's just open this up okay if you might have got an open box one that flue is tampered with before the video okay sweet got our bulb pretty simple anything else in the box no what am I even saying wow no no no yeah so once you get the app all installed it's called colorful light open it up here okay get a nice little color wheel right there you can see all your lights connected it only got one bulb let's hope this works 20 bucks I don't really know this would be an awesome Philips II replacement I'm gonna turn it pink I'm gonna look behind me if it's pink it's a way it's pink that's okay that's sweet that was so overdramatic but I am happy that well of course I'm happy cone for gradient color flash random gradient go into purple tank white oh I'm actually surprised I didn't think there would be this many features Wow all right what else voice this'll be sweet if this works think of it like talking the light will change to my voice and like the frequency of it play that blink-182 song while we bleed to death in Tucson okay gonna turn on random color and start it's going to the sound of my voice yeah it's just capturing if we can see there's a ton of other stuff you can change the color I think the higher I get in my voice the brighter the bulb becomes [Applause] [Music] the frequency that is sweet next up is the sketchiest by the $5 speakers that I tripped lost everything I had almost ran out of time for let's see how good these are $5 speakers if they even play music that's a win so we got these opened up it looks like for five bucks they require use B power and then obviously you need your audio source so let's plug it on in I got a sweet track for you guys your oh oh it's talking to us alright let's see how these sound five bucks here we go you know the song that's pretty loud right max volume two I was expecting these to be a lot crap here for five bucks definitely most surprising by now I made fun of this one inside fries I don't even know how I had time for jokes I only had five minutes to shop we got in LED flash and what's interesting is this is an iPhone 6 or it could be a success I don't know and the LED flash looks like it's plugged into a headphone jack at the top I don't know how but let's open this up the headphone jack it's like where'd they get this image from okay alright I'm starting to see how they pulled this off this makes sense so it's a LED flash that plugs into the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack if your phone still has one but recharges with microUSB so to turn it on grab a phone I don't it's not gonna be plugged in but Oh power on switches on the side you can hold it up with the headphone jack I guess my voice cracks - wow this isn't that bad pretty bright 16 LEDs and it's dimmable whoa so I got a headphone jack - lightning adapter welcome to the game of dongles let's see how this would look if you don't have an iPhone with the headphone jack anymore and it's just hanging here I'm doing its thing please bring back the headphone jack and we'd all appreciate it just like hold my phone up it's so weird you can actually change the brightness so this is low medium and high beep this real quick oh wow that's that's definitely noticeable and you guys know this from the room tour if you had to check this video out I'll leave it right up in the iCard but I have 6 studio lights on me now so if you're in your room or your car this thing's really right like really really really bright this thing doesn't actually sit that bad now before we check out the rechargeable lighter the thing that has got me really excited for this video let's check out this drone here so it's called the Navigator drone who really intrigued me was not the price it was like about a hundred bucks but some of the features that it has is any drone that has a head holding mode has got me excited I want a drone when I'm flying it just to be able to stay put in the air it's nice not all drones have it so got a 720p HD Wi-Fi camera guessing it can stream over the app wide-angle lens alright let's fire this up and see how it is oh there's a virtual reality mode - custom flight route boats there we go whoa ok is the drone oh wow this actually looks pretty sophisticated hundred bucks yeah no that's like not a cheap drone at all battery just slides on in the back yo this looks like an Xbox controller pull it out then you got your cable to recharge off that battery some extra props baby get up for a hundred bucks now you can fly this drone with the included remote but there's actually an app I'm guessing that's where all the Wi-Fi streaming goes down flying speed alright decent looking app so far power on the drone first got some green and red lights no it's the holiday season then just need to connect to the drones Wi-Fi signal it's outputting oh wow that's looking good you can instantly see the camera let's get this thing flying so this is what the app looks like I'm gonna hit record and then this button here just allows the drone to take off from what I heard it's pretty solid it just goes right up oh my Wow pretty stable to drop stars are good they protect the walls and they protect your boy why this prop guards takes you baby we got it well this is hopefully good deal for a hundred bucks there's actually a flight map feature on here so I have the drone takeoff I can draw a route draw like draw a box check the drone it knows the route I'm pretty shot hundred bucks good drone this is the item that I was so hyped to see at Fry's it's a rechargeable lighter call the atomic lighter and seen a bunch of these on Instagram drop a like on this video if you made it this far and you've heard of this before sounds interesting okay if I can get it out of the box like goes flying off the table I'm sorry lighter if it doesn't work now I would be surprised so what you get inside the box is an included micro USB cable that's how you charge this thing on you got your mic USB port at the bottom and then your on/off switch so let's power this thing on basically you don't ever need to refill your lighters with fuel even buy a new one you just charge this thing up and you're good I'm excited here we go here we go hit the button or did you see you then you could probably hear it it sounds really high-pitched you got this purple cross here it's hot it's hot enough to burn something there's only one thing left to do got a piece of paper here will it actually burn we got fire that is fire that is this new invention called a smoke alarm right above that purple beam just set okay we're just setting everything on fire I'm shocked this thing was totally worth died and the smoke that's pretty sure for this video make sure you get subscribed with notifications turned on if you're new so you don't miss another episode of impulse buys and let me know in the comments if you guys are just joining an Otis squad make sure you follow us on the into story because that's where all the behind the
