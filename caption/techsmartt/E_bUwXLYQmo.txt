[Music] or what could be as a crazy crazy video and if you don't know what I'm talking about check the iCard right up there for the $99 air pod chill I'm diggin it I'm diggin it I made this video and I had no idea that it would pop that's the magic of YouTube and the magic of you guys so you know make sure you get subscribed but in this video which is sponsored by funcle' they're putting that claim to the test since air pods were released we've seen a ton of options pop up so much so new prices are coming up this one's nineteen to twenty nine dollars no joke that's the range it's not been confirmed yet that's how new this video is might even be the first on this and hey if it's big which it probably could be at this price you never know you saw it here first I got the black one white one and then the same colors so the tiny ones here are called the W ones and then the bigger ones are just called VA ones and they're a little bit different but the coolest thing about these is the price and what they offer really if they work so let's check out the W ones 19 to 29 bucks 49 to 69 bucks so it's about [Music] the easy box funcle' cool you guys have chickened out I'll leave a link down below the basic stuff you get Quick Start Guide you don't really need it that's why you're watching this right and some ear tips so one thing I wish the air pods had because they don't fit all ears so here are the W ones now let's check out pretty confident new your tips actually confident kid to that all right let's whoa a little bit bigger of a case so as you can tell the W ones are smaller than the a eyes and that's because the a eyes have yo AB dig it alright alright it's not bad I do like the case I'm always up for something that's a little bulkier because honestly I'm here to say this is my 29th pair of air pods you guys saw it on the instant story if you're not following just pack smart I lose these things like at odd cakes and at 159 bucks pretty expensive so both the W ones in the AIS come with features at pretty crazy prices and that's just what I'm about to find out how good it is so to pair up the AIS which actually have the Qualcomm aptX that's a mouthful chip inside which is kind of cool because it's featured on higher-end headphones and with these Bluetooth earbuds or earphones whatever you want to call it and let me know in the comments what you call them it's kind of a feature you wouldn't expect I mean on this price it's as easy as pulling them out and putting them in your ears and just like that everything's connected so just going to bluetooth it's pretty easy to set up so what we're gonna do is listen to the PBJs playlist it's a playlist I update every single week on Spotify doing some cool new music stuff you want to check that out link down in the description who this week we got some Steve Aoki and blink-182 this is the more higher end version let's see how these are we're still learning the lyrics it's a new song just came out last Friday ooh mids are really good high ends nice ok bass with the AP TX chip so what that basically means is a lower latency pipeline I had to look this up I didn't even believe it myself it basically allows for a better sound to come through and that's on the ai's so for 49 to 69 bucks pretty good pretty good I like the case it's large enough where you're not gonna lose him and that's basically something you need to keep in mind you don't want to be buying 29 pairs like me so are they the air pod killer we need to test it out with the W ones so these are the little guys and on these are something kind of cool so the feature four-and-a-half hour battery life and for something as Tiny as this I'm kind of shocked F check that out can you believe that four and a half hours dude that is nuts so four and a half hours on a full charge the case comes with three extra charges and that's the same with the ais but yes have six hours of battery life with three extra charges so you have a full 24 hours so that's another big difference better battery life on the more expensive ones if you loved expensive ones I mean it all really depends how they sound okay are you getting this right here you see how it just tucks right in there what do you think be honest with me how does it look and you guys let me know but up in the iCard you think it looks cool or not it's an interesting feeling if there's something definitely in there if I had to pick one right now I would go jump for the eight eyes but if these things sound good I mean the price can't really beat it alright let's check out another song on the playlist seriously guys check it out if you like it maybe hit it up on Twitter it's just at PBJ [Music] I mean if I was going for a jog I don't really think these are gonna fall out of my ears and I think that's an advantage to the W ones over the a is you can still run with these but I think these are more of your everyday bud you know the more higher inversion Wow they're nice it's like a cozy sound mitts are nice low end I think is better on the W once been on the AIS but that's just my personal opinion you guys gotta check these out and let me know on Twitter mmm you checking these out after this video so I'll be honest I'm kind of impressed with the price in this sound anything that works is all I really need with a wireless earbud I want something that sounds good but something where if I lose it and I mean I don't think I will with cases like this it's a bulky but it's nice where you can feel it in your pocket and the price if you do lose it it's okay you can replace it and basically for a hundred and sixty bucks on the air pots if I don't know about you but this seems like the holiday gift I'm getting everyone also both of these have Bluetooth 5.0 and that's a first for me in any earbud that I've seen I haven't really checked out bluetooth 5.0 on headphones earphones or really anything of that nature yet until this video the one advantage that the a eyes have though is I px5 certification so that means like sweat a little bit of water resistance you're covered the W ones don't but after you get for the price and they come with the funcle' app so you can pair it up get some songs in there and really go ahead basically find a better sound so am i impressed honestly yes I think these could actually be a massive killer only time will tell and I'm sure with the price when it is announced and you guys know I'll let you know on Twitter keep it locked over there I think it could be a banger and I really like the case they work I'm really good and that aptX chip is nice so yeah let me know in the comments what you guys think on this video and that's it for this one if you guys are new make sure to drop a like and
