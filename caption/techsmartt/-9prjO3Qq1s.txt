hey what's good guys welcome back to techsmartt and I'm here with basically the tech dad you guys know him as Linus Sebastian aka Linus tech tips and Linus had this crazy idea so you might have seen I mean you just tell me idea this wasn't my idea this is your idea basically you're like oh I have no idea where we're gonna store all of our video footage whatever shall I do so I went to Linus and was like hey I need a server because we're expanding a lot here allegedly this is hundred and forty terabytes in it is that right well that's not actually in here now this is just an empty box I haven't built anything ever so we're about to build a phat server is this an ass or raid I'm a noob when it comes to this this is my first time this is a hundred and forty terabytes of precision manufactured electronics that is the gasps Wow whoa oh you got 12 you're up you helped me set this up I don't even know this is the first time I've open this box Seagate hooked you the hook up that's 180 terabytes so just to give you guys a background I have never built anything technical the channel might be called tech smart but that is the complete opposite sewing the smart is with hold my hand over there oh yeah I really do feel like your tech dad stop stop you're killing me so there they're rated for use all together so even when they're like vibrating next to each other that's cool that's safe okay and perhaps most importantly they have included data recovery service ooh so if one of these fails I mail it in and the hope it out and as long as it is recoverable they will do their best within reason have you been careful with this for the last few months because they knew who they were sending it to handle with care' please two exclamation marks right there two T's two exclamation marks it makes sense Wow 45 drives I only count 15 what's up with that line that's their original enclosure was all about 45 drives in a for you now they have models with 15 30 60 take your time oh wait you want me to put the box back up you don't put the bug hey do you even have a screwdriver yes of course Philips flat really so let's see how quick that works see how he doesn't know that computers don't use flat heads it doesn't do you have this whoever edits this you gotta leave that in uncut so people know just how short the period of time in between me telling you what screwdriver he needs and him forgetting whatever I got the flat Ettore about it so first step is you're going to take off those six screws do you remember where they are come on dad don't embarrass me like this in front of my front of my audience men I don't think anyone could embarrass you in front of your audience more than you've embarrassed yourself in front of your audience all right let's open this up tech quickie so just like a normal computer it's got a CPU yep but it's a Xeon instead of a core i5 or a core i7 server willing to yeah basically the same damn thing but more expensive then you got RAM how how much RAM is this and why don't we have always filled up this is eight gigs of RAM and the reason we don't have it all filled up is that this is just a storage machine okay and it just doesn't really need it gotcha and if it looks like I'm sweating I'm just nervous to be around Dan I haven't seen him in a few years so it's a little toasty in here to make me very uncomfortable this is a power flight nice so this supplies the power that's what it means then right here we've got an SSD we will probably not end up using this one okay I think you and I are probably gonna run down two fries this right here is just a USB Drive okay yeah so this is actually gonna hold our operating system like you don't boot off a hard drive yeah we're actually gonna boot up off this what else we got in here that's new or these cables and these cables and all these cables these are for the metric wack ton of drives this is the store inator so all your drives are gonna go shoot choo choo choo all the way across here and this thing's gonna get real heavy real fast so we're gonna have a hundred and eighty terabytes of raw storage but using unread we actually lose the capacity of one of them so we're gonna have a hundred and sixty usable but what that means is that extra one is doing what's called parity so parity means that any one of these drives can outright fail burst into flames so you would actually not even notice you could have your machine running the whole time you can have all your stuff safely backed up away from you know mother Google no monthly fees Wow OBS no nothing everything here belongs to you so Alanis now that we got basically everything out of the box some stuff still in the box what do we do now there's not actually a lot of assembly required so all we got to do is take all those drives and put them in here do you guys have knives we don't have those in the States you guys that's a can't that's a Canadian only product you just have guns okay so the way to tell how this goes in is you got the connector so you're kind of on off to the side I'm so happy you came you came Linus it makes me feel so good just know when I get the time that we once had growing up you know makes him feel so good knowing that I came he was the funniest out of everyone else in this one is to attack Wow tech people aren't really known for their funny tech funny over here bro with two eyes I don't know about that oh stop you're killing me wow this is really sweet so you've done this before with mkbhd I just seen maybe some others Austin to has no no less than one the first gospel all right dad so what is next so now all we got to do is connect it to your network so we need to never switch so yeah what is that stop stop you're killing me all right our networks which is way over there so we're gonna head to fries which is gonna be so awesome and go grab a really long cable so cat6 snatcher I don't know we get in like a Siamese cable adoption I want to get black and yellow black and yellow but you know I love I love it it's funny cause like I think urinating it when it comes to tech but and then you think I'm an idiot when it comes to like anything clever Fulcher yeah I'm the definition of cool through the aisle I've never been down because I get always so scared and self-conscious that daddy's gonna hit me if I buy the wrong thing I'm the definition of cool so you still are gonna need cash drives okay but they don't have to be as big I'm broke though bro I can't afford the cash if again so they don't need to be as big because what the cash drive does do is it lets do copy files on to it a lot faster to the cash lets you write to it fast and then it sits on the cash and then overnight it'll flush it to the hard drives what this is is this has eight gigabit ports and two 10 B ports so what this would allow you to do is have an ingest station that has a fast link jeunesse so when you're copying things over you can copy it like 200 300 megabytes a second marques didn't do this and emailed me the other week and was like hey okay I think I probably should have done the SSDs Thank You marques I'm not making that mistake like what I'd really like to do is go with 860 pros [Music] you want to do a haul video let's go so we got don't dump it out on this yes okay so we got our 10 gigs which a little more emotion and excitement to fold it up to the camera do the hand they have hard time the cameras have hard time focusing they have to do it with their hand so it grabs the focus there like so this brush here looks really nice another ethernet cable that's your girl voice and then we've got a couple 1 terabyte SSD these that we're gonna use for a data cache we also lost the screws it gotta be somewhere we probably have it on camera can someone just you know what let's just stop it and we'll go back and we'll find him I feel like I'm in NASCAR right now doing a pit stop change you have a knife that's a tough sticker screwdriver okay well good if you were gonna open it like that I could have done that fine you know why even fair okay so I'm gonna hold this for you go take out one of these screws so we're doing a little trick where SSDs have no moving parts so they don't really need to be held in that well so we're taking the screws from one and we're using it for to someone at home is gonna try to build their own nests and it's gonna catch on fire just because of this one thing you're batshit is going the other way are you not noticing this is a ratcheting screw to see ratchet in my generation - that means a whole different thing do you need me to show you how to use it maybe so now and we're gonna take out the other hp1 yeah I want to do the second clip you know me I want to do it I want to feel like I'm contributing here's our data Kaitlin let you do the other one are you sure you're putting on there I am a little scared and asking a lot it's keyed there's that else yeah right there yeah I still can't see what you're doing so I'm just worried you gotta trust me Dad it's been 21 years oh I don't want to disappoint you and Mom oh it's a really fragile connector you shouldn't need to wiggle it country do it for your country all right I tried can I see I did it with one hand do you want to close your eyes to on this next one I could our cache is installed nice we've got that cache that's you can say that right is a kid set open that is we're making this so I didn't know you were that intersect whoa dude I'm just feigning for the gear so we gotta put this next to your wireless ready okay and plug it into the wall uh and also you need to plug this into into one of the network supports on the wildest project so guess what you get to do now call the number and say we need help no get to turn it on here goes the switch f you ready you cut in this you get in this big moment big moment big moment you gotta press the power button I hit the power button back and that's for the power supply see this is why I need the help you turned it off you know you turned the power supply off bro no it's not it meant now it says it's on a holes not plugged in OH so who's editing this how much do I have to pay you under the table to make sure that all the embarrassing stuff oh it's gonna be in there it's on because I plugged it in and that would mean the time because I plugged it do you see a green light on the motherboard it's on there's a blue light oh all right so I'm on the same network so theoretically all I have to do is type in HTTP colon slash slash Tower amazing so that is unraised server Pro this is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time because I've never really ventured down the technical path of tech so okay you tweaking this setting right here lets you decide between higher performance with more wear on your drives okay or lower performance with more power consumption and less wear on your drives if I choose the option where it's more stress and also higher performance is that gonna compromise I mean it's probably fine so you want to higher performance one yeah okay this is really important what do you want to call it I'm thinking power call it NAS we got some pop culture work to work now have nothing in common you and I - I hate you to be here I paid you to be here you didn't pay nothing we've got to parody drives look we've got 13 storage trucks we've got to cache drives and and you click start you want to do the honors can you find the click on it I don't think I'm ready let's just power it down all right here we go the big moment okay give it min it's gonna spin all this stuff up well here's the thing so did you know if solid-state wraps they don't have anything to spin he hits me so much this yellow thing here parody is invalid that's because it actually needs to build a loop that data set so it's just checking it doesn't mean any data from like me or any media no in fact you could even use it right now okay so you can see right here we have unmount Abul disks all of them are firing up yeah we got a format them it'll actually take a couple days oh you have so much storage a hundred and fifty-six useable terabytes is what we ended up with after some few parity to parity drives now we've got a bunch of raw storage sitting here okay accessible over the network next stage is we got to create some shares so basically what I'm setting up right now is so all of your stuff that doesn't have to be high performance is just going straight to the hard drives and not even bothering your SSDs and then we could find some file let's go see what - is downloaded lately here's an oppo find 10 first look so just straight dragging it from anywhere on the laptop and now we are playing that off the nest right now for some reason it's derping it's there we go and to the NASA's credit it just was built and it's still building itself so that's it what we're done fun times over that's it I never knew what all this was this is my first time honestly building anything well we're gonna put this back together but thank you so much Linus Seagate unread as well as 45 dries so that's it for this video make sure check out the video we did on lines to channel in the description that room tour they ready for it and you can check out more lines of stuff link down below like social media his favorite hi guys see you later
