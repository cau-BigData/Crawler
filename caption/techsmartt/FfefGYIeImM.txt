So the iPhone X being out for almost two months now usually by this point Everyone's found those hidden features the tips and tricks the stuff that Apple doesn't tell you so with the help of the text mark Kruk Kiel Matt myself we have gone through Reddit and Twitter to find all the hidden features and just secret cool tricks That you don't know about on your iPhone 10, so some of these include improving speed Quality and the camera app which is pretty cool So let's check it out so the first trick actually lets you shoot photos on your iPhone 10 and a few other iPhone models - and run quickly vote up in the iCard if you guys use the Regular camera app or another camera app to take your photos Basically this works on the iPhone 6s - 7 the SE the 8 and of course the iPhone 10 so with the default camera app on your iPhone 10 You can't shoot RAW photos so to do this we're gonna be using an app I downloaded called halide it cost 5 bucks I'll leave a link down below If you guys want to check it out and what this app allows you to do is shoot RAW photos and really just Customize the exposure the shutter speed and do a lot of other things that many other camera apps let you customize So this allows you to take raw photos is dope because when I head outside in a second I can really kind of start to see where the shot is gonna be composed and Ultimately take it into Lightroom to bring out some of the other details that a raw photo would offer so if you guys don't know What a raw photo is basically it takes a flat image and then in post-production you can really flirt up and customize it so the sun is shining at your camera and kind of blowing out the image with the Raw photo, you kind of change that post-production, so you're getting a blue sky you're getting the details you really want and some of the other features in the halide app obviously besides allowing you to toggle on and Off a raw photo you can also go ahead and change the exposure just by sliding up and down It's pretty smooth And buttery just being able to slide up and then pull back your exposure you can change the manual focus This is actually pretty sweet, so I go to the left here it brings it auto focus quickly back to the middle and focus It's just really customizable and intuitive We're gonna go outside right now and take two separate photos one is just your standard JPEG The other is raw and you'll see for yourself how much of it since it makes So we're outside now about the  halide app so as you can see I have a non raw photo, so just your standard JPEG It's about to be taken so we're gonna do it before and after bump the exposure up a little bit good looking shot All right now. Let's turn Raw on Sweet so just like that I took our two photos, so now you're seeing both photos side by side And you guys can definitely tell what the capabilities are of? Shooting raw so the 6s the seven and the eight as well as the ten are the only iPhones that can shoot RAW photos And you need an app like a lead to make this all happen like honestly. I'm in Preston Let me know in the comments if you guys can tell the difference too It works now this next trick is supposed to improve the speed and efficiency of the power button on the iPhone 10 And I've kind of seen this work iffy on my iPhone 10 it definitely works on Matt's he's back in New York right now So I can't show you let me know in the comments if this actually works for you guys or dozen But basically when you have an iPhone 10 And you double click the power button on the side Apple pay comes up so when that comes up a task for your face You know wants to make sure you're actually using your phone So you can pay for whatever you want now to turn this off And this is supposed to improve the efficiency and overall speed of locking your device you want to just turn off double click side button so when you press the button once and you have this feature turned on it's waiting around to see if there's gonna be a Second click there to present all your cards for Apple pay now when you have this turned off, and you just click it once It's gonna turn your phone off, so let's see if this actually works I mean this kind of does work on some iPhone 10 seriously Let me know in the comments if it works on your phone so when I click the button here turns off nice and easy So I'll lock it turn it on and see if there's a delay Okay It's like a solid second delay you can hear the pause in there for me like I don't notice any difference I've seen this work on his phone. You can trust me on that maybe they fixed it I don't really think they did maybe just my iphone 10 is being weird Probably is now this next trick speeds up the whole face unlock process, and it does actually work I tried it for myself so basically when I unlock my iPhone 10 right now I have to really get my face lined up for the phone to recognize my face and unlock so obviously I can swipe up and I'm Good to go now, but say you want to speed this up, or let's just say for example. You're in bed You're laying down you got off the double chin going face ID sometimes has a hard time recognizing when you're laying down that It's actually your face although. You're the one holding the phone and no one else is with you in your room You live in that life so to speed this up. You're gonna scroll on down you're gonna. Go to face ID and passcode Put your passcode in and then turn off Require attention for face IDs so once you turn this off It'll recognize parts of your face and unlock your iPhone so in most situations. That's gonna be fine. You're in your bed. You're by yourself No one's trying to unlock your iPhone X or steal it from you But others like if you're sleeping with someone I could see why you'd want to have it on so check this out When I turn my phone like this, and I just helped its ever so slightly it unlocks now. I'm gonna try to do that with Attention on you're gonna see it won't unlock same angle you can see the true depths trying to find my face But I've tilted up a little more for it to unlock so we'll try that one more time It's just like that that is a little movement little angle Your swiped up and you're good to go now at the beginning of this video I said I'd be showing you guys three different tricks for your iPhone 10 well There's actually a fourth a bonus one and it's with the wallpaper so since the iPhone 10 has a completely new different way of showing animations the wallpaper game has really stepped up and let me tell you I have the Coolest looking wallpapers that I'm about to show you so my buddy Tanner actually sent me this originally I'll leave a link down below for the full site where you guys can pick these up But basically when you go over to this site Just swipe over as you guys can see I just showed you guys a preview there There is this iPhone 10 wallpaper with a border, and it looks pretty sweet you guys can see the different previews You got gold a green and orange a yellow Just jump and right on into them So how this actually works is you need to set your wallpaper as a still keep reduce motion off and you never tap?
