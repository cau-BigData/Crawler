hey what's good guys welcome back to text mark for a really interesting video I'm sure a lot of you seen these on YouTube or in the news I mean YouTube right these are the brand new Samsung Galaxy buds that kind of come with the s10 if you pre-order it but I'm just looking at the techsmartt channel I'm sure you guys are commenting it right now keeping you've been checking out way too many air pods now the Galaxy air pods fake air pods earphones earbuds I think it's pretty safe to say you're a budtender now if are the new Samsung Galaxy buds and you've probably seen these all over YouTube tons of people have been getting them but Samsung only handed these out at the s10 event which I was at in San Francisco last weeks if you guys missed that it's not me it's a story I met up with everything Apple pro Philip and I had a great time but we didn't get galaxy s 10 so that's all gonna change this week tons of videos coming up so make sure you're subscribed with notifications on you're gonna see him in a few but right in front of me are the galaxy buds so they gave these out to everyone that attended the event and why these are special is the galaxy buds go for a hundred and twenty nine dollars compared to apples air pods I'm sure you've seen a few videos on these which go for a hundred and fifty nine dollars so basically figuring out how good is thirty dollars worth and of course we gotta bring the tried and true the trusty mug us keys never dusty of the i-10 tws so you guys have been commenting like crazy if you missed a video from wish it's right up there in the iCard you want to check out a cheaper pair there's a four dollar pair I'll leave all those links down below to everything in this video if you want to pick them up you guys know Samsung's made the icon X before those go for 179 dollars these are 129 so they come in three colors unlike the ear pods unless you get them customized you put a skin on there so take it into the box what else we get who's in your tips you get some interesting ear hooks it's like they include all the tips for you is that even for an ear edge what what I think is really cool about the galaxy buds and I haven't even tried them out yet is the USBC charging on the back and all Galaxy buds have wireless charging in the case so what's cool with the Galaxy S 10 this year is there's wireless charging built into the back and actually can charge other devices so just by setting your Galaxy buds down this is the Galaxy S 9 remember I didn't get a Galaxy S 10 it would charge just like that so kind of interesting cons the air pods don't do that right enough jibber-jabber what's really cool about these so the galaxy buds have a different shape compared to the air pods to put them in my ears they have a nice tight seal I actually feel like they are in my ears and whoa Sherlock they're pump the brakes yeah I know they are in my ears and they're not just hanging out like a toothbrush but what I do like about these is they just feel a little bit more comfortable and they were talking about this on stage and Samsung said the buds just have a tighter seal in the ear I can definitely feel that and I haven't even switched out these ear tips what I think is kind of cool and this is something off the test with the s10 is if the double microphones on the buds do anything if they help call quality if they really help accuracy you say I want to use big speed and just looking at the shape between the galaxy bud and the air pod you can tell there's something different going on this actually goes in your ear like traditional earphones or ear buds their Bluetooth feel pretty good I mean air pods just have felt standard for so long that just fits in I don't have to worry about it whoa that is kind of interesting I could just drop them in and not have to worry about it I know where the hole on my ear is but with the buds you almost have to just make sure it makes it in and that's interesting that's definitely something you have to remember to do and now that I have both an ear I feel like the air pod would be the first one to fall out and I got one of the three air pod tricks I made a video it's up there in the iCard it's got this little rubber thing so it should stay in your ear a little better it was only two dollars so interesting I am liking these butts interesting so battery life on these guys is estimated at around 6 hours whereas the air pods get around 5 hours drop a comment down below if you've ever got 5 hours of usage on your air pods that's just not real I don't believe that it's 2 years later they're not lasting that long even if you're buying them new so I don't believe that but with the galaxy buds I'm interested to see the battery life just because these have a larger case that I don't think I'd lose as easily as the thin air pods I know I'm on pair 37 right now but with the galaxy buds it's really just all about the touch pad with the air pods you can actually customize the controls on the sides with the see buds you have this touchpad right here use touchpad DoubleTap to play next triple tap to play a previous touch and hold decline call okay so pretty basic stuff so you got your equalizer you can customize notifications so which come through the buds and which don't but one thing that I do really appreciate is find my earbuds let's take these out and see how loud they get mixing a little bird chirping noise okay so you'll probably find your Galaxy buds if you ever lose them another cool thing about the app that I actually showed you guys on the three tricks you probably didn't know about air pods I'm dumb plug and I promise is the ambient sound so this is just one of the nice things on the galaxy buds is you can just hear the outside if you want to life hearing is exactly the same thing if you see the ear right there same thing on the iPhone but voice focus makes voices stand out more clearly from ambient sound how you do enough I can hear you it works so kind of a cool feature but really I think the only thing left to do is play some music so we're gonna jump into Spotify the P BGM is close I'll leave a link down below it's updated every single Friday so when you wake up you got new music delivered right to your Spotify or YouTube music or Apple music all links are down below to whatever platform you have for some reason my galaxy buds are not playing any audio and they're pretty cool I'm not gonna lie kind of like how they feel in the ear but if they can't play music that's a problem basically we're gonna go head up to Portland the Pacific Northwest we're gonna go see everything Apple Pro for a big week of Samsung stuff this video is gonna be the first one out and what we're gonna find out is oh good are the galaxy but we finally made it to Phillips house took a little bit miss three flights but on the fourth attempt we got there we got some plans in in for the week so you guys definitely ought to get subscribed to both channels I'll leave his link down below and make sure you have notifications turned on if only we had a Galaxy S 10 so we have Galaxy S 9 here I got Phillips galaxy buds and hopefully everything works so they're paired I want to see how they sound finally right had to fly what 900 miles to do this test would you choose for the song benleah temporary you guys know the place link down below PB jams on Spotify well dude you gotta follow that here we go it seems like it's not as loud on Samsung I've helped like blasting my ear that's full of all you mean air pods on no please connected to an iPhone as soon as you get well you can you connect them to an iPhone yeah well they're not as well I gotta connect them to an iPhone after this I only tried it out with the Samsung you know dude they call it tech smart but I think I picked the wrong YouTube name what give me your bud I got to see this on iPhone so this is how you get your galaxy buds to connect to an iPhone we had it once because yeah close the case so if you just hold like the left one boom galaxy buds also wants to connect to the s9 plus it works let's see how these sound on the iPhone definitely louder definitely louder on the iPhone something I didn't know you could do it's a lot more isolated yeah do they fall out for you it's a weird feeling I like on ear over all right so galaxy buds would you buy him 129 dollars versus 159 for ear buds right now it's for in even for iPhone users it's a good deal you can connect them they auto connect to iPhone like a Collard it's pretty true and with the galaxy buds if you preorder of s10 or nest em plus they are included so that's it for this video if you guys liked it make sure to drop a like get subscribed and make sure to turn notifications on to both our channels cuz I think we got a pretty interesting week ahead of us oh yeah all the videos all right I'll catch you guys soon
