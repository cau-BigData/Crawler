hey what's up guys welcome back to tech smart for what is Apple being classic Apple this time twice in the same year just announced are the brand new air pods Pro and if you don't remember a 2019 Apple dropped the air pods to or air pods with wireless charging case and a few extra perks so broke pods and now throat pods promo so you guys this is Apple doing an accessory first they've never even done this with the power beats or beats by dre line we have two pairs air pods in the same year row pods and broke pods Pro the big difference is $50.00 the air pods to or air pots with wireless charging case cost $199 compared to the air pods Pro at $249 and there's no physical changes in color really the case looks a little different it would be nice if the air pods Pro came in black kind of keep the whole pro lineup with Apple in line you know like pro my Mac Pro airpot SPRO in black that'd be cool let's do the ear pods we all get excited Apple wants you to get excited this could be the stocking stuffer in the holiday gift of the season but that's up to you and let me know in the comments how you guys are feeling about these because here's the big deal with the air box pro there's a few features you have active noise-cancelling this new mode called transparency mode which allows you to quickly click on just the ambient noise around you and it's all done from the shorter stem you're seeing it you're seeing it and I'm seeing it new also on the air pods Pro is the design there's no extra space there's no bulk this is the air pod as defined and refined as it could possibly be about half the size but if you look at the actual kind of ear tip well now there's actually an ear tip and there's two extra sizes that come in the box so you can really get that tight and nice seal you need to really make active noise-cancelling a thing that there's worth $50 you're paying for you know another thing is on the air pods Pro there is some more design changes so on the stem with the regular air pods - there is no masters well there's a little bit of mesh but not enough where you can feel a difference now hair pods Pro takes that up a whole notch there's a full-on strip so adaptive EQ comes on the pros and this is really nice because not only are you getting active noise cancellation your tips for that perfect seal but the pros can actually read your environment and fine tune what that sound is the big thing that I really didn't like about air pods and even the air pods - was having these in on a long flight or just listening to music for a while they really start to get painful and that's just not what you want so with the pros and them just being lighter kind of less large but having this ear tip it just sits on almost the perimeter of your ear but has enough of a seal where it's just it's just less irritable and kind of similar with the whole air pods line in just any Apple accessory the minute you connect it with bluetooth you can jump into the settings menu and really just customize the air pods Pro and one of the new features given that there are silicone tips to really get the personalized feel you're paying fifty extra dollars for is the ear tip fit test so by putting in the air pods Pro in both ears it plays a noise and based on the seal of whatever silicone tip you chose it'll let you know if you have the right fit or if you want to try something else that's pretty cool excited to see how long it takes me to lose these because you have to pay four dollars for the right silicone replacement and I can only imagine Apple giving you just the one pair not all three so that's kind of new with the air pods Pro other than that it's pretty much the same so on the air pods the first gen and the second gen they weren't water resistant but of course with the air pods Pro they have some sort of water resistance of course we need to put this to the test because while Apple's claiming an ipx4 rating that's just basically sweat if you're going to the gym get a little bit of rain on it you should be okay did a water test the extreme water test it's right up there in the iCard or link down below see if these things really were waterproof will we wet in a pool because Apple typically under rates their claims and it's the crazy videos out there that put it to the test and see are they lying or is this something cool now everything between the air pods - in the air pods Pro seem pretty much the same here's what they don't want you to know when you go into settings because you will you have bluetooth paired well on the air pods - you can double tap on the left or right ear pod and you can actually customize Siri next track previous track play pause do whatever you want but on the ear pods Pro because of the force sensor it's not as easy as the air pod to's where you could just tap and just know you're gonna make contact with the promos you have to use your thumb and index finger kind of grip it you just keep it on the end you just squeeze it works so it's a little bit of a learning curve - they sound different we're about to find out the test out three genres got hip hop that's an EDM and then I'm gonna try to find some country and we're gonna start off with the air pods - in my left ear the ear pods Pro in my right ear that's not gonna change but I'm gonna turn off active noise-cancelling and transparency mode so this is just natural this is just straight-up because with battery life I know that was another thing you were wondering about are they different they're the exact same but on the air pods Pro if you are using the active noise-cancelling or noise canceling mode it's gonna take your battery life down around 30 minutes so instead of five hours it's gonna be around four and a half and of course if you pop them in the case should be a full 24 hours alright now the test here we go okay Apple ah I gotta give him a gold star they're not messing around and if you did buy the air pods - you can just breathe a sigh of relief you didn't get home link - they sound the exact same and they should nothing's really different in terms of construction it's just the modes so Rex - the middle sounds good now let's turn on noise cancellation you can hear a difference of course it's based on the ceiling your ear and if you get the right tip but yet it sounds quieter it sounds like a little more intimate the mids and highs just sound balanced the bass is not as overpowering but just not an audiophile but I can just say it sounds more balanced with the pros as you would expect first on the airpot twos it's just loud it's just really loud I don't mind it you might not mind it let's go to EDM got some Griffin in my right body back noise cancellation mode just air pods to being air pods - yeah okay here we go when you listen to a genre like EDM you can clearly hear the difference on the air pots - versus the pros pros are just the balanced performer it is just the player it's there it's showing up to practice it's the first one in and the last one to leave now the air pods - they're in and out you seriously hear the fifty dollar difference maybe it'll go more the more Apple invests hundred dollar difference - $2 difference okay now let's throw it in transparency mode then you got it earpods Pro if you want my love you got my money you got my wallet don't even bring my wall back to me alright that's that's no more let's put some country on now here we go I'm just gonna literally throw on any country just try to get the southern demo and here we are we got Ryan Hertz metonic and the last one from this one it's it's exactly exactly the same it's just more of a balance sound when you have one of the modes enabled otherwise this is exactly like the air pods - so if you own these and you're perfectly happy with how they feel and how they sound do not upgrade at all but maybe you want to spend an extra fifty dollars get what would be not a baby crying on a plane but actually the music you're listening to well apples now got an option and it's not that bad so air pods - or ear pods Pro you let me know in the comments which you're going with this season if you have them or if you want to get them I seriously want to know if this is the $50 decision you have to make where you just already made it that's gonna do it for this one if you guys are new make sure to drop a like and get subscribed a lot more air putts Pro videos coming up so make sure you guys keep it locked and I'll catch you guys next time
