hey what's up guys we have the brand new Samsung Galaxy S 20 and the galaxy s 20 plus right here in the boxes it's time to open the boxes see what's inside and take a first look at the phones so let's get going shall we and the first thing that you notice is the boxes itself there is a slight difference in size of course the smaller s 20 has the smaller box and the box is just the regular black boxes open them up let's see what's inside and let's start with the smaller galaxy s 20 so the first thing that you see when you open up the box is the phone itself you put it to the side and take a detailed look at it in just a minute but stay tuned so let's see what we have inside the box first you have the new super fast charger by Samsung that uses a USB C connection and this one is indeed super fast it features 25 watts of power which will allow your phone to charge up much quicker than before along with it comes a black USB C to USB C connection cables so we're finally in the future with the cable that's also USB C on both ends and since the headphone jack is gone on both the s20 and the S 20 plus NDS 20 ultra for that matter you need to use usb C headphones and in this case you have a pair of AKG tuned USB C headphones with interchangeable tips you have three different tip sizes so that's nice to have what else you have in the box you have user manuals some literature you have a sim tool and no the versions that we got don't come with a case there is no case included in the box so that's a bit of a bummer we would like to see some sort of a basic case just to protect your phone those first few days when you still haven't decided which case you want to buy we have on the side on your main case so to say so that's guys this is the galaxy s 20 let's jump to the galaxy s 20 plus and inside the box of the S 20 plus we have the same package but here the phone that we got is the black version slightly bigger than the s 20 of course and inside the box same things you have the super fast charger 25 watts of power USB C connections and you also have the USB cable included in the box you also have the USBC headphones that go inside your ear they produce very nice sound very balanced without too much bass but still very nicely sounding you have the simple you have some literature and guess about it that concludes the unboxing let's take a look at the phones itself let's first fire up the Galaxy S 20 and as you can see we have this really cool color that this fresh looks very nice we'd like it and the phone itself is refreshingly compact it's very fits very easily in one hand if you can easily use it with just a single hand this is very pocketable so if you want a compact phone the galaxy s 20 is definitely the way to go and let's kill off the protective cover on the back and you have this camera of course on the back as well a triple camera setup more on that enough in a few moments let's also do the same thing for the galaxy s 20 plus peel off the protective cover off the back take a quick look around the phone fire it up and see the interface you have those stunning wallpapers right here you're greeted by the live wallpapers on the body s 20 and the s 20 plus there's a slight difference in display but both these phones are very tiny very compact in size and actually if you compare them to last year's s 10 and s 10 plus they match in size almost exactly what's new here in terms of design you have the punch hole design with the punch hole straight here in the center very discreet very tiny almost bezel as display and as we were using them we accidentally you can touch them with this part of your palm so you definitely be better off using them with a case on in terms of processors the US will get the snapdragon 865 version while the rest of the world is getting the Exynos model with the Exynos 990 chip you have 128 gigs of on-board storage plenty of storage and of course what you are interested in is the cameras and there's a slight difference in the cameras here this one the s 20 plus has a depth sense while the regular has 20 lakhs that but for pretty much everything else these are the exact same cameras they can zoom up to 30 times using digital zoom and the zoom quality looks really good until about the 10x mark it's not quite as good as on the s20 ultra and they cannot quite go as far but still you get more zoom than your average form and that's a nice addition to have we'll be taking a detailed look at both of these phones in an upcoming review you'll see more samples more battery testing and all the rest in our videos my name is Victor this is fallen arena thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Applause] you
