we have here are two amazing budget-friendly mid Rangers on one side we have the Google pixel 3xl a champion and stable while on the other is the newest challenger in the space the Moto just for if you're looking to invest in only one of them then you'll want to keep on watching hey guys it's John be here with phone Reena and this is a quick comparison between the Google pixel three axl and the Moto z4 now depending on your taste you may be swayed by one design more than the other the pixel through a XL is cute and cuddly while the Mersey for flaunts a more industrial look there's no denying the more premium feel the Moto z4 and another noteworthy point is the modular aspect with the vast collection of motor mods that are available for it this combined with its more premium look absolutely gives the Moto z4 the advantage in this round the specs of the two displays aren't too different as the pixel 3 Excel packs a 6 inch OLED display while the Moto C 4 size up with a 6 point 4 inch OLED 1 now both are equally detailed offer exceptional and viewing angles they produce accurate colors and have somewhat similar brightness outputs still we're giving the slight edge to the Moto z4 because it strives for the minimal bezel look and its insulin fingerprint sensor giving it more of that flagship caliber feel Google's clean version of Android is prized among enthusiasts something you'll find with the pixel 3 ax l but you can't count out the mode of z4 either not only because it's close to stop but also for the fact that Moto's experience has continued to be an asset they both offer their own novelties like squeezing the pixel 3a Excel to initiate the active edge function and perhaps even the chopping motion to turn on the LED flash on the Moto Z 4 then again the pixel 3 XL will more than likely be greeted to the latest Android updates first the pixel 3 Axl is powered by the Snapdragon 670 while the Moto z4 features the Snapdragon 675 they're both fluid and responsive when it comes to basic things and synthetic benchmark tests don't cough up any concrete results to determine who is better then again neither handset would be ideal for heavy gaming the motor z4 offers double the storage and 128 gigabytes versus the pixel 3a excels capacity of 64 gigabytes better yet you get expandable storage with the Moto z4 courtesy of its micro SD card slot which isn't something available with the pixel 3 Axl if there's one single thing that these two smartphones have taught us it's that you don't need any fancy dual camera system to produce outstanding photos it was little team excellent results with a single camera you could say a lot of credit can be given to how these cameras are driven by AI and post-processing enhancements after snapping countless photos it's still tough to make a determination in who's the better one generally speaking they both take exceptional looking photos for their price points but if we're to consider the total package we give the pixel 3xl a slight advantage both the cameras handle well it seems but the Moto z4 tends to slightly overexposed while the pixel 3 Axl has a more realistic neutral exposure it's also evident that the pixel 3xl offers the better dynamic range seem that the highlights are better exposed whereas they're blown out with the moto c4 with their respective night modes it's again the pixel 3 Axl that captures our attention for having the better results details seem almost similar with selfies with a slight advantage to the Moto z4 but the pixel three XL selfie camera does a significantly better job with dynamic range for recording video we kept the two phones at 4k Ultra HD at 30 frames per second and just as you expect both phones produce favorable video footage wendel any conditions are ideal although the Moto Z for stabilization appears to be a bit more erratic under low-light situations though they're pretty bad considering the softness and noise in the scenes both smartphones are more than capable to carry on a full day's work load but the Google pixel three Axl just has a little bit more gas left in tank by the day's end also our battery benchmark test shows us that the pixel 3 Axl wins in the longevity department with a mark of 10 hours and 47 minutes in our testing which is now longer than the motor z-force time of 9 hours and 49 minutes when top line smartphones can easily cost a thousand bucks it's refreshing to know that you can still get something decent in the mid-range market for half the price we won't deny that both the Moto z4 and pixel 3 XL are great performing smartphones but they're pricing provides us with some additional insight at the end of the day the price difference between them is a mere $20 if you're looking to pick up the unlock version of the motors e4 it'll cost you 500 bucks and comes included with a 360-degree camera moto mod meanwhile the Google pixel 3 excels $479 costs is pretty good too considering that it's camera is a better performer I'll get rid to those major Android updates faster and it's battery life is longer now making a decision between the two will largely hinge on your desire for those motor mods if adding those features appeals to you then absolutely stick with the Moto z4 on the other hand if you're the kind of person that doesn't plan on buying additional accessories post-purchase then the pixel 3xl may just be your kind of phone and that is it for this video guys to learn more about either handset you can check out our website phone Reno comm is John be signing off [Music]
