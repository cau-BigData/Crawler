this is the sony xperia one the company's latest flagship phone and it's the phone that i've been using for the past several weeks it is a well-built piece of hardware and that 4k OLED screen looks beautiful plus you get a very capable triple camera at the back but is this phone worth the 950 dollar asking price well yes maybe it is let's take a closer look when I showed the Xperia one to a friend the first thing that they said was that it looks just like a typical Sony and that is not incorrect the Xperia brand is known for its straight lines flat surfaces and rectangular shapes but the Xperia 1 is different it is different from any other flagship Android phone and not only with the fact that it doesn't have a notch or a cutout in the display the phone is built around this 6.5 inch screen with a 21-2 9 aspect ratio what this means is that the phone itself is really tall but narrow at the same time it is far from compact but it is relatively easy to hold for something of this size another benefit is that more content can fit in a single screen which is convenient when using apps like Facebook or Twitter the shape of the screen is also ideal for watching white screen movies but with most YouTube videos you get these huge black areas on the side of the display and zooming in Krupps a significant portion of the frame overall the Experian is a solid very well-built phone and I really like how seamlessly the glass surfaces blend with the metal frame what I don't like is the fingerprint reader it is on the right side of the phone and it's just not reliable enough sometimes it works perfectly then five minutes later it takes five attempts to unlock the phone the power button is actually separate not built into the reader for some reason it's okay but it feels a bit tiny something that you don't see often is a dedicated camera button personally I don't use it for taking photos as much as I do for launching the camera without even looking at the phone for this purpose the button is really convenient the display on the Xperia 1 looks gorgeous I am sure that it's 4k resolution has something to do with this even though in normal use I cannot really tell the difference between this display and that on the galaxy s 10 plus next to it I should point out that to save battery the phone only runs at 4k resolution when that makes sense when using the gallery application for example or while watching 4k video on YouTube but color accuracy could be better by default the colors are cold and saturated probably to make the screen draw attention you'll get better colors if you switch to the milk creator mode this mode is meant to deliver more balanced realistic colors the kind of look that you want if you'll be editing pictures or video but for some reason the screen still looks kind of cold even in creator mode so I ended up tweaking the screen even further to make it warmer the Sony Xperia one runs Android 9 pi out-of-the-box and there aren't many surprises with the software it looks and feels similar to what you'd get out of a pixel phone for example and the amount of bloatware is fairly low I really like how fast the software is and perhaps the presence of the powerful Snapdragon 855 chip has something to do with that 6 gigabytes of RAM may seem like a low amount in 2019 but in reality the phone is very responsive you also get cool features like ambient screen which shows you quick status information when you left the phone and Google's digital well being feature which gives you a breakdown of your smartphone usage what I'm not a fan of is the sight sense feature it displays a number of shortcuts when you double tap on the edge of the screen but in my experience it was so unreliable that I quickly turned it off sony says that the screen is ideal for side-by-side multitasking thanks to its shape unfortunately androids split-screen experience is still limited so I rarely use it many apps including Instagram and Facebook Messenger still do not support split-screen and I still cannot have two browser tabs open next to each other the triple camera at the back of the Xperia 1 is the most capable we've ever seen on a Sony smartphone you get a main camera for everyday use a telephoto camera for portraits and two times optical zoom and a super wide angle camera but after several weeks of use I am left with mixed feelings about this camera on one hand the Xperia one takes very natural-looking photos it doesn't over expose images or exaggerate colors like some other cameras do and that's a good thing needless to say the telephoto and the wide-angle cameras are very useful when you want to zoom in on your subject or fit more in the frame without stepping back you get powerful camera tools like full manual controls super slow motion and burst mode for capturing split-second moments unfortunately the camera software is in need of improvement right now on my review unit the camera app is slow and takes forever to display the picture that have just taken low-light photos look okay but they aren't better compared to what you'd get out of another phone that is in this price category and such photos literally require several seconds to capture also what I think is an HDR mode has a very subtle effect on the image so it's common to end up with completely washed out skies in your photos on top of that shooting portraits with background blur can make the camera unresponsive for about four or five seconds and this is just disappointing this is by far the best camera sony has ever delivered and it could be a worthy rival to any galaxy or pixel phone out there it just needs better more reliable software the selfies that have taken with the eight megapixel front camera look ok some of them turned out really good even in challenging light situations just don't expect much when shooting in low-light videos from the Xperia one looked really good and are well stabilized you can zoom in with the telephoto camera while shooting which is useful but you cannot switch to the super wide angle camera if you need to speaking of video the Xperia one comes with a new app by Sony called cinema pro it is made specifically for shooting video with professional controls over the camera settings you may also apply a number of filters to the video to give it the kind of look to fit a certain theme all you know this is an app for people who really know what they're doing it is just too sophisticated for normal people to get the hang of the Xperia one doesn't have a headphone jack but you do get a dongle in the box that plugs into a USB port my review unit also came with a pair of decent wire earphones with a 3.5 millimeter jack at the end the built-in stereo speakers are loud and sound very clear especially in the vocal range they also have good balance so you don't have one speaker sounding much louder than the other one thing that they are missing is bass and yes we know that these are just phone speakers but still rivals like the iPhone 10s and the Galaxy S ten produce more bass with their speakers and now let's talk battery life the Xperia one has a 3300 milliamp hour battery which is one of the smallest on a phone of the size but in practice the phone holds up really well probably because it has great standby time personally I get up to 2 days of use out of it without having to limit its performance of course your mileage may vary especially if you're a heavy gamer I have also noticed that using the camera a lot can drain the battery quickly finally let's try to answer the big question is the Xperia 1 worth getting well the phone has a lot going for it it is well built if he has a great screen and the software is clean and fast but the camera and the fingerprint reader could be so much better but 950 dollars the Xperia 1 will have a hard time selling especially when rivals like the galaxy x10 plus cost just as much but when it launches in the US on July 12th the Expedia one will come bundled with Sony's high-end wireless noise cancelling headphones which alone cost three hundred and fifty dollars and sound really good picking the two together
