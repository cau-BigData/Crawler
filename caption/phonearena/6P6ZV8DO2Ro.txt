hey guys this is Nick with phone arena and for the past 24 hours I've been checking out the new Asus zenfone 6 this is the company's latest Android device and it's a phone that has a lot to offer at a reasonable price Asus promises long battery life fast performance and great photos out of the dual camera system at the back but the first thing that grabs your attention is the display on the zenfone 6 what's curious about it is that it doesn't have a notch and it doesn't have a punch hole camera cutout either it's a big six point four inch IPS LCD display that stretches from one corner to the other there is a small chain at the bottom but it is easy to ignore the screen doesn't quite deliver the contrast and saturation that you would get out of an OLED screen but it is still a good-looking display and it is really great knowing that you can use its entire screen area for playing games or watching video with no distractions getting in the way okay by now you're probably wondering where the front-facing camera is and actually there is none instead when you want to take a selfie or have a video chat the main camera from the back flips 180 degrees and that's what you use it's not a bad concept actually if you think about it the main camera on pretty much any phone is better than the selfie camera so why not use that for selfies but on the other hand I am not entirely convinced that this flip camera module would last a very long time it doesn't feel flimsy or anything it's just that not all people are super careful with their phones not to mention that a few specks of dust or grains of sand can cause all sorts of trouble if they fall inside the mechanism thankfully Asus has taken precautions the camera module will close automatically if it detects that the phone is falling in terms of hardware specs we get the powerful Snapdragon 855 along with up to eight gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage needless to say this is one very capable phone and I've had no issues with its performance so far but I am convinced that the responsiveness has to do a lot with the software as well the Asus zenfone 6 runs Android 9 pi without much bloatware to slow it down in fact this is the cleanest Android interface that Asus has delivered in many years on top of it memory optimizations ensure that apps launch quickly and switching between them happens instantly to be clear asus has changed quite a lot of things along the way but most of the changes are welcome additions such as a dark mode and the gaming mode that lets you record or lifestream your gaming session the interface is also customized to be more accessible with a single hand for instance dialog windows and the contents of folders appear at the bottom so that they're easier to reach we are also glad to hear that Asus is committed to updating the zenfone 6 to Android r when it becomes available of course the dual camera setup is comprised of a 48 megapixel main camera and a 13 megapixel secondary camera with an ultra wide lens I haven't been able to test the camera extensively but what I've seen so far are mixed results you see the camera uses this hdr+ algorithm which is enabled by default and at times it can be just too aggressive giving you flat and unrealistic photos but then you take another photo 5 seconds later and it looks great by the way the camera takes 12 megapixel photos by default you can switch to 48 megapixels to get more detail in your photos but this slows down the camera significantly so I wouldn't recommend it I cannot complain about the quality of selfies however and the wide-angle camera is really nice having when shooting in tight spaces one more thing that I have to mention is that the zenfone 6 has a massive 5,000 milliamp hour battery as a result it is relatively thick and heavy for a phone of the size but the battery just keeps going and going I can easily see this phone lasting 2 days between charges in fact it produced a score of 13 hours and 10 minutes on our battery test which puts it over five hours ahead of the galaxy s 10 plus so this was our quick preview of the Asus zenfone 6 we'll be testing it further over the coming days to give you a fuller in depth review with more impressions of what using a daily feels like stay tuned for that and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already to never miss any of our future videos
