Apple should have released this phone a long long time ago hello guys my name is Vic with fawn arena and this is the new iPhone 11 Pro and this is the larger iPhone 11 Pro max these Falls look just like last year's iPhones and they're just as expensive at a price of more than $1000 but unlike last year's iPhones their batteries won't die on you before you get home and really this is the most profound change in the iPhone series from the very first iPhone yes I'm oversimplifying things there are a lot of new features here that I'll get into shortly but mostly these are just your familiar iPhones that you don't have to carry with a ridiculous battery case on okay I have started talking about battery life so how do you measure it Apple says that on average you get 4 hours extra battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro and 5 hours on the pro max compared to the 10 F series how much is that though oh it's actually a lot on the pro max you can now play video for up to 20 hours which is a third more than what you could before this is a huge jump and in my experience the iPhone 10s that I used last year would often dial me in the afternoon if I use it a bit more with the 11pro that I've been using for a week I can use it all day and come back late at night and still have spare charge of course if you're in non stop playing games it won't last that long but with averages you recover it for even the longest days but enough with the batteries the other thing that you probably care about is cameras let's start with night mold Apple is the last one to bring it Google and Huawei were the first to have it and Samsung has it for more than half a year now but the way Apple does it is different you don't have to remember to switch a separate mode in the camera you don't have to fiddle with anything if it's dark night mode will turn on automatically you just hold your phone steady for a couple of seconds press the shutter button and that's it the photos you get with it well forgive the pun but it's a night and day difference here is how they compare against the pixel or other phones we like the iPhone photos a little bit better the better able to capture the darkness and not make a nice shot appear as if it was shot during the day but also photo quality overall has improved photos are sharper and have a lot more detail the neutral white camera has quickly become one of my most used camera features I like that the colors from it match the colors from other cameras and it works for videos too not everything is great though the front camera does this weird thing that turns your skin into a weird orange color so you look like a pumpkin it's probably some sort of a I think that Apple does and it doesn't happen every time but it does happen it looks really bad and also portrait mode just doesn't seem to improve much over the years especially if you're taking portraits of someone who wears glasses for video you have some great improvements in nighttime video recording you have XDR or extended dynamic range videos which simply means that you get a cleaner picture with more colors and more detail for all else this is an iPhone iOS looks pretty much the same as it did ten years ago only now it has dark mode which turns background in apps to black leaving your eyes less tired when you use your phone at night the iPhone is also increasingly a platform for exclusive services the new app orchid is for example brilliant a five dollar subscription for some truly high-quality mobile games that you can share in the family with other iOS users it's a joy to use but some will say that this iPhone is kind of boring and it's true but also it's not this phone doesn't fold but it is also well built and it will not break it doesn't have a periscope camera but photos it takes look great it doesn't have a high refresh rate screen but it works extremely smoothly and it doesn't have fancy features but it will get updates for probably five years to come and now it has an excellent battery life to the 11pro is beautifully conservative and it's in many ways the most profound change to the iPhone series even though you can't see that on the surface but it's also pure luxury and it costs way too much you really need a telephoto camera in a stainless steel case if you don't and you can live with the slightly bleaker screen of the iPhone 11 then by all means go ahead and buy the cheaper iPhone 11 and save yourself three or four hundred dollars and this is our take on the new iPhone 11 Pro I hope you enjoyed hearing our thoughts on it and if you did don't forget to leave a thumbs up to this video or drop a comment and if you want to see more from us subscribe my name is Vic it was a pleasure talking to you and I'll see you next time right here in fall arena [Music]
