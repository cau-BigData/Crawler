this is the Nokia 5.3 hm these new budget device promising a pure Android one software experience and offering a versatile quad camera setup including an ultra wide lens and a macro one for close-up shots in many ways Nokia 5.3 device expectations for what a budget device can be proving once again that you don't need to be spending $1,000 for a smartphone anymore considering most what's important to you can be found on a sub $300 device like this one hello there I am rather with phone arena and this is our review of the Nokia 5.3 coming in at 185 grams with a plastic back and a gorilla glass front the phone is fairly light but doesn't feel cheap in fact it feels solid and well put together although it looks inspired from behind the circular camera module about the fingerprint sensor add some flair to its appearance on the front a teardrop notch above the display holds its 8 megapixel selfie camera well as much in houses a second Nokia logo the display features rounded corners all around making for an appealing and modern look the Nokia 5.3 is volume and power buttons are positioned on the right side of the device similarly to where they are on most other smartphones but the power button uniquely has an embedded breathing notification light inside of it we on the left side of the phone is a non customizable Google assistant key we would have liked the option to change what it does but currently it can only there trigger Google assistant or you can disable it completely the standard fingerprint sensor available in the back of the phone gets the job done most of the time but not always on the first try as it often fails to recognize the register of fingerprint on the first go forcing you to lift your finger and place it back on it several times until it finally unlocks the phone it does have a bonus feature however you can swipe down on it to bring the notification shade which is cool when it comes to the Nokia 5.3 display it features a 6.5 inch 720p LCD screen and although it's far from the sharpest it does impress with great contrast and high brightness making it visible even in sunlight black shades always look surprisingly solid for an LCD display and colors don't distort when you view the screen from the side especially for its price point the display is very good in most aspects and its ultra white screen 20 by 9 aspect ratio makes this smartphone a good choice for watching movies one downside of screen however is that colors on it have a noticeable blue tint the good news is color temperature can be tweaked in the phone's display settings to remedy that next up let's stop camera a defining feature of the smart phones look is its large camera module on the back containing four cameras in a flash the nokia 5.3 appears to have a great folks from portrait mode photography with portrait shots taken on both his selfie shooter and back cameras often turning out quite impressive with nice blurred backgrounds subjects generally look crisp and sharp as long as there is enough light available in addition to portrait mode the nokia fact when threes camera up includes the night mode for low-light photography which does some post-processing after Apollo is taking boosting his brightness and clarity with good results unlike some other smartphones night mode on the nokia 5.3 is available on both the main and the wide-angle cameras video recording from the main 13 megapixel camera can go up to 4k which is default resolution being 1080p videos come out satisfying it sharp from the main camera but there is no optical image stabilization onboard and footage appears a bit shaky and with occasionally too strong contrast for photos in videos the phone's 5 megapixel ultra wide camera and 3 megapixel macro cameras are also accessible and deliver a nice results even if the ultra white is noticeably softer especially when recording video for media consumption the smartphone has a single bottom firing speaker although it doesn't offer much in terms of base or lower mid-range frequencies the speaker makes up for it by having remarkably high peak loudness and the remaining fairly crisp almost the highest volume levels a welcomed alternative is available to the phone has a headphone jack call quality on the nokia 5.3 is well above average with voices sounding crisp and clear on both ends of the line coming with the Android 1 version of Android 10 and the promise of 111 the nokia 5.3 offers a pure software experience with basically zero bloatware two years of Android updates and three years of monthly security

smoothly at medium settings in addition and retains gesture navigation works great on this device a double tap to wake the screen sure is also available and works reliably as for battery life nokia promises two days of battery life on a single charge and that has proven to be true in our usage thanks to the phones 400 million power battery and lack of bloatware life users can easily get it lasting even longer in our separate benchmark tests the Nokia 5.3 lasted 11 hours and 53 minutes of continuous web browsing 9 hours and 45 minutes of YouTube playback and 7 hours and 25 minutes of 3d gaming on a single charge when it comes to battery life it outperforms the likes of iPhone 11 Pro Galaxy S 10 plus and pixel during a it also charges back a reasonably fast for around 2 hours thanks to the included 10 watt charger in the box so die is the Nokia 5.3 as long as you have reasonable expectations for what is essentially a sub 250 dollar budget device it's quite impressive with a
