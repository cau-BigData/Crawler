when it comes to protecting your iPhone Apple sells a few cases it itself makes and some of them even though expensive feel very well made but I have spent the last few days with the clear case on the iPhone 11 Pro Macs and I'm convinced this is probably the worst case Apple has ever made so much so that I had to make this video hello guys my name is Vic with phone marina and this clear case sells for $40 over typo comm and it's made of plastic it wraps the iPhone from all sides except from the bottom which makes not only access to ports easier but it facilitates the gesture navigation interface the case itself is not flexible at all and it feels very sturdy I don't mind having this tough shell on the back of the phone but the problem is that the plastic is also extremely hard to press at the size of the phone so much so that it takes a conscious effort every time you try to push the power key or the volume keys on your iPhone it's honestly shocking that's such a relatively expensive case made by Apple itself it's just so terrible as something as simple as allowing you to press the physical buttons on the phone but my biggest issue with the clear case it that is also so slippery it feels like it is covered in oil a case should ideally protect the phone and also enhance your grip on the device so that you don't drop it and this one actually makes it feels like you're holding a bar of soap these are the main reasons why I cannot wait to get the iPhone 11 Pro max out of this case and this is why this case gets a solid thumbs down there is a myriad of better made clear cases that similarly allow you to showcase your iPhone without all of those shortcomings I have been quite satisfied to the $20 liquid-crystal case by spigen it looks very similar to this Apple made one but is sold at half the price feels more durable and protective you're still buttons on the sides feel satisfyingly clicky also the spy jung-hwan wraps the phone from all sides including the bottom of course this is just one recommendation and there are plenty of other options you can consider I love the leather cases that Apple makes they're expensive but the leather ages nicely and they feel well made but the clearcase is clearly a failure and you better stay away from it and this is my quick take on this case that I wanted to share with you if you found this video useful smash that thumbs up button subscribe if you want to see more comment if you're using the same case and I will see you in the next one
