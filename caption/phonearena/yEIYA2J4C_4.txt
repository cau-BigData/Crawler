we've all heard it before unplug your device so that it doesn't overcharge or maybe you heard too clear all your apps so that's your battery life lasts longer maybe you've heard even scarier things like that air pods are giving you cancer well smartphones are one of the most widely used electronics in the world so it's no surprise that there's a lot of opinions about how to maintain their health and yours as he use them with that in mind we're going over six of the most common beliefs that people hold under precious Apple devices separating the facts from the fiction first on our list is an oldie but a goodie despite many unequivocal plainly stated answers that echo or resounding no I still see so many people clearing their apps on their phone in hopes of getting better battery life there has not been a more succinct answer on this topic than from Apple's senior VP of software engineering and your friends rich but cool dad Craig federighi answering a customer's email originally intended for Tim Cook mr. Feder review categorically denies any necessity for closing apps no and no from Apple's VP of software engineering is good enough for us but to elaborate just a bit here's why essentially apps that show up in the recent apps are in such low-power States that's a really not impacting battery at all couple this with the fact that you use your phone no matter how light your usage is and next time that one of these apps needs to open either by you or their system is going to use more CPU power and therefore battery power to get these apps open again there are a couple quick caveats to this approach with apps that our background resource heavy like Facebook and other social media closing them without disabling background app refresh won't do you much good also in the case of location tracking apps limiting location services is also advised other privacy features like the iPhone share my location feature is another good one to disable for hanging on to your precious juice other privacy features like Bluetooth sharing may transmit data in the background to other Bluetooth devices such as wearables while the app isn't even open but this should have negligible impact on your battery if you think there's an errant app wreaking havoc on your battery it's relatively easy to manipulate these authorizations firstly you can check an apps background usage from the battery menu in the general settings tap any app in the list to see a breakdown of battery drain due to on-screen time versus background activity next from the privacy menu in the main settings you'll find location services while the rest of these relevant preferences can be found within the app in questions dedicated settings also found in the iPhones general settings menu beware of course not to turn off something like background app refresh on a work communication app that you rely on for up-to-date notifications like slack or if you will use whatsapp to receive phone calls that you need to get even when you're not on Wi-Fi otherwise you can tweak the aforementioned settings to your liking to limit an app's of access to your iPhone's resources or to see if an app is truly running wild oh and of course turning on auto brightness and true tone display are easy ways to keep your battery life usage down without you having to think too much about it lastly you can turn off Wi-Fi when you're on the go so it's not constantly looking for Wi-Fi network and that should save you a little bit of battery as well so to recap don't close your apps rather keep them in check with set it and forget it options within the iPhones menu use auto brightness and turn off Wi-Fi while you're on the go okay this one's kind of true many of us have heard stories about batteries overheating and exploding but barring any serious manufacturing defects this really isn't a consideration when you're trying to decide whether to charge your phone overnight or not batteries can and often do emit some heat when charging so taking off thicker cases and making sure your phone is in a well ventilated area to charge is advisable for the batteries longevity but fortunately not your own plus the iPhone and really every modern phone to have features to prevent overcharging so don't smother it and charge away right well not really while it's not dangerous to charge your phone overnight it is bad for the batteries longevity the first thing to consider here is that rechargeable lithium-ion batteries like those found in the iPhone have lifespans based on zero to 100 discharge cycles that doesn't mean used to charge your phone to 100% and then deplete it to 0% in fact don't what this essentially means is if you let your phone charge to 90% and discharge to 40% then charge it back up to 90 and then back down to 40 and you've completed one full cycle as 100% of the battery has been discharged by this point the next thing to know is that lithium-ion batteries don't like extremes whether that be temperatures or charging capacity Apple lists the iPhones comfort zone from 32 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit the company doesn't have specific recommendations on capacity likely to be as user-friendly as possible but lithium-ion batteries like to stay between 30 and 80 percent about and if you're gonna store it for more than a couple days or a few weeks then you want to store it at 50 percent charge we know batteries are complicated and so is life so as best as you can adhere to these following key points charging your phone overnight isn't dangerous keeping it at zero or 100% for prolonged periods of time can degrade battery life over time if you absolutely must charge it overnight opt to use a slower charger as opposed to the fast charging alternatives lastly try to keep the battery life between 30% and 80% while you're actively using it or if you're going to store it for some time charge it up to 50% and turn it off again none of these are a matter of life and death to you at least but it may be the difference between feeding your batteries cigarettes and cheeseburgers versus salads and chicken breasts for its lifetime okay this one may actually be a matter of life and death while we're on the topic of charging let's talk Apple certified chargers I know it's not a conversation many of you really want to have but trust me it's for your own good this one's pretty simple if it doesn't say made for iPhone iPod or iPad just don't use it the potential harm that this can cause you or your device is just not worth the few bucks that you save or the gas station charger you bought in a pinch obviously if it's an emergency it's an emergency like a real one but otherwise avoid these chargers like the plague Apple certification program helps save you from burning out short-circuiting or otherwise or reparable damaging your iPhone or yourself with faulty Chargers with knockoff chargers things can get dangerous pretty quickly a uk-based non-profit tested 15 on iPhone certified charges and found that out of them 49 had the potential to deliver a lethal shock or start a fire pretty scary stuff if you're not satisfied with Apple's puny 5 watt charger you can step things up to the 12 watt or if you have something newer than the iPhone 8 and you can get faster charging capabilities with a lightning cable 2 USB C and the 18 watt charger you can technically go up to a 30 watt and higher but this won't actually charge your iPhone any quicker the 18 watt whale there's also plenty of third-party options like those from anchor which charge just as fast and offer multiple ports often times in short you can't go wrong with these certified reliable chargers but you can go very wrong with anything not certified technically speaking yes you can get a virus on your iPhone but it's pretty hard and there's really only two ways this can happen either a a malware infected app gets through Apple security measures and is downloaded from the official App Store or B you're on a jailbroken device downloading potentially unsafe apps from an unsecured App Store the former of course is rigorously vetted for such threats but some things have slipped through the cracks it's been years since a major breach like this and iOS being a largely homogenized OS on the platforms and devices on which it's running can push through updates pretty quickly if something similar were to happen again as for jailbroken devices such users forfeit these protections and download apps at their own risk from a clandestine App Store the risks here are pretty obvious what about those pesky pop-ups that you can't seem to get out of for those phishing scams sent their texts or email well either of these quite mitz the definition for a virus and there are some easy ways to avoid these and get out of them for closing pesky pop-ups try closing the web page in Safari are going to setting as Safari clear history and website data and then reopening Safari don't answer or click links from texts or emails especially regarding needing sensitive info like login credentials if you receive an alert from a company you use go to their website directly or call them to verify and resolve the issue lastly always update your device software and apps bug fixes and patches are very important for your device's safety no excuses speaking of excuses this is one of those rumors that just doesn't seem to die Apple's relatively recent admission that they slow down phones via updates to protect them as they age didn't quite help put this hot rumor to rest either especially since Apple was essentially caught in the act rather than making these facts previously known however that admission is a bit different than what some people are alleging you the idea that iPhone slowed down over time makes sense an apple's explanation for making this aging process more gradual and stable also seems pretty logical the assertion that Apple slows down phones or otherwise makes them bug your order to encourage users to install incoming updates or upgrade to the latest iPhone is decidedly more conspiratorial in nature we'll just first say this there is yet to be any certifiable evidence that this is the case secondly we'd love it if OSS could remain stable well beyond their release date without any updates but it's just not very feasible so think of your OS as your immune system and updates as your vaccines without these vaccines your body won't know how to fight off long ago eradicate it or minor threats and in this scenario you have nothing to lose updates are free and iOS devices update lifespan is around four to five years so if you're lucky enough to have a working iPhone by then and it still might be time for you to Marie Kondo that iPhone thank Apple for supporting it so long and throw it in the trash or just put it in a drawer if it still sparks joy I guess if you're noticing bugginess and have some software updates pending here's a couple of things you can do number one run your updates number two and show you have at least a gig or two of space because things can get pretty wonky on your operating system when your device doesn't have any space to work with if you're still having problems you can perform a hard reset on an iPhone 10 or higher by holding down the volume down button and the power button until it resets if you have an iPhone with a home button and hold the home button and the power button and so it resets and if all else fails back up your device through iTunes or your preferred backup method and just factory reset the phone yikes unfortunately this was not so cut and dry for a full analysis on this claim regarding all wireless earphones including air pods check out our full article on this matter but here's the main points air pods and all wireless earphones emit electromagnetic fields just as smartphones and any device with wireless capabilities does including your car radio the US and other regions have upper limit requirements on how much of this energy any given device can let its users absorb this is called the specific absorption rate or SAR Apple's air pods fall under the required SAR limit as they must do to be sold in the US but fundamental issues with how SAR is measured have been raised this isn't apples fault but potentially a flaw and how the measurement was calculated in the first place back in the 1980s there's no data that suggests that wireless earphones like air pods pose a health risk but that largely because such specific studies haven't been done while most scientists agree that prolonged concentrated exposure to EMF can cause cancer and other adverse effects on living cells not all scientists are an agreement that wireless headphones will do this to you so what's the verdict well while Apple's air pods meet US regulations it's hard to say that these and other EMFs like Wi-Fi and radio signals aren't potentially doing damage to us on a daily basis it's also hard to discern at this point what they're eliminating air pods from the equation would make much of a difference considering the many EMFs we encounter on a daily basis still it might not hurt to cut down our wireless earphone use when you can so there you have it answers to some of the most talked-about Apple topics if you still have further questions or myths you'd like us to explore Android or Apple based let us know in the comments below and be sure to check out our full article on this on phone arena comm I'm Corey Gaskin thanks for watching [Music] you
