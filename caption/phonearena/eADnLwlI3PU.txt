hey guys Mick with phone arena here and if you're buying the Galaxy Note 10 to protect that $1,000 investment so here's a quick review of five official cases for the Galaxy Note 10 let's begin with the official leather case that Samsung is offering this is indeed genuine leather a premium material that looks classy and feels nice to the touch although the case provides only moderate protection it is light and not too bulky what I like is that the buttons are still clicky and easy to feel even with the case on on the bottom there is a white cutout that lets me use navigation gestures without issues the biggest drawback of Samsung's official leather case is that it wears out quickly this particular case has been in use for less than a month but it's already showing signs of aging at the corners and that is just from rubbing against the inside of pockets some people do like the way leather ages but I'm not one of them this is Samsung's official rugged case for the Galaxy Note 10.1 and I am confident that it can survive serious drops it is made of plastic mostly but the sides are enforced with this rubbery material what is nice about this case is that it has two built-in kickstand and a kickstand can be great having especially if you watch a lot of video what is not great about this case is that the protective lips around the screen get in the way when I tried to pull down the notifications panel or use the gesture navigation another drawback of this case is that it may not let you use wireless power share to charge other devices wirelessly I was able to charge another phone from the galaxy note 10.1 accessories like the Samsung Galaxy buds next we have the SVU flip cover for the galaxy note 10 and I have mixed feelings about it it is a sophisticated case with a transparent stripe on the side here you can see not only the time date and the battery level of the phone but also icons for pending notifications you can also control music playback swiping to the side reveals a widget with playback buttons but while this case appears to provide great protection for the display of the phone it worries me that it doesn't want to stay completely shut it also makes the phone more difficult to use you just get in the way of everyday things like texting or taking a picture even the simple act of controlling the volume is made frustrating by this case but at least it seems well put together and the material feels nice to the touch this case here is the one I was most curious about it has white LEDs under the surface producing this cool light show making the back of the case resemble a starry night sky or you can replace the light show with an animated icon of course the LEDs will also notify you if you're getting a call or a text message which could be useful there aside the case is slim and light button sports and speakers remain well exposed so they are easy to use one downside I can point out is that the glossy surface of the case collects fingerprints easily you should also know that this is just a lightweight case so do not expect any heavy-duty protection out of it since the case draws power from the phone it does have an effect on battery life but I would say that it is negligible finally this is the official LED wallet case from Samsung it has a slot on the inside for a single credit card or ID however the slot is not big enough to fit two plastic cards at the same time of course the LEDs on the cover are a much more exciting feature they light up to show the time and then a counter for unread text messages when you're getting a call you can pick up or decline with a swipe without having to lift the cover which is nice for some reason the case doesn't show the name of the color it just shows their phone number a way around this limitation is the option to set a custom icon for the people that you talk the most with Samsung also has an app that lets you design your own custom icons unfortunately this case comes with all the downsides of flip covers for example the volume and power buttons on the side are much more difficult to use and taking photos can be reading and again even though your display is fully covered the flip cover doesn't stay closed well and it might just open in midair if you happen to drop the foam thanks for watching our quick review of these five Samsung Galaxy Note 10 cases you can also check us out at phone arena dot-com for the latest mobile tech news and subscribe to our YouTube channel to never miss the video
