hey guys this is Nick with phone arena and you know what I find interesting how some people buy a phone because it has this exact processor or that particular camera and others just buy a phone because it sparkles or something this here is the Asus zenfone 6 and I think it is definitely a phone for the first group of people he has a big screen a giant battery the fast Snapdragon 855 chip and it starts at just $4.99 dollars which is a bargain in 2019 oh and it can also do this so I've been using the zenfone 6 for several weeks now and I would say that it's one of the most unusual phones of the year and I mean this in a good way for example this is one of the few phones that achieved the old screen bezel-less design without the need for a notch in the display the bezels are not exactly razor thin and the chin at the bottom is definitely there but hey we cannot really complain given the price point as you may have noticed there is no front facing camera on this phone when you need to take a selfie the entire camera module flips 180 degrees and that's actually a pretty cool concept you get a 48 megapixel main camera and the 13 megapixel wide-angle camera next to it which is more than enough to take awesome selfies also I had no issues using the flip camera for video calls or in third-party applications what I am worried about is that at the end of the day this is still a mechanical component in theory it can open and close at least a hundred thousand times but in the real world this phone will get dropped and the camera module will get pushed or hit by accident many times so that's one thing to keep in mind oh and even though the camera module closes automatically when the freefall is detected it just isn't fast enough it seems unable to close completely before hitting the floor overall the design of the phone feels very familiar you get a metal frame all around with Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and 3 on the back given the big five thousand milliamp hour battery on the inside it is no surprise that the phone is kind of thick and heavy it feels substantial in the hand the fingerprint scanner is at the back of the phone there is nothing fancy about it it just unlocks the phone and it has been working reliably throughout my testing with the Asus zenfone 6 you get a classic headphone jack and my review unit also came with a basic wired headset in the box I also got a plastic protective case so bonus points go to Asus for this some of you will be happy to know that there is also an LED notification light it is very basic in what it can do but it's better than nothing I suppose what you do not get is water resistance the phone has no IP rating which is kind of expected given the camera mechanism in use the display on the zenfone 6 is actually pretty good though it's not quite perfect it produces sharp details and has good outdoor visibility colours are called and blueish by default but you can fix this by going to the display settings menu and tweaking the display options one minor issue that I want to point out is that the automatic display brightness has been having a hard time adapting to my needs sometimes the screen is too bright at night or too dim in daylight I've been also noticing more instances of accidental tabs around the edges especially while gaming or watching video out of the box the zenfone 6 runs Android 9 pi and Asus has promised to release updates to both Android Q and R when they're available what is good to see is that the software is mostly free of bloatware and gimmicks in fact it looks a lot like what you'd find on a Google pixel or an Android one phone for example you get Google's digital well-being feature that gives you a breakdown of your usage habits you also get Google's night light blue light filter and the option to enable gesture navigation a dark mode is available for those who like how it looks but do not expect it to have any effect on battery life since this here is an LCD screen not on all it because of this you do not get an always-on display either but you can set the zenfone 6 to light up the screen when you receive a notification which can be useful we also see efforts in making single-handed use which easier for example you can pull down your notifications by swiping down on the screen or on the fingerprint scanner at the back also the contents of folders and dialog windows are designed to be closer to the bottom of the screen so that they're easier to reach another welcome addition is the so called smart key out of the box it is configured to launch the Google assistant or your personal updates page if you press it twice however the key can be set to perform different actions if you're not a heavy assistant user for example a single press cancel between loud vibrate and silent modes a double press can activate the flashlight and a long press can take a screenshot unfortunately you cannot set the button to launch an application of your choice on the hardware side of things the Asus zenfone 6 comes in several configurations the base model here 6 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage but models with 8 gigabytes of RAM and 128 or 256 gigs of storage are also available the one that I have here is the 8 + 256 gigabyte model and I cannot really complain about its speed or responsiveness a googol pixel phone could be a bit more fluid with its responsiveness and animations but again this phone here starts at $500 and at this price point this is definitely one of the fastest phones you can get if there is one thing that I want to see Asus improve on with future software updates that would be the camera I know a 48 megapixel camera sounds awesome on paper but the software behind it could be much better you see there is this HDR plus mode that is applied automatically when the camera decides that it is needed and sometimes the photos turn out great but then you take another picture later and it looks flat artificial plucking highlights and vividness under artificial lighting colors might be far from accurate and the lack of optical stabilization results in greater chance of blurry images the wide-angle camera can be super useful in tight spots and I found myself using it frequently on the downside it isn't as sensitive to light as the main one so wide-angle night images look smudgy and lack detail Asus has added a night mode to its camera app basically you hold the phone still for several seconds as it takes multiple exposures of the night scene these are then layered on top of each other and the result is a clearer more detailed image night mode does make a positive difference although it is nowhere near as impressive as Google's night sight on the pixel phones the zenfone 6 can shoot video at up to 4k resolution and 60 frames per second video actually looks really good and the software stabilization keeps the frame super steady now according to its specs page the zenfone 6 comes with stereo speakers one is at the bottom and the other is at the top doubling as the earpiece in practice it is hard to call these stereo speakers because the earpiece is way too quiet to produce a decent stereo effect but at least the bottom firing loudspeaker sounds good enough and finally there is the battery life on the Asus zenfone 6 which in my experience has been excellent on average I get at least two full days of use out of it without any issues there is no wireless charging on this phone but you do get an 18 watt fast charger which can top up an empty battery in about 2 hours in conclusion the Asus zenfone 6 may not be a phone for everyone but it is definitely a phone to recommend to Android enthusiasts it is a fast phone with clean software and great battery life not to mention that the hardware specs will keep this device relevant for at least a couple of years if you only have 500 dollars to spend on a phone the zenfone 6 would be a good choice just be sure to keep that camera module safe from danger thanks for watching guys and do not forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel to never miss any of our future videos [Music]
