this right here is the brand new Samsung Galaxy Z flip a radical new smartphone design a phone that folds in half and becomes much more compact so you can easily carry it in the pocket and just look plain cool with it you can also slap it shut during a call if you want to end the call he's got all of those interesting features but let's unbox it see what's inside the box and the first thing that you notice is the box itself looks very interesting very different you have this cover on top of the box and the Z letter which is stylized very interestingly who take the cover off and we'll open the box itself and the first thing that you notice here in the box is the samsung galaxy z flip itself will power it up and put it to the side and take a closer look at the phone in just a second but first the contents inside the box you have a samsung fast charger and this one it uses a standard USB connection for this you also have a standard USB connection to a USBC cable a black one in this case so this charger is not quite as fast as a 25 watt one that you get with the galaxy s 20 ultra and this here will be a recurring theme many of the tough features that you have on the galaxy s 20 ultra are simply not available on the galaxy z flip keep in mind this is an expensive phone it costs nearly fourteen hundred dollars but Samsung is doing something different here it's selling it on the looks and matches on the specs so let's keep on going with the unboxing shall we the next thing that you have here in the box is a pair of in-ear headphones these are tuned by AKG and they don't sound bad for a pair of free headphones they use the USB C connection for a reason there is no headphone jack on the galaxy z flip you need to use the USB C connection what do you think about the removal of the headphone jack it's something that Samsung does for practically all of its flagship phones in 2020 what else you have in the box you have a very interesting two piece case one piece snaps to the top of the phone and the other snaps to the bottom and it keeps the USB C port open so you can easily charge up the phone now this case is an interesting solution and we're happy that Samsung provides it with this phone because it's made of glass and we all know what happens to glass phones if you happen to drop them we just tried opening the phone with a cool one hand motion just like this flicking our wrist and it slipped out and and we're very happy that the case was on it because it survived otherwise we're not sure if it would have survived yeah I think that you have in the Box is some literature user manuals you have a sim ejector tool and you also have an interesting adapter a USB C 2 standard USB connection that's you can use this if you want to transfer your data or sync up your phone easier and this about everything you get in the box so let's fire up the phone and see what it's all about and here I have it in my hands so it has the case on it it's not too thick but if you fold it like this it becomes quite thick and noticeable in the pocket so even though it has compact size and dimensions just looking at it its thickness alone makes it not quite as comfortable as you might imagine but it's really cool just take a look at how it unfolds you can stay at an angle you can tilt it like this or like that you can even place it on a table it's plain cool the hinge itself Samsung has done some special work on it it uses nylon brushes to keep dust off of the hinge and of course protect the foldable AMOLED screen and in terms of specs you probably already know about the galaxy Z flip it's an extra tall phone so the aspect ratio here is 22 to 9 this is really tall but in fact it's actually pretty good if you're watching Netflix movies or other cinematic stuff filmed in the 21 by 9 aspect ratio it's really close to that so great for watching movies what else you have the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 805 5 plus on the inside this is last year's top Qualcomm chip so it's not quite as fast as the brand new Snapdragon 805 and this is an important distinction because the snapdragon 865 is what allows all of the camera magic on the new galaxy s 20 ultra and you have quite a few camera compromises here so just look at the back unlike the three or four cameras that you get on galaxy s 20 series phones these days this one here only has 2 cameras an ultra wide one and the regular view on so only two cameras you lack the telephoto capabilities you can't quite zoom as long as you can on a galaxy s 20 ultra but you can do something cool here you can open the gallery just like so and for example you can just move between images with a swipe on the bottom screen so the screen kind of separates into two parts and a couple of apps support that but not many quite actually looking at the screen itself it looks beautiful it features lush vivid colors and it also has this crease right in the middle it's not something that will go unnoticed it's definitely there but when you're swiping around on the phone you don't feel it that much definitely it is there but it's not a deal-breaker in any significant way so in terms of other specs you also have 256 gigs of on-board storage which is quite plentiful our mother here features 8 gigabytes of RAM which is quite good as well so this phone is definitely powerful on the side here you have a traditional fingerprint scanner that you can access with your thumb this is not one of those newer ones that are built inside the screen but it works quite well these are at least our first impressions you also have the volume buttons and when you fold when you close the phone like this there is a tiny gap in between the two parts so that's it guys our quick unboxing and first look at the brand new Galaxy Z flip stay tuned for more information about this will be doing camera tests battery comparisons and a lot more in the coming days we hope you enjoyed watching this video let me
