what are the best first-person shooters for Android and iOS hey what's up Internet my name is Vic with fawn arena and today we're taking a look at the 10 best new and free shooter games for your phone so let's get things off with number one Call of Duty mobile over the years there have been numerous copycats trying to bring that Call of Duty feel to mobile devices well the original is now here developed by Tencent and published by Activision Call of Duty mobile doesn't just borrow the aesthetic and level design from the legendary Call of Duty series it manages to capture the high-octane gameplay as well you can jump in a classic domination Search and Destroy team deathmatch or frontline match or you can play in battle royale mode Call of Duty is quickly becoming the most downloaded fps on mobile so you have no trouble finding a match within seconds there is no controller support at the time of making this video but Activision has said that it might add it in the future for the time being rest assured that the touch controls are as smooth and intuitive as they can be number 2 shadow gun legends shadow gun is an FPS franchise specifically for mobile shadow gun Legends is an always online massively multiplayer looter shooter there are tons of missions to complete various side quests pick up a plethora of loot to find and even a PvP mode where you can show off your tweets and a new gun by aiming it at someone's head essentially is the looter shooter itch scratcher for mobile these statics remind us of destiny a lot the gameplay is smooth and the game does support controllers but you can play just fine with touch controls as well next up world war heroes this game kind of reminds us of battlefield 1 with his choice of setting and also its soundtrack people who have mixed opinions on his PvP multiplayer because time to kill is extremely slow enemies usually soak up a full clip before they died you can also find various armored pickups around map to make sure your extra beefy at all times we can say we're friends of the monetization choices in this game consumable items such as grenades and medicals have limited users and if you run out you either need to buy more or just suck it up and play the game without them nevertheless it's a free download and you're given plenty of consumables to start with so if you prefer shooters where you have time to react when someone starts shooting you from the back give this one a go number four comes modern ups this game has a sort of Counter Strike ish feel to it it's a nice shooter with smooth controls and good player population but it also starts you off with a limited supply of nades and meds which you have to buy if you want to restock most of the time you find yourself in simple team deathmatch games nothing objective-based or fancy so it's a quick and easy ways to get some frags in when you have a few minutes to spare number 5 modern combat versus modern combat is a staple FPS franchise for mobile before Activision finally published their version of the original modern combat was the Call of Duty mobile experience to go to this latest installment has a futuristic aesthetic and includes the concept of having different character classes with their own set of skills be it to raise a shield around your allies or be a super fast rushing class this game supports controllers so if you refuse to play a Call of Duty mobile with touch controls because to play modern combat while you wait for Activision to include its own controller support its monetization model will let you experience more of the characters faster if you put money in but you can still enjoy the game if you spend more money on it next world war polygon this shooter is mainly designed around a single-player experience it lets you play through a story campaign an event of the second world war the game's aesthetic is made up of colorful polygon graphics and it's not very hard to play so it's a nice little title to blow some steam with the game does have a PvP mode but our experience with it has been pretty bad so we would recommend you download it for the deathmatch mode not to be outdone by its multiplayer focused competitors this game has loot crate's items and skills to collect jumping to number seven we have that effect to a single-player FPS set on a depressing space station in the distant future this game gives us a lot of doom and dead space vibes though it's not as scary you basically need to fight your way through a horde of zombies and escape the infested space station it can't be that hard right the game plays great with a satisfying gunplay and smooth animations it also supports controllers number 8 after pulse after pulse was among the first shooter games to try and offer console great graphics and gameplay on the phone nowadays it has evolved nicely and has a robust community so you easily find other players to match up against it's a third-person shooter for a change and the controls for both aiming and shooting are quite precise with the right amount of auto aim there to help you fight the touch input there are of course plenty of loot crate's to buy with real world money but the title is enjoyable without spending a dime as well at number 9 we have respawnables this game has a worker too Nash aesthetic reminded us of the good old Team Fortress 2 there are no character classes to be found here though we simply unlock new weapons and gadgets as you grind day and day out there also a ton of cosmetics to dresser characters in the game supports a controller so you don't need to wrestle with the touch controls to give those precise headshots every once in a while there are missions or special events that spice things up a bit and help you earn more in-game cash finally number 10 is danger clothes another shooter with a cartoonish aesthetic Danger Close is pretty simple to play just need to aim at Anatomy and your character will auto fire the animations and controls are very smooth and accurate combined with a pretty tame tempo this game is quite okay to play even without a controller you've got three game modes to pick from the good old team deathmatch a quick skirmish mode where it's every man for himself or the newly added battle royale where it's every man for himself on a bigger map setting up your character for success is key you've got plenty of perks different guns or various items to unlock through the weapon shop don't worry too much about pay to win the girls are level locked so there's no chance for someone to jump in the game and immediately buy the most powerful items and this wraps up our list of the 10 best new and free shooter games for Android and iOS which one is your favorite and why let us know in
