the Motorola Wang Xun comes with a beautiful design features four cameras on the back it features an AMOLED screen and it comes to the super affordable price hello guys my name is Vic with falun Rina and we got to spend some time with this brand new phone here at Evo 2019 in Berlin Germany and these are our first impressions now the first and foremost thing you notice about the Motorola Xoom is that glass finish on the back which is really beautiful and different from most other phones on the market it's a frosted glass finish a matte glass doesn't attract finger prints as easily so it looks clean much cleaner than other glass finishes comes in three different colors all of them look interesting and Motorola says it uses six different layers it's a very complex finish but it looks nice it has a slight gradient to it as well and also on the back you have the camera module bulging out slightly and this one is the highlight of this phone feature is not one not two not three but four different cameras you have the main one you then have an ultra wide camera you also have a 3 x telephoto lens and you can use also a hybrid zoom to get up to 10 times zoom and finally you have a fourth camera which is the the depth camera used for portraits and to get that better bulky for those portrait images the camera obviously is the big focus here motorola says that it has improved it uses pixel binning with combining 4 pixels into one to get more light into the images even at night it also features a dedicated night mode which again allows you to get more light in those darker shots but most of all it has improved in terms of the zoom functionality having that Kleiza man three times optical zoom with optical image stabilization with the dedicated telephoto camera is really something special and then you can use hybrid zoom to get even more up close without losing much in terms of quality either now the other thing that you notice about the motorola wong's zoom is that em logo on the back it actually glows which is really cool and you can basically customize the way it goes in that you get a new notification you have your phone laying on the table face down screen down and this moto logo will light up which is a nice really cool indication that you have a new notification there is no LED light here in the front to notify you instead you have the motor Motorola logo glowing on the back and it also glows when you use the phone you can set this in the settings now interesting thing about the Motorola 1 zoom is that it is actually not an Android 1 phone it features a very clean skin similar to what you get on the Moto G series but it's not an Android 1 phone here you do get the Moto gestures you have a double chop for for the flash you have the twist to quickly start the camera these are really nice gestures nice additions that Motorola brings on top of Android without making it too heavy without slowing down the experience also on the bottom of the phone you find the good old headphone jackets here along with the USB C port so you get both of them and interestingly the loudspeaker is on the top of the phone she has a lot weaker on the top and you have a traditional headphone jack on the bottom of the phone our first impressions are that this phone runs really fast under the hood you have the snapdragon 6 7 v chip which ensures really high-end performance not quite on par with the flagship but again the price also here is lower in terms of screen you have a beautiful AMOLED display here and under the screen you have an optical in screen fingerprint scanner which we didn't get to test but we will definitely do this in our full review that's coming up soon now the display is a Malad it features very lush vivid colors that look good we like this screen at first sight you can also select between three different color settings and we use the vivid one what else it's a 60 Hertz display no fence in 90 Hertz here in terms of storage you get 128 gigabytes onboard which is plenty and this will be there will be only one version of the Motorola 1 zoom this 128 gig storage is also expandable via microSD cards the other good news about the Motorola 1 zoom is the battery size which is 40 milliamp hours really solid battery size so we expect to get a solid one plus day performance out of this form the Motorola wanna zoom is coming to Europe and the United States starting on September 5th for a price of around four hundred and thirty dollars which is very aggressive very competitive it undercuts devices like the oneplus 7 pro obviously it's not quite flagship grade but you get great camera features which is the focus of the Motorola Xoom you get the big battery the clean Android experience and of course you have this beautiful frosted glass design let me know what you think about this phone in the comments to this video it was a pleasure talking to you my name is Vic with fawn arena I'll talk to you next one and
