in the past couple of years there was probably no other group of people more neglected by the smartphone industry then those who wanted a phone that is small yet good not handicapped by subpar chips and cameras hi everyone my name is Vic Christophe with phone arena and I am one of those that felt neglected these past few years until about now this year Samsung aims to finally deliver to this neglected crowd with a compact super phone that makes no compromises it has topknot specs camera and performance this compact super phone is the brand new Galaxy S 10 II and while we're not yet sure what the e stands for Samsung says this phone is built for those who want all the premium essentials so yes e stands for essential after all so where exactly does yes then II fit in terms of size and isn't it too small now here's how it breaks down this new Galaxy is not quite as tiny as an iPhone se but it is almost exactly as big as an iPhone 10s or a Google pixel 3 so no the s 'tony is definitely not too small for comfortable use now it also has the design and styling of its more expensive as ten siblings with a similar premium glass and metal construction and tiny bezels one different thing is the flat screen which actually reduces accidental touches and is definitely not a bad thing with the estin II you also get to ip68 water in this protection as well as familiar Samsung staples like a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a micro SD card slot now speaking of the headphone jack the AKG tuned headphones that come for free with the Galaxy S Danny looks stylish and sits very comfortably in the year plus they sound quite good for a pair of free headphones what's also making a comeback is the Bigsby button we still don't understand why Samsung insists on having a separate Bigsby button despite the overwhelming consensus that Bigsby is neither as good nor as fast as say the Google assistant if you're not using Bigsby though this time around you can actually turn this button into something useful and settings you can change this button to start your favourite app and I have set the stove on Spotify for instance this makes it finally useful the more interesting thing however is the fingerprint scanner it's built in the HOME key on the right so it's a regular one no fancy ultrasonic technology here and since this button is a bit narrow though I have noticed that I get more faulty readings than usual especially when I use the phone with a case so it's not quite perfect but still it works fine most of the time as I was using the s10 I was wondering these days what is more important for me in the phone weather is the camera or the great battery life with these cells at the back of my head I'll just scrolling around and suddenly struck me that there was one thing that did not fail to impress me every single time I unlocked this phone and it was neither the camera nor the battery life it was the screen the 5.8 inch dynamic AMOLED on the galaxy s 'tony is such an incredibly rich and good-looking display that it alone is a good enough reason to buy this phone and just admire the colours it's a 1080p panel in case you're wondering and at the smaller screen size you don't need a higher resolution everything is perfectly sharp the contrast the deep blacks the viewing angles everything is excellent and what about the punch hole camera well it's tinier than a notch so it's less of a distraction but it's still definitely noticeable you can also mask it in settings but that creates an artificial big bezel at the top of the phone and seems to make matters worse not better and at the end of the day the punch hole camera is just another big deal it's something that you get used to and move on Samsung's TouchWiz or one UI as the company calls it these days has its reputation preceding it and not in a good way but these days Samsung's interface has improved a great deal Koller the endless technical options and menus have now moved to the bottom of the screen or you can easily reach them one of the biggest new features in one UI our navigation gestures navigation gestures are not enabled by default then you need to manually enable them but it's worth at least giving them a shot they are a bit cluttered especially on this here small screen s10 II but you get used to it now don't forget the swipe up and hold from the centre is the gesture to start the Google assist you can also find more useful tips and tricks in our video that is link to the description below and what about speed and performance here's the deal yes then e is lightning fast but it is not smooth this is an important and a subtle distinction and has to do with animations and transitions and the feeling of using a phone something that those who are looking at benchmarks only will not understand and well specs don't always tell the whole story when it comes to storage what they do and here is that story you have 128 gigs of on-board storage double that of last year's galaxies and double that of iPhone rivals you might not appreciate this extra storage on day one but you definitely will appreciate it in a few months or after year after you buy the phone samsung also keeps the micro SD card slot here which is an easy way to expand the storage even further should you run out the Galaxy S Denis comes with two cameras on the back and one at the front but hard the photo is really great and is it better than the galaxy s 9 the answer to that first question is yes the answer to the second question is not really much better in terms of pure quality but that wide-angle camera is indeed a very welcome addition even though we have no telephoto camera on the SME you can still take live focus portrait shots using the main camera these are not good most of the time and the effect also detects people easily in low-light too there are also a few new ways to blur the background and these can be fun as well there are some great new video features on the SME the biggest one is probably the new super steady mode which you enable by tapping the wavy hand icon at the top corner in the camera app now this only works for 1080p videos but it truly truly makes some magic happen then you get impressively smooth footage almost as if you were using a gimbal it's that good of course for K 60 and 40 30 modes are both available and for the first time on a galaxy there is no time limit for these videos in terms of sound you have two loudspeakers on yes one at the bottom and another one embedded in the year piece and considering how small this fullness we were really blown away with the quality of the loudspeakers first sound gets very loud without too much distortion and second you have very clear and crisp mid-tones and highs and vocals and when it comes to call quality we've also had zero issues with the SME voices sound very loud and very clear with the natural ring to them and the mic also produces a clear and crisp sound for your colors on the other end of the line with a thirty-one hundred million power battery on board the s and E has the smallest battery cell of all new s10 models so how is the actual battery life our real life experience shows that this phone will definitely last you a full day even if it's a longer one and you should not be worried about the smaller battery size Samsung also provides a 15 watt fast charger in the box and it fully recharges the phone in less than an hour and a half you also have support for fast wireless charging which is a nice extra but the truly novel thing here is the support for reverse charging which allows your phone itself to act as the wireless charger this is a clever way to charge up accessories like the new galaxy bus or this galaxy watch active but if you try to charge another phone you will see how your battery drains way too quickly so maybe that's not a good idea now finally at the price of $750 the Galaxy S Denis is definitely not an affordable phone by any means it's merely less expensive than the ultra premium flagships that have flooded the market recently good news is that D use are available from day one and for those who want a compact phone that is great and pretty much every aspect the Galaxy S tourney is a phone that you see and say finally finally a no compromise compact Android phone sure it has its flaws Bigsby the slightly awkward fingerprint scanner the not quite best ever camera but those are just the proverbial fly in the ointment the Galaxy S 10 is a great phone and guests are our two thumbs up if you
