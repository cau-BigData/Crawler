this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and following the disaster of last year's Note seven recall this phone's looking to win back the hearts and minds of smartphone shoppers with an all-new ultra wide screen infinity display best-in-class processor and upgrade to six gigs of ram the node 8 was already looking like a worthy successor but for samsung to then double down on camera hardware pairing its 12 megapixel main camera with a new 12 megapixel zoom lens well is it finally ok to start being excited about Note Hardware again I'm Steven shank with phone Arina bringing you a full rundown on this powerhouse phablet as I review the Galaxy Note 8 this year Samsung has got a bold new look for its Galaxy flagships as revealed five months ago with a launch of the Galaxy S a and s8 Plus this sleek ultra wide screen tall shape was an intriguing look then but the bigger Samsung makes it the more eye-catching it seems to get the Galaxy Note 8 is mostly built from that same mold and the departure from the notes we had just a few years ago couldn't be more pronounced the note 8 isn't just a big galaxy s 8 or slightly bigger s 8 plus and Samsung's already learning to refine this new phone design while the basic layout is the same as the GS 8 with face-filling display Hardware fix P button and a new rear location for the phone's fingerprint scanner the note 8 is a slightly more squared-off boxier looking phone with a new corner shape that really helps emphasize just how narrow and tall this handset is and while it's absolutely a big phone it's still impressive that Samsung is managed to squeeze in a six point three inch screen while the note it is understandably a bit thicker than its gs8 brothers making a room for the S Pen Stylus it's not objectionably so coming in at eight point six millimeters and though this is a heavier handset weighting a little under 200 grams that only helps the noh8 feel really solid and adds the perception of durability speaking of that just like the ill-fated note 7 the note 8 enjoys an ip68 rating for exceptional water resistance that includes the S Pen as well as the handset itself so there's no reason to worry about exposing any of this hardware to water and that even includes full-on submersion like the galaxy s 8 the note 8 has a quad HD plus infinity display with curved edges that's nothing less than impressive in just how much of the phone's face it covers there's room at the top for cameras and sensors and a matching stripe at the bottom for symmetry but Samsung's flagship SAR really something to feel like they're all screen image quality here is really nice and Samsung gives the note eight tons of control for tweaking output to your liking you can get those super saturated AMOLED colors that make everything pop go for a basic mode that deliver some impressively accurate color reproduction or dial things into nearly anywhere in between while it is bright and colorful we've got to knock the notate screen a little for less than stellar brightness manual modes got a low maximum output and even an auto the note 8's not so bright that you can count an easy readability in bright sunlight depending on where you pick up your Galaxy Note 8 you'll find the phone either running Samsung's own Exynos 88-90 5 chip or like the one you see here a Snapdragon 835 those are both some of the fastest mobile processors around and by stepping RAM up from 4 to 6 gigabytes Samsung gives the Note 8 a solidly powerful engine about what you can run any software you throw at it it's not the very fastest Android we've ever evaluated but it's up there near the top and though the extra RAM probably plays a part in helping the phone edge pass the rest of the pack bear in mind that we're only looking at a less than 10% performance improvement over the Galaxy s8 like that phone Samsung is once again giving users boatloads of storage with the node eight equipping the phablet with a minimum of 64 gigabytes and as much as 256 gigs internationally and even if you can't buy that Edition you could always pop in a microSD card to add extra capacity the samsu experience we got to know in the Galaxy s8 is back and that's a good thing with an attractive powerful UI better still things that weren't quite ready when that phone went up for sale like Samsung's bixby personal assistant in a specially bixby voice have become much more accessible and fleshed out by now so using the note 8 out of the box presents a more satisfying software experience as a curved screen phone Samsung's edge panels returned full of customisable options and from apps shortcuts to news and weather a lot of this is legitimately useful stuff one we really like is app pair though to set up a single button shortcut to launching two apps at once and multi window that doesn't sound like much but it really does make the feature more accessible and encourages regular use of course a big part of Samsung's interface here concerns the S Pen Stylus which returns this year much the same as we saw on the note 7 with minor upgrades like a refined tip that brings back familiar features like smart select or screen off memos while also introducing new ones including integration with fix beat you can hover the pan on screen elements to select them then use Bixby's image analysis tools to search for similar pics or look up products online we really like all the security options from a simple pin to iris scanning which seems to even work a little better here than it did on the Galaxy s8 but if you prefer a quick straightforward fingerprint scan the note 8 can take some getting used to there's the same rear placement samsung introduced earlier this year a necessary consequence of the big infinity display but by keeping it with the phone's camera Hardware rather than sliding it further down the handsets back it's a bit of a pain to reach if you're used to holding your phone with its corner perched right under your thumb you're probably gonna have to shift your grip to stretch all the way up as we only expect from Samsung connectivity options are solid on the wired front the USB type-c port introduced with the note 7 is back and with support from all the big US carriers you're not gonna have any trouble on the wireless front either if you still make all the voice calls you'll be pleased to know that call quality is pretty nice here and while phablets aren't necessarily always the most convenient phones to use for such tasks the shape of the note 8 with its relatively narrow body is actually more comfortable for calls than most maybe the biggest headline for the Galaxy Note 8 is the arrival of dual rear cameras a first for Samsung the phone is equipped with 112 megapixel wide-angle camera though its field of view is closer to standard than wide an hour book as well as a new 12 megapixel telephoto camera that effectively gives the phone a 2 time zoom we really like seeing how both these cameras get optical stabilization but it's worth remembering that the wide-angle lens has a much larger F 1.7 aperture than the telephotos F 2 point for making the former a little more ideal for low-light shots speaking of which from low-light performance to shooting under the bright Sun the cameras in the note 8 delivers some really consistently nice-looking pics from Samsung that's to be expected but it's also good to see that this new experiment doesn't break any of the company's existing habits the dual cameras bring with them expected features like a blurred background bouquet mode called live focus which also allows for after the fact adjustment video performances nice and solid too with filming resolutions extending to Ultra HD 4k and even offering a super wide screen version of 1080p for content ideal to fit the note eights unusual screen shape extras like Auto HDR and subject tracking autofocus are available in some of the less high-end modes but even shooting in 4k they can exhibits some exceptionally fast refocus feeds and just like you can switch between wide and telephoto views with a tap and still picks you can jump between cameras in the middle of filming for the vast majority of available modes when you're watching those videos you shot or just streaming some remote content the note eights a solid media consumption machine helped out a lot by its big colorful display we don't love how brightness falls off as a screen curbs away at the edges but everything else looks great sound is decent too not the best we've heard and more than acceptable allowed we'd still kill for stereo but instead get a single bottom mounted speaker like the Galaxy s8 Samsung includes some AKG earbuds with a note 8 they're attractive with a nicely braided cable sheath and the included assortment of alternate tip should mean you get a good fit out of them that might not compare that favorably to your favorite third-party earbuds but they're still better than what you get with a lot of phones the note 8 picks up a 3300 milliamp hour battery smaller than we had in the note 7 but then again the less this battery has in common with that one the better while the 6.3 inch screen consumes a fair amount of juice even when run below its full resolution as the phone defaults to savings elsewhere like in the power-efficient 10 nanometer processor help offset that to some extent in the end battery life is largely comparable to the Galaxy sa or s8 plus with the phone getting just under 8 hours of screen on time in our custom endurance tests recharge times are in the same ballpark too but slightly higher here a little over an hour and a half there's also healthy support for wireless charging if you want to take advantage of that maybe more than anything the Galaxy Note 8 helps assure us that Samsung hasn't left the note 7 through this series off course and the note 8 is exactly the phone that it should be it takes what we liked about the Galaxy s8 brings back the familiar s-pen and even tosses in a couple cool new features well this is largely a well executed new phone it feels like Samsung still getting the hang of this new handset shape it's ultra wide screen infinity display demands and things like that even harder to reach fingerprint sensor a testament to that but it's still a very cool looking phone and the shape helps more than it hurts perhaps the biggest problem is pricing and depending on the carrier you go with you could get paying north of 950 dollars for the note 8 it is a very good phone but not everyone's gonna feel like it's worth $200 more that we'd pay for the Galaxy s8 if you absolutely love having a big screen the s-pen and the ability to take telephoto zoom photos then no date makes sense but it's also far from the best smartphone value around and you're definitely paying a big premium for those extras I'm Steven shank with phone arena thanks for watching and be sure to subscribe so you don't miss any upcoming
