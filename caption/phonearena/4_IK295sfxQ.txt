the webcam on your laptop can take better pictures than this phone and it had so little memory that it could only hold to mp3 songs but back in 2004 nobody cared so this Motorola flip phone became the hottest in the world in fact Motorola is about to release a modern foldable Android smartphone with design inspired by this very model so 15 years later let's take a nostalgic look at the first razor phone the Motorola RAZR v3 back in 2004 the average person had a simple cell phone with a smallish display and a numeric keypad mobile data was still slow and very limited so all that most people needed was a phone for calling and texting at the same time the typical cell phone looked as if it was designed by an engineer not by a designer there were these thick chunky pieces of grey plastic and some even had antennas sticking out of them then came the Motorola RAZR v3 and wowed everyone with its futuristic design it was the thinnest cell phone in the world of course the thickness of half an inch will impress and no one today but 15 years ago it was mind-blowing how thin the RAZR v3 was and it really felt like a premium phone at a time when most phones were made of grey plastic the RAZR v3 was made of metals like aluminium and magnesium a key feature was the keypad which had this cool electroluminescent blue backlight it was unlike anything we had seen before it was practically a piece of art inspired by tech the RAZR v3 wasn't cheap actually at the time of its release it was one of the most expensive cell phones in the world so you would only see one in the hands of rich people but this order of luxury and exclusivity made it even more desirable naturally its price fell in the coming months and years so over the four-year run of this model motorola salt 130 million units showing us how much of an impact a product's design could have on consumers okay by this point you might be wondering what the reason VT was actually capable of well in many ways it wasn't as advanced as other cellphones at the time on one hand the main 2.2 inch screen was very good-looking back then you got several games out of the box and you could even download new ones the speaker was pretty good and you could even get fancy mp3 link tones surprisingly I was even able to get a web browser up and running if you are patient you can still load parts of modern web pages like images and text on the other hand the v3 only had seven megabytes of storage there is seven megabytes and there was no way of expanding it we only got a micro SD card slot with later models the camera hit a resolution of 0.3 megapixels and photos didn't look great even back in 2004 but again none of that mattered back in 2004 all phones took bad pictures all phones had just a few megabytes of memory and nobody in their right mind would want to watch a movie on a 2 inch cell phone display oh shut up would its outstanding design the RAZR v3 resonated with people at an emotional level it wasn't just a tool for calling and texting it was a status symbol and that's what made it so successful on November 13th motorola is expected to announce a foldable Android phone with design inspired by the RAZR v3 to me it looks like Motorola is trying to replicate the formula that made the v3 such a successful product just think about it every phone today looks pretty much the same so a foldable razor phone will draw people's attention but $1,500 the foldable razor is unlikely to become a hit but I believe it's real purpose is to get people talking about Motorola again not to make money thanks for watching our quick look at the original RAZR v3 from 2004 be sure to check us out at phone arena where we'll be covering the announcement of the 2019 foldable razor on November 30 and be sure to subscribe to our channel to never miss a video [Music]
