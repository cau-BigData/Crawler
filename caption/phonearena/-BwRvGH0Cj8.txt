the new Samsung Galaxy watch active 2 is now here and it works with both iPhones and Android phones and it offers most of the features of the Apple ward series five for hundred dollars less but what are the difference between the two and which one should you go for hi guys my name is Willie with phone Arina and both these watches come in two sizes you have a smaller 40 millimeter version and a larger 44 millimeter version and the larger one on both is not gigantic it's moderately large the cheaper base models of both are made of aluminium and you also have more premium stainless steel versions and then the Apple watch also comes in even price here at titanium party or even a ceramic one if you're ready to spend more than a thousand dollars on a smart watch we have the aluminium models here and both retain their good looks even with a lot of use so no worries on that front for navigation the galaxy watch active to no longer has the signature rotating bezel SRI navigate with taps swipes and a new software trick called touch peso where you run your finger over the edge of the watch disseminate a physical rotating bezel the Apple watch on its part features the touch screen but also the digital crown for scrolling longer lists for shops we have a standard quick release system so it's extremely easy to change your strap to a different one well the Apple watch uses its own proprietary system with the pricey bands but it's the advantage of being extremely easy to swap straps you just push a button and slide the straps in and out in terms of actual watch faces both watches support always-on display and then you have 15 pre-loaded watch faces on the Galaxy watch and they will cover most of your needs plus you can customize them with a long press and out complications the Apple watch on the other hand it is on the other hand actually you know the Apple watch on the other hand has even more first-party watch faces and it has the big advantage that it's so easy to switch between watch faces you just swipe from the side for the next watch face the watch faces are also a bit more refined you can add up to nine complications on the infograph faces and you just don't have a face with so much information on the galaxy watch Apple however still doesn't allow for third party watch faces while Samsung supports a lot of these and you can even create a watch face yourself via apps speaking of apps this is an area where the Apple watch has the advanced we have a mini app store right on your watch so you can even download apps without ever opening your phone you can also install apps on the galaxy and there are a few nice ones but the choice and quality of apps overall is in favor of the Apple watch you can also control both watches with voice you double press the HOME key on the Galaxy watch to stop bigsby any long hold the digital crown on the Apple watch to invoke Siri to compare the two we try different commands from a simple weather request that Bixby inexplicably failed to trivia questions the Bigsby cannot answer at all Sirius clearly faster and more knowledgeable and actually useful the one thing we found that fix P was useful for is set reminders and alarms but for all else it was not as much use one smaller detail we noticed is that the Apple watch gives a very nice and gentle tap on your wrist for notifications and when it needs to get your attention while the vibration on the Galaxy watch active doesn't feel nowhere nearly as nice so what about the health and fitness tracking both watches have their own systems the Apple watch has the three rings that you aim to fill every day and the galaxy watches something similar and both will tell you to get up and moving if you sit for too long we found that automatic workout detection works better on the galaxy watch it takes around 10 minutes of the workout any tracks a workout while on the Apple watch automatic workout detection doesn't really work that well and you need to manually start a workout every time you also have automatic sleep tracking on the Galaxy watch a feature completely absent to the series 5 well on the Galaxy you see a nice breakdown of your deep sleep times and overall quality of sleep next up battery life and the galaxy is the winner here it ends a typical day where there are 50% on the battery meter and wearing it over night drains just 5% battery while the Apple watch would end the day with around 35% on the battery meter and it would drain a lot more if you wear it overnight the result of this is that the Apple watch Series 5 needs to be charged every night both the galaxy watch feels like a 2-day watch finally we should talk prices the galaxy watch runs around three hundred dollars while the Apple watch starts at four hundred and can go all the way up to more than a thousand dollars for the ceramic model at the end of the day we feel like the Apple watch is still more refined watch it runs faster it watch faces are better you have more abs and it besides nicely with the Apple ecosystem but if you want a verse that I wash that would work with both Android and iOS that can actually last you for two days and you can use for sleep tracking the Galaxy watch is a very good alternative and this wraps up for our comparison between two of the best smartwatches around don't forget to drop a like subscribe to
