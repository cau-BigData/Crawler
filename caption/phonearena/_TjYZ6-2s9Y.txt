the iPad OS is still very much iOS 13 however it has a bunch of productivity features and improvement so Apple felt it was appropriate to give it a different name the first developer beta is up and we had a chance to play around with it now this is a super early build the first public beta which should be out in a month to probably have more features and more polished but for now here's a preview of what's to come of course the big new addition and the most obvious one we get dark mode in iPad OS which was just like on iOS 13 Apple has finally reduced the empty spaces on the home screen to instead of a five by four grid which we had before we now have a six by five one that's ten more apps that you can fit on a single homescreen and it's definitely a welcome update especially for those that have the extra-large 2.9 inch iPad pro units the today view has been slightly updated now when you swipe right you don't travel to a whole other screen that's dedicated solely to your widgets instead your app grid gets even more compressed and you have your favorite widgets right here on the left ready to give you at a glance information you can set this to always-on so your primary home screen would always look like that finally after years of waiting Apple has finally redesigned the volume icon it no longer popped pops up right smack in the middle of the screen separating you between you and your content now is this little discreet bar on the top of the screen is very much appreciated slide over and split view are getting another rework making them much more useful for multitasking now we can have multiple apps ready to go in slide over mode to switch between them you can just swipe on the bottom bar here or lift it up and enter this mini multitasking for all available side slide over apps now you can have multiple documents from the same app open in split view mode so we can have two notes from the Notes app side side by side or you can grab this one go into multitasking open your email and just drop it here as you can see multitasking is a lot fluid and there are tons more options available to keep track of everything you're doing with an app you can just happen hold on this icon and you get this new option called show all windows Apple calls it the app expose here you can see all the windows slide over and split view combinations that are using this particular app now grabbing your text cursor and dragging it around is much easier and now feels very natural also marching words is less cumbersome just mark one word like this and then just drag the handle moves freely without getting stuck on random lines of text like it used to and it generally feels much easier also if you want to grab a whole sentence just triple tap or tap four times to mark the whole paragraph we can also copy text by pinching in with three fingers and paste it by pinching out with three fingers swipe left with three fingers to undo and right to redo and you will notice we can finally interact with the scroll bar in the right we can drag it up and down for faster scrolling and really long documents now if you need to do some one-handed typing or you want to enjoy the swipe typing that the iPhone is going to get with iOS 13 you can shrink the keyboard by pinching it like so now you can position this small keyboard any way you like and use it for swipe typing with just one finger pinch it out to get the big one back up right here we can see the new Photos app which has gotten a slight facelift we've got curation by time periods here or we can just view them as a good old list of photos and we also have a choice to view the pictures as squares or direct show aspect ratio and of course just like an iOS 13 the coolest things happen behind the scenes photos will automatically hide screenshots or duplicate pictures for you and your screen recordings will be tucked in their own album as well reducing clutter in your main photo feed we've got updated reminders and notes apps we can now share whole folders or specific notes with other people so you can all work on the same document in real time multiple document selection has also been made easier across various apps just tap with two fingers and slide along the list of files these were just some of the bigger changes that are coming with iPad OS there are still new features to come that we didn't get to check out for example the reworked files app which is still not ready in this first beta but this early sneak peek makes us excited for what the iPad OS could become and we can't wait to check out more as the beta updates roll by thanks for watching this subscribe to see even more and I'll talk to you next time right here on phone arena [Music]
