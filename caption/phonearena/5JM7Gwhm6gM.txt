back in 2019 we got the pixel 3a and 3a Excel to afford the ball and arguably better versions of the flagship pixel 3 Series your plastic weren't as expensive and most importantly had the same exceptional camera our expectations are that Google will do the same thing in 2020 and follow up its flagship pixel 4 series with the pixel for a and for a excel so what would those phones look like my name is Vic Kristoff and this is everything you need to know about the pixel for a series no surprises here we expect the pixel for a to keep the same general design of the existing premium pixel for lineup but with two important differences first of all instead of glass we're most certainly getting plastic phones would a few premium no is it a big problem once again no plus you won't need to worry too much if you drop your phone the plastic might scratch a bit but it will not shatter like glass secondly those complicated motion sense radar system and facial recognition sensors of the pixel for could be ditched in favor of punch hole camera positioned in the top left corner of the display this would make the pixel for a and for a Excel Google's first fall's with such a design the three a series used to have quite thick top and bottom bezels so it's a nice touch to see Google adopting a more modern look another important thing to consider is that the pixel for a and for Axl are quite likely getting those good old headphone jacks this was the big surprise with the pixel 3 a series which was the first Google phone to support the headphone jack that has been an extinction mode since well the original pixels the displays will likely remain all LED ones with a full HD plus resolution without that Google will include the 90 Hurst display refresh rate option as it is still a rather premium feature which doesn't really correspond with the more affordable pixel a series performance is another area where the pixel for a family will cut a bit compared to the flagship 4 Series it's expected to use a lower tier chipset and not the snapdragon 8 five this power is the pixel for devices as a reminder the pixel three a came with a Snapdragon 670 processor and four gigs of RAM so we expect the pixel for a series powered by a chipset of the same grape prime candidates are the Snapdragon 730 or 7:30 G or the snapper has seven six five and it's G version storage wise 64 gigs is the minimum we expect to see but even that would be a bit underwhelming and it will be very nice if Google includes 128 gigs up native storage on the topic of cameras the bread and butter of pixels will get just a different look to the camera module but not an actual dual camera setup like we have on the pixel for what will be missing then is the telephoto lens that allows you to get cleaner pictures when you zoom in and you'll likely not have that option on the new for a series this is hardly a deal-breaker though and the nitesite feature that gives you usable images with the main camera when life is super low will still be present and we hope the new astrophotography tricks will be on deck as well finally it's time to address the pricing and the release date of the pixel for a and for Axl now the original pixel 3 a started at 400 dollars while the pixel 3 Axl cost 480 dollars at launch we expect Google doesn't stray away from this pricing even with the moderate updates the pixel for AAA should in for Axl should remain in the same price range in fact with just a few compromises the pixel for a series might be the fully recommend even over the flagship pixel 4 series because it's such a great value for the money in terms of release date the new for a series will most likely get unveiled before the upcoming Google i/o 2020 death summits sometimes in May of 2020 we expect the pixel for pixel for a to be available across all major US carriers as well as in all markets where the Google store sells devices so should you hold your breath for the Fourier series the main thing in them seems to be the new modern design well for all else it look like an iterative upgrade over the 3 a series which are already excellent he'll now dropped in price so this wraps up our early look at the leaks in rumors about the pixel for a series let me know what you think about these falls in the comments right below are you excited about them do you like the pixel a series of devices let me know don't forget to hit that like button if you enjoyed watching this subscribe to our Channel phone arena for more my name is Vic and I will see you in the next one
