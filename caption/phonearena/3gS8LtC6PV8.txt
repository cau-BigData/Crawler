Happo has just dropped his new ipad pro models for 2020 and boy they are hot we get war power on tap and upgraded camera that shouldn't even be on the tablet and some more changes that are not all that obvious so what's new with the iPad pro and should you buy this one or get an older model let's take a deeper look the new ipad pro's come with a new Apple a 12c Bionic processor advertises it is more powerful than most Windows laptops so while we don't have exact benchmark numbers yet if you consider an average laptop having an Intel i5 core chip this one should be more powerful impressive for an ARM chip Apple has also given the graphics processor a big boost with an 8 core GPU thanks to an improved thermal design you will get longer sustained speeds for intensive tasks like 4k video editing 3d design and aar what should really piqued your interest with the new iPad is the internal memory though the entry-level age from the dollar iPad pro comes with 128 gigabytes of storage which is great not only that but upgrading to the next 256 gig model will only cost you an extra hundred dollars so if you have your mind set on an iPad pro we will certainly suggest your budgeting that extra $100 because it will give you a lot of headroom to work with in the coming years the new iPad pro has also come with 6 gigabytes of RAM whereas the previous models came with 4 gigs that is not all that much compared to others but given how iPad OS handles multitasking it should be plenty for your needs now moving on to the screens there is nothing new here but let us quickly go through the bullet points for those of you that haven't been following the iPad pros have LCD screens which Apple calls liquid retina fancy name aside they support the 121st refresh rates for super smooth scrolling animations as well as effortless Apple pencil drawing near resolution delivers a pixel density of 265 PPI which is not quite as dense as most smartphones but still looks plenty sharp again there is also face ID on board and again it will work no matter which orientation you're holding the iPad in now if only the iPhones would adopt the same technology that will be pretty nice okay turning to the back you have the cameras but what are they all about the new iPad pro models adopt the same kitchen stone like camera module that we first saw on the iPhone 11 series but they work a bit differently you have a 12 megapixel white camera and then a 10 megapixel ultra white one that third lens you see on the pictures is a time-of-flight camera or to be more precise a lidar scanner lidar is the same technology used for self-driving cars and it is a very advanced depth recognition depth perception sensor the goal here is not to avoid other cars as it's used before but instead Apple uses it to create instant and very accurate augmented reality applications and games Cupertino has said time and time again that it believes that AR is the future as opposed to VR virtual reality which many companies have given up on and this lidar scanner will also probably make it to the iPhone 12 Pro models which will come later this year now you've all probably seen the new magic keyboard as well it has a built-in trackpad backlit keys and suspends the iPad in the air making it look a lot like a conventional laptop but even cooler unfortunately that accessory will launch sometime in May so there's a bit of a wait ahead of us and prices started $300 a lot for a keyboard by the way if you're thinking about buying the new iPad pro models just so you can use the magic keyboard we'd like to inform you that this new accessory will also support the iPad pro 11 and the iPad pro 12 point 9 from 2018 so if you have one of those older versions or happen to find one at a bargain price you only need to buy the magic keyboard once it comes out okay let's talk about pricing and purchasing decisions the new iPad pro 11 starts at $800 and yeah cut pro 2.9 starts at $1000 for those prices you get a base which of 128 gigabytes and Wi-Fi only connectivity as we talked about earlier you can choose to upgrade to 256 gigabytes of storage for only $100 extra which is not a bad deal when you're looking at the long term perspective going up in storage tiers you can also get a 512 gigabyte version and even a 1 terabyte storage model but these are a bit excessive and will cost you $200 extra each we wouldn't suggest going that far unless you're really really serious about using the iPad pro is your main computing or work machine now if you're thinking that now is the right time to order a 20-18 iPad from although at a discounted price oh it really isn't right now the 2018 iPad pro 11 inch with 64 gigs of storage will cost you around $700 in Amazon and these 64 gigs will not get you very far if you're looking to make full use of the powerful tablet so overall this new iPad pro is a big and welcome upgrade it brings the iPad closer to a traditional laptop than ever before you still don't have the professional apps like Final Cut Pro for video editors and logic for some people that you will find on Mac OS but for the casual user and the creative types this is a great new offering and it does work with the Apple pencil and that wraps up our quick look at the new iPad pros as you have probably noticed the environment here is different I'm tuning in
