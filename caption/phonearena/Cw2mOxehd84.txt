Hira well look at what phone Arina got the world's most expensive and exquisite foldable phone while ace mates XS which would wager to say it's also the best foldable phone yet as it keeps the promise of all the books for a big screen that turns into an even bigger screen better than the competition why here's the scoop there are three distinct foldable phone designs so far clamshells like the Galaxy flip and motor race er the in folding concept of the galaxy fold and the so called out for the type of the mate XS here that handsomely wins the design practicality round what's the problem with the other two flexible phone concepts you ask well many forms of the clamshell or in folding type of a puny external display so far forcing you to open them all too often for well most anything you might want to do it on them and we check our phones more than a hundred times a day with the out folding mate XS however you get a generous 6 inch plus display where you can easily do the vast majority of your smartphone and which can quickly turn into a tablet sized eight incher for longer reading browsing watching our gaming sessions while the thinnest foldable in open state the phone is still around the thick and heavy when closed if you judge by an on follow standard so bear that in mind you simply push on the hatch release button and straighten the solve this play out around the hinge in the middle set hinges quarter falconwing and has been so over engineered with a sink corneum plated mechanism for durability after the original galaxy fault Fiasco then it actually requires quite a bit of force to push down on the middle and open the mate excess and to your muscle memory kicks in after a few tries there is naturally a slight bump in the middle of the soft display just as there is a crease on the galaxy fault and both phone makers warned that some wrinkling and ridges may occur via a slight bump when the phone is open doesn't really detract from the viewing experience as much as we expected and with time we even got so used to it that we forget it's there except for the purpose of explaining it here since people's biggest worry with the out folding design that has the bendy display facing the user at all time sir drop scuffs and scratches we'll get this out of the way first wow it has address those fears and the matrix S does have screen protection no we didn't try to peel it off as well as this bumper case in the box while the material is going to a foldable display ensure durability against drops the panel is after all made with a plastic not a glass substrate and the multi-layer covering is not glass as well so there is less chance for something to crack or split when dropped the slope display covers much as easily though also you'd have to wipe it more often than a glass oleophobic coating if you want a pristine State the displays minimum brightness and it's white balance presentation are excellent and the screen leaves something to be desired outdoors as the peak brightness is about average now here comes the most interesting part what can you do when you open the phone and get an H 8 inch display well wow it makes reading surfing the web or browsing Instagram the most joyful experience from the phone the displays nearly square aspect ratio doesn't add as much value with its size when it comes to media consumption video playback is actually the biggest gripe we have with the otherwise giant and throat made excess display since most of them are shown in the sixteen to nine format and the eight to 7.1 screen is almost square when opened there are thick black scripts above and below the video defeating the purpose of heaven 18 chirp you know for some pictures in the gallery but at least you can zoom those in needless to say you can get a third-party player like MX that allows you to stretch and fuel the display but overall the square format is a rather squishy one to watch videos in what we were more interested in was the tailored for follow those interface components and how has one way addressed the usability challenges and advantages that stem from the dynamic layout first off when closed the phone is a hard a six point six inch monkey donut no punch hole no nothing just screen thus Eve a six point six centuries enough for you as a daily driver you don't even need to open the matrix s the rear 6 point 4 inch display part kicks in when se you want to take a selfie as they camera kit sits right next to it push the button to release the far end of the screen open it straight and the interface sprawls over a vast 8 inch real-estate a key and more to a small tablet rather than default interface scales accordingly and you don't have to do anything but set the keyboard in one of the many modes split one-handed or floating that you feel most comfortable if you need split screen multitasking there is always multi window mode when you reach the bezel for a back gesture but hold you down a bit the strip menu with app shortcuts appear and you can throw any combo of browsers Maps calculators messaging apps etc in a side-by-side of floating view the fall sports a rather respectable camera cute we're they are large 1440 megapixel main sensor ultra wide and optical zoom cameras while the camera app has many all mode it allows you to shooting the full resolution even in RAW format when it tapped the selfie camera icon the full prompts you to flip it over as the selfie camera cute is actually the main camera one advantage of always ingenious matrix s design certain have fir prettier than usual self-portraits the camera samples came out well with good dynamic range coverage and plenty of detail the main camera produces slightly warmer yellowish color is compared to shooting with the 16 megapixel white or 8 megapixel telephone cameras and if you seem a bit washed out the ki-rin my nanny chipset can deal with 4k video recording but Wow is recommended format in the camera app is the YouTube friendly Full HD in the regular 16 to 9 aspect the colors are vibrant dynamic range good and the video stabilization works well the battery life is also very good we got about the day and a half with normal usage unless you browse your game on the and fro display for long sessions which could really drain it thankfully there is a general 65 volt brick in the box to fully charge the phone in about an hour overall when it comes to design practicality and hardware we found them matrix s to be the best falling phone released so far a big 6 inch plus handset when closed a veritable 8 inch tablet when opened that's what foldable phones were supposed to bring and Huawei still managed to keep things relatively thin and small performance and snap pictures and video are good and tailored for foldables interface has some interesting layout ideas unfortunately you will only be able to import it in the US and such portables are prohibitively expensive to make an old yet the matrix s is undeniably a unique head turner and if you like to be different you would appreciate only one this was a video review of the matrix s from fall arena more information you
