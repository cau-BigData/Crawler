whether you love or hate Apple there is no denying that the company has a tremendous influence over the smartphone market prime examples include the removal of the beloved headphone jack and the rise of the notch display while the hugely popular air pots have been shamelessly copied by established brands more than once a few days ago a piece of information about Apple's 20:21 iPhones describing another trend that Apple might be about to kick-start the report coming from a reliable source said that Apple is planning to remove the Lightning port from its most expensive iPhone model for that year the plan is to introduce an iPhone delivering a completely wireless experience this isn't the first time hear of a port less foam a few Chinese manufacturers have even shown prototypes but that has made it to the market just yet but why would that will kill the Lightning port we're all familiar with Apple's pursuit of sleek design but that wouldn't be the prime reason for the removal of the Lightning port in its own words Apple is a company that believes in a wireless future dropping the connector could be a part of that transition meant to bring both the company's products and the industry as a whole into the next decade on top of being in line that Apple's long-term philosophy a completely Wireless iPhone with no connector would be more durable it should be easier to secure against water damage while damage ports and free charging cables could become a thing of the past additionally removing the port would free up valuable space inside the phone for things like a bigger battery additional cameras or 5g antennas but to move forward Apple must offer something better for its users after it removed the Lightning port this means improving on what the port does now charging data transfer and connectivity with headphones and accessories headphones are easy airports are already doing a great job as replacing traditional wired earbuds data transfer is taking care of partly with features like airdrop though Windows users might require some special attention from Apple if the cable is to disappear but we know Apple is good with dongles right Marlys charging is also mostly solved apart from one problem well your devices on the wireless charger it's pretty much unusable will that change by 2021 it's possible if Apple has been secretly developing a technology that would allow not only Wireless but also contactless charging this seems like a long shot however perhaps we'll have to stick to charging overnight while there might be no port to plug a cable into that doesn't mean there couldn't be something else to serve the functions of the Lightning port a solution similar to the magnetic connector the iPad pro uses for its keyboard or for charging of the Apple pencil this could work perfectly by combining the best of both worlds the benefits of a portable design on the one hand and the functionality of a wired connection for those that really need it on the other the truth is for some applications you just cannot go wireless at least not as soon as 2021 more importantly those applications are mostly related to professional work low latency high bitrate audio connections as the card readers external hard drives and all sorts of other Lightning port accessories and Apple relies on professionals not so much for iPhone sales as it does for marketing all those creators give the brand its hip and cool vibe it can't risk pushing them away no matter what the specific solution is one thing is certain Apple will cause a stir in the smartphone industry as soon as the new iPhone with no ports goes on sale R&D teams all over the world would salmon it inside and out hardware and software soon after concepts for in-house alternatives will be created but other companies will wait to see how well the new portlets iPhone sales before they make a move if people don't hate it those other executives who have to make an important decision the decision will put each brand in one of three camps camp number one Apple did it we're doing it undoubtedly there will be companies that will rush to mimic Apple without proper planning and R&D chances are their users who get something have baked the creates more problems than it solves some of the larger manufacturers might dip their toes by releasing a port less phones as part of a less important line just to test users reactions camp number two we'll do it when we're ready this is the intelligent way to go about this make sure you're not sacrificing functionality first and then when you have a technology that's mature enough implement it into your products sure it's still technically following Apple but at least it's done the right way and camp number three we're not doing it some companies will straight-up ignore what Apple did and keep doing whatever they had planned of course with no ports eventually becoming the standard they'll go for it as well but at that point it doesn't really count as following Apple hopefully no matter what happens we won't have to go through another set of ads from companies mocking Apple for their decision only for those same companies to follow suit a few years later and discreetly remove the set as from YouTube I'm looking at you Samsung and Google of course that's assuming if a bow itself makes such a huge transition work which is far from granted so do you think we'll see Portland's iPhones as soon as 2021 and are you ready for the wireless future tell us in the comments below don't forget to Like and subscribe for more of our
