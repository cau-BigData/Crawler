hey guys it's John be here with phone ring and this is a quick first hands-on look at the new Moto Z for now this mark phone kind of is very similar to last year's e3 in fact there many key similarities but it's kind of interesting how they're really prepping this phone because they say supply ship but typically these specs are indicative of what type of device it is it is running a snapdragon 675 processor so just like the Google pixel 3a I probably classify it more as a mid-range device than a flagship now before I get into the nitty gritty about the phone we'll talk about the biggest and most pressing thing about the z4 and that's the price because just like the Google pixel 3a it is relatively affordable but there is a catch now you could buy the phone through Verizon for $500 outright but if you are a new customer opening a new line and want to pick up the z4 you're only going to pay 10 bucks a month for 24 months so that brings its total cost to 204 dollars which yes it does undercut the pixel 3/8 and a lot of phones in this specs range but again if you're not a brand new customer you just still paying 500 bucks for it so you may have to think about your options at that point now just like the z3 last year the z4 here is also 5g capable so if you love an area that has that or it's gonna have it very soon definitely want to think about getting that you have to just purchase the 5g moto mod and because of that the design is a very familiar one they really don't stray too much from what we've seen in the past it looks exactly like the z3 it's a solid construction pretty much all metal and the difference here this time rounds on the front you'll look here it actually has an all screen look so very minimal bezels there's a teardrop notch very discreet with the front-facing camera there's a beautiful six point four inch OLED display on here great colors the other thing you notice here is that there isn't a fingerprint sensor on the back instead it has an N screen fingerprint sensor which is nice definitely and I also like the fact that also features a headphone jack now another thing worth talking about here are the cameras on the back you have a 48 Bank pixel camera motorola says it's the larger size sensor they put into a phone to date but they didn't specifically say what the size is I'm just hoping it's gonna be great just like the pixel 3a it also features quad pixel technology which combined with its new night vision mode it's going to offer some really good low-light performance as they say again hopefully it's gonna be on par to what all the other phones do out there like the pixel 3a the p30 pro so it's gonna be interesting to see how it fares and then around the front you have a sizable 28 megapixel camera which is definitely larger than most others out there so hopefully it's gonna do really well when it comes to selfies it's running a mostly stock Android 9pi experience which is nice but of course you have Motorola's optimizations in there in the form of moto display the moto actions you can quickly launch the camera by twisting the phone a couple times and even turning on the flash you want to and it's running pretty fast as far as the navigation across the UI it's smooth its responsive it is running a snapdragon 675 processor so not quite flagship level I'd say it is accompanied with 4 gigabytes of RAM and it's only available in a hundred twenty eight gigabyte capacity but it does have expandable storage with a micro SD card slot going back to what I talked about earlier the z4 here is being pegged as a rival to the pixel 3a there are a lot of things I like about the phone that has certain advantages over the pixel 3a for example you can get the in screen fingerprint sensor you do have expandable storage and yes it is 5g capable and you do also have all those motor mods choose from so it has a nice selection right there but the thing is the price point at 500 bucks outright the normal price for this phone it's still a tough call I probably still recommend the Google pay cell 3 unless this really blows it out of the water in terms of the performance out of the camera the battery the overall responsiveness of the phone but at 240 bucks for a brand new subscriber to Ross that is super attractive and definitely undercuts the pixel three in many aspects and that is it for a quick hands-on look here at the moto z4 if you guys want to learn more about it you could check out our website phone ring accom is on be signing off
