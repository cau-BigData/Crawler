pretty fresh an RPG fans so you'll definitely be getting some diablo vibes from it the game is humongous and you definitely sing quite a bit of time in it if the agent graphics don't bother you too much it's a fair investment for any action RPG fan another RPG worth playing is oceanhorn this is an adventure RPG with some very heavy Zelda influences it says in a vast fantasy world and takes you through a story which won't wow you with something groundbreaking but at least it's charming the focus here as with Zelda games is on exploration leave no stone unturned if that's the kind of game you're in to give oceanhorn a try Android users can test the pre demo before committing to a purchase this is of course the predecessor of oceanhorn - one of a pork aids flagship exclusive games next a classic Planescape torment enhanced edition another game that helps from the old era of PC RPGs namely this one was originally in 1991 release so yeah it says remastered in the title but don't expect to Shining Beauty once you open it up but if you care more about gameplay depth and hardcore a RPG experience this shouldn't bother you and Planescape torment is still royalty when it comes to a RPG to top it off is set within the universe of Dungeons & Dragons and carries a hefty chunk a story to go through the mobile remaster holds up well and the controls don't feel too clunky another cool game we recommend is forced fantasy part hero collector RPG part farmer part PvP action game fantasy you can collect a level of your heroes all you want and offline then take them online for some PvP action it even has an autoplay switch so you can set your phone on your desk and still level up while actually doing work next we have pocket rolls this is a top-down action RPG in a very retro style it has heavy roguelike elements with perma death procedurally generated levels in the leveling up system which allows you to dive back in the dungeons slightly more powerful than last time there are tons of classes and items to experiment with and it will take you quite a while before you can beat this one another RPG worth your time is post Knight post Knight is a pretty simplistic game people scratching that RPG itch when you don't have much time to commit to something more complex basically you're delivering letters and packages between villages each level represents the roll from point A and point B and since this isn't a Kojima game you actually battle a bunch of falls before you can reach your destination well battle is used loosely here your character bumps into the enemies until somebody dies of course you have some heroes skills to help you out as well as a leveling system and different inventory items to make your postman tougher and last but not least comes a game called a girl adrift another simple RPG the world has been flooded in humanity is only comprised of survivors living on small remote islands your character survives by living on a raft and fishing for tons and tons of well fish just so happens that every little human settlement needs you to go and fish something for them the gameplay itself is simply tapped based top to drop the fishing pole rapidly tough to battle with the fish once you've caught one and this is the game and this is also our selection of the best offline RPGs for iPhone and Android that we recommend you check out in 2020 which are your favorites let us know in the comments thank you for watching my name is Vic this is phone arena don't forget to like us and subscribe for more awesome videos and I will talk to you in the next one
