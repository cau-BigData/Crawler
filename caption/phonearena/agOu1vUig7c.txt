the new Galaxy 90 is the first phone that brings 5g connectivity at a price way lower than that of a flagship while the top-tier Galaxy S 10 + 5 G model costs nearly $1300 the 895 G can be head for about half that price hello guys Vic with phoner in here and we've got to spend some time with the new 895 G addition at the ephah tech show and this phone is surprisingly good for the money these are our first impressions the phone comes in two classic color options black and white but it stands out thanks to the unique geometric pattern on the back glass twist and turn it around and reflects light beautifully and it also feels very well made it sports a huge 6.7 inch Super AMOLED display with full HD plus resolution and that screen looks gorgeous it comes with a tiny water drop shaped notch which accommodates a 32 megapixel selfie camera the phone also has a fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen another traditional flagship feature probably most impressive however is the massive 4500 milliamp hour battery inside when you're connected to 5g the battery drain is much higher but this large battery should handle it well the phone also supports 25 watt fast charging without the need to buy a separate adapter as far as the specs go samsung has teamed up with Qualcomm to include the Snapdragon 855 chipset while the X 55 G model supports the 5g connectivity the phone also comes in either 6 gigabytes or 8 gigs of RAM and it features 128 gigabytes of expandable storage on the back side there is a triple camera setup which includes the main 48 megapixel sensor a depth 5 megapixel sensor and an ultra-wide 8 megapixel camera for the best possible results the main camera supports familiar Samsung tricks a super steady mode and the scene optimizer camera quality is one area where we expect this a 90 to be a bit behind the other flagships so don't quite expect the very best here this is also the first galaxy a series phone that includes decks so you can get your notifications and messages on a PC the galaxy 95g is trying to appeal to a slightly different audience that can't afford to purchase a flagship but still wants those 5g speeds the fall is coming to Europe in October for a price of 750 euro while a US launch is not impossible but Samsung has refused to comment on that yet what do you think about this new and more affordable 5g phone are you ready to make the jump to the network of the future let us know in the comments my name is Vic it was a pleasure talking to you and I will see you next time right here in fallen Arena [Music]
