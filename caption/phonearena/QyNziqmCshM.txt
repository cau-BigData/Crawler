20-19 has been another crazy year for smartphones and we had fallen Arena has spent long hours debating and discussing all the new devices that we have used and tested throughout the year and now it's time to sum it all up with the highlights of 2019 I'm your host Vic and we kick things off with the most discussed category the best overall phone of the year after a lot of debate most of us agree that the iPhone 11 Pro Series this year have truly made some impressive progress and deserve this award the big gains in battery life the new light mode that works automatically to improve your low-light shots the new ultra wide camera the industry-leading video quality the beautiful screen and last but not least the app ecosystem and privacy of the iOS platform all combined to make this the best overall phone of the year it's not the perfect Phone iOS 13 launched with a surprising amount of bugs and glitches the Apple platform is lower nearly as customizable and open as Android in the price for these iPhones is still sky high but still next up we look at the best Android phone money can buy this one was a very tough call but most of us agreed that the Samsung Galaxy Note Templars deserves this award the new note brought a refined design with tiny bezels and a gorgeous screen that many would consider the prettiest in 2019 the new Samsung one UI was universally praised for its ease of use the s-pen was a nice addition the battery life was very good and the camera setup is versatile and captures good-looking photos and videos in various conditions if you don't want to pay top dollar you still want a great smartphone and the best value for money offered this year for us is the oneplus 70 priced at just $600 the new oneplus brings the fastest chip on the market the Snapdragon 855 plus coupled with eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of on-board storage specs covered don't tell the whole story here there are cheaper phones out of China with similar specs what matters here is the way oneplus has optimized the Android experience so everything runs extremely quickly and smooth a feeling you don't quite get on other phones you have a beautiful flat AMOLED screen with a 90 Hertz refresh rate that adds to the feeling of speed and you get very decent battery life there are two shortcomings the biggest one is the camera quality which is definitely good for the price not quite amazing and also the lack of wireless charging the next eageriy is another hotly contested one the phone with the best battery life after testing the heck out of all phones you can say that this award goes to the huawei made 30 pro which means the iPhone 11 pro max by a tiny bit unfortunately always monster flagship phone is not available in most countries in the West but it does get the best battery award it also comes with the fastest wireless charging we have seen using 27 watts to charge up its big 4,500 million power battery in just about an hour and 20 minutes looking away from flagships something truly remarkable happened this year a great budget phone with a flagship grade camera launched and it is also the winner of our best affordable phone award there's the Google pixel 3a at under $400 the 3a and the three XL deliver super smooth performance a clean Android interface the latest updates on time and the great pixel camera experience including support for nitesite the 3a series are made of plastic and don't quite Q as premium as other phones so they come with a slightly slower processor than flagship phones but if you are after the experience and not the looks these are truly great we always love to see new companies enter the phone game and the award for the best newcomer to the market this year goes to the incredible real me x2 Pro real me is an offshoot of Chinese phone maker Oppo and you may have not even heard about this brand but it's worth checking out it's just $400 this phone brings the flagship snapdragon a 55 plus chip which is just insane at this price it's indeed a very fast phone and it also looks the part with premium materials using as design the other highlights include the 90 her display 50 watt super book fast charging vapor chamber cooling for gamers and more speaking of gamers if you are serious about playing games on your smart the best gaming phone of the Year award goes to the Isuzu Oh phone to this beast of a device Council of 120 Hertz display so you can react to everything that happens in the game in a snap plus it has a special gaming mode let make sure that the phone maintains high frame rates and you're not interrupted while playing we also love the game controllers made by Asus specifically for this phone if you great and will take your gaming to the next level the only downside is that this phone is a bit on the pricey side and might feel a bit too big for comfortable everyday carry next up we have the award for the most innovative smartphone of the year this is the device that pushed the boundaries of what's possible that dare to dream big and despite a shaky start for us this is the Samsung Galaxy fold years in the making the first foldable phone costs a small fortune but it works and it's a sci-fi dream come to life it folds out to a tablet size 7.3 inch display that makes everything look bigger and better and it's an absolute productivity monster and after problems with the first version the second one that Samsung released seems to be doing okay and not break so if you have $2,000 to burn you might want to try it out to get a taste of a possible future after the excitement we should also look the other way and mention the biggest flop of the year fortunately as much as phone makers try they sometimes just don't quite manage to realize their vision and this year the biggest flop was a Nokia 9 PureView a phone that enthusiasts have been anticipating for years the supposin promised land for camera lovers it just turned out to be one big mess the multi-camera setup barely worked the image quality was not great to put it mildly using the camera drained the battery like crazy the fingerprint reader would not work properly and as a whole using the phone was one big frustration and this runs up our awards for phones but we have a couple more for individual features that we loved the best new hardware feature award goes to 90 Hertz displays this small improvement in display refresh rate might not be something super obvious but after you use the 90 Hertz form for a while you just feel the faster performance the other big new hardware feature that impressed us was the periscope camera system that some filmmakers included having the ability to zoom in 5 times 10 times and further on the phone without losing much in terms of quality is truly an incredible experience for camera enthusiasts finally the best new software features of the Year award goes unequivocally to dark mode a system-wide dark mode where the background of apps turns dark made using our phones at night much easier on the eyes and much more enjoyable for everyone there is still room for improvement dark mode is still not available in most browsers and many phones you have to remember to manually turn it on and off which is a bit annoying but we hope those who get fixed in 2020 speaking of 2020 there are lots of great new phones coming and we couldn't be more excited about the future of technology we hope you are too and we hope you follow tech with us to do that simply subscribe to our channel follow Reena and drop us a comment with your thoughts
