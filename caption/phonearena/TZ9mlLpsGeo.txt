20:19 shapes up to be a great year for those looking for an affordable phone with no compromises after the revolutionary Google pixel 3a now Motorola has come up with a budget model of its own that exceeds expectations hello guys my name is Vic with fond marina and in the past few days I have been using the new Motorola one vision a tall and narrow phone that I have grown quite fond of the thing that stands out the most with the Motorola one vision is the new format the phone has a tall and narrow body thanks to the 21 by 9 cinema vision screen different from most other phones that use wider screens so why the 21 by nine format you wonder actually it turns out that these are the exact proportions that filmmakers use to achieve that all-engulfing cinematic effect so watching netflix on this phone is an absolute joy while such a narrow phone definitely looks a bit weird at first I quickly got used to it and such a design is perfect for one-handed use for browsing and reading however the screen is not ideal as you can see less text and you have to scroll more vigorously speaking of the screen it's a 6.2 inch full HD LCD display so you don't get the newer AMOLED technology with rich colors and deep blacks not just that but overall colors on the screen appear very cold and whites have a ghostly blue tonality unfortunately there is no way to tweet this in the settings and this is a big letdown the screen of a phone is one of its most important components and sadly Motorola didn't do a great job with it here as cool as this new design is it comes with one interruption in the form of a quite big and noticeable cutout right here in the front for the front camera we have seen this punch hole design in the Galaxy S Pen series but here the hole for the camera is just way bigger and way more noticeable Motorola says it could make it smaller but that would have compromised the durability of the phone and the larger cutout ensures a thicker bezel and more protection for the on camera in case of a drop and that's a good reason but we still wished that cloud was not as huge the phone also uses a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back right where the Moto logo stands and it's a fast and reliable fingerprint scanner that works well and since we started with the screen and with watching videos there is one more thing that we love about this phone the loudspeaker is surprisingly good sound is powerful punchy and has depth to it especially surprising considering that the phone uses just one button firing speaker good job Motorola speaking of sound we should also say that you get a headphone jack at the top of the phone but matches this you also get a pair of quite decent headphones for free in the box under the hood the Motorola one vision is powered by a Samsung made octa-core exynos chip with four gigs of RAM on board now this processor is similar in performance to the snapdragon 666 meaning that it is nowhere nearly as good as a flagship phone but this doesn't mean that the phone is slow quite the opposite in the daily grind is felt zippy apps load fast there's no stutter actually is a very smooth experience now gamers however would miss the extra performance power of a flagship we were also pleasantly surprised by the generous 128 gigs of storage that you get onboard here now that is twice as much as most phones in this price range and it's also twice as much as you get on the more expensive pixel 3a the one vision also has a hybrid card slot so you can either use it as a dual SIM device or use it as a single sim phone with a micro SD card the interface here is Android one which is a clean and bloatware free version of Android and this is a great thing Motorola is also promising two major updates so as this phone currently runs on Android 9pi you get the Android 10-q update this year and the Android 11 are next year you also get moto actions a few useful tricks that moto phones have had in the last couple of years twist the phone to quickly start the camera double chop to turn on the flashlight and touch the screen three fingers to capture a screenshot turning to the camera you get a 48 megapixel main shooter in the five megapixel secondary camera that captures death while up front you have a twenty five megapixel selfie camera Motorola uses all these resources to combine four pixels into one to achieve better image quality so the actual photos that you get are 12 megapixel from the main camera and 6 megapixels from the front one well numbers however never tell the whole story about the quality of a phone camera what matters is how photos and videos actually look and the Motorola 1 vision camera is good just good not extraordinary in any way especially when you compare it against new heavyweights like the Google pixel 3a during the day photos are well exposed and the colors are pleasingly realistic not too strong or too bleak the camera is also quick to capture photos and works reliably well all great points what we don't like is that whenever you have something brighter in the photo like the skies for example those brighter areas are basically always burned and you just don't have enough dynamic range portrait mode works quite well too and you can capture portraits with a blurred background with the front camera as well we also love the cinema graph option in the camera interface well cinema graphs are basically a photograph part of which is moving and this format just invites you to get creative it's awesome at night you have two options the first one is to just shoot and the photos that you get are quite dark blurry just not very good however you can do something else too you can switch to the night vision mode and wow what a huge difference this makes first the night vision mode is surprisingly quick it takes less than a second to capture a photo so you don't need to wait for a long time like we'd say Huawei phones but the results are also truly impressive now this is not the next Google pixel 3 or 3a but it really is not too far behind colors dynamic range all of that looks great with this mode and only when you blow up the images on a big screen you see the typical issues with shots like over sharpening and the less detail for video you can record it up to 4k and 30 frames per second many other phones in this price range don't have 4k video so we appreciate having the option but the quality is just not great video turns out a bit shaky colors appear a bit washed out and the focus hunts around the bed there's a battery life the moto one vision scored above the average and our charts and in real life we had absolutely no issues going a full long day but this is not a phone that would last much longer than that thankfully have an 18 watt quick charger in the box so the battery tops up in less than two hours despite the glass back the phone does not support wireless charging okay all things considered is the new Motorola one vision the budget phone that you should buy in 2019 for a price of around three hundred dollars it offers excellent value for the money it is fast the new tall and narrow format is easy to get used to it's comfortable for one-handed use and it's night vision photos turn out surprisingly great however Motorola has really let us down with the screen we don't mind the LCD technology but we don't like that colors just look too cold and ghostly on it and if you value a great screen as much as we do then you would know that it's hard to recommend the moto 1 vision for this one reason and this wraps up our review thanks for staying with us until the end thumbs up if you enjoy the video subscribe for more my name is Vic Christoph which was my pleasure talking to you and I'll see you next time
