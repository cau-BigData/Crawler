the galaxy 51 is the newest mid-range phone by Samsung that will replace the very popular a 50 from 2019 and it offers a more modern design as well as a few key improvements to the camera hello guys my name is Vic with fawn arena and it's time to unbox the a 51 look inside the box to see what comes with it and take it for a spin so let's get this party started first inside the box you see the a 51 and you immediately notice is striking design with a fancy geometrical prison pattern on the back that looks interesting and different what else is in the box a 15 watt Samsung fast charger a pair of headphones that use the good old headphone jack that you can still find on this phone you can a standard USB to USB C cable for charging you also have some literature and a sim ejector that we don't show here one thing you should know from the get-go is that this phone looks beautiful but it's also made from plastic we don't mind but just know that plastic has the upside of being almost impossible to break and still scratch is quite easily looking at the phone you have the power and the volume buttons on the right side while on the bottom you find the USB C port for charging as well as the headphone jack the big highlight is the camera bump on the back which is big in houses for different cameras more on that later at the front you have a punch hole front camera I've changed from the teardrop notch on the a 50 then it looks more elegant and discreet Samsung is very well aware of the punch hole and it even included a wallpaper with Minnie Mouse playfully pointing towards it nice little touch far up the phone and Wow should read it with what is probably the coolest live wallpaper you have ever seen it only highlights the best thing about buying even a budget samsung phone like this one you still get an industry-leading beautiful AMOLED screen the one on the a 51 measures 6.5 inches and it features a 1080p resolution and a 20 by 9 aspect ratio it is perfectly sharp colors are rich viewing angles are good in its overall beauty to behold plus is covered with Gorilla Glass 3 for protection now built under the screen is an optical fingerprint scanner we have already set it up and it seems to work quite well maybe just a tad bit slower than expensive phones but look under the hood and you find probably the weakest part of the galaxy 51 this phone is powered by the Samsung made Exynos 96 11 processor paired with 4 gigs of ram and the experience is not quite as smooth and as fast as you would have on a phone like the pixel 3a the chip on the 8051 is a mid-range one that's comparable to the snapdragon 6 series there is a bit of a stutter here and there now not a deal-breaker but it is noticeable well it's excellent however is that you get a generous 128 gigabytes of on-board storage plus you have support for microSD cards should you want to expand that storage on the software front the a51 comes with the latest Android 10 on top of its own Samsung 1 UI interface also in its latest form now the biggest new feature here that you'll notice is the new gesture navigation you can switch to the gesture navigation by going to settings then display the navigation bar it works nicely ok let's jump to the part where Samsung has made the biggest changes this year the camera you have four of them on the back a brand new 48 megapixel for the main sensor high resolution 12 megapixel ultra wide camera a dedicated macro camera and a depth sensor for better port it follows take a look at a couple of shots we capture it on the a51 and right next to them the same shots captured on the Google pixel 3 a what do you think my initial thoughts are that da 51 has improved but it's still not a match for the incredible dynamic range of the pixel a front you have a 32 megapixel camera on the galaxy which captures decent looking selfies and can also record 1080p videos and speaking of video the main camera on the back can now record an up to 4k resolution it also supports a super steady stabilization mode that we saw more expensive Galaxy phones earlier last but not least we should mention that the a 51 comes with a quite big 4 thousand milliamp hour battery that seems very promising and you also get support for 15 watt fast charging but there is no wireless charging and that runs up our first look at the new galaxy 51 it's a very likable phone that is not too big his beautiful design brings slight improvements to the camera from last year and also has an excellent battery life but makes one compromise and the speed and performance Department where it feels a bit underpowered we will be shooting more photos and videos with it comparing it against the main rival the pixel 3/8 and testing his battery in the coming days so stay tuned for that now this wraps up this video but I wanted to try something new this time around and read up some comments to see what you guys have been up to and let's take a look at what the top comment was for the last phone video in May first comment vid Petrovitch says who TF edited this video I don't like these transitions sorry vid it was me and I really liked them I guess many people didn't so I'll have to reconsider them maybe less of them next time I don't know if this is just about me alone I prefer plastic phone with flat screens it's definitely not just you many people prefer plastic phones that don't break as easily and of course are cheaper and this so this is one such phone so I definitely appreciate plastic phones as well maybe more plastic phones in the future especially the cheaper ones next comment from Joseph stead agathi these transitions are really fringe buys glass foam puts a case on it make them all plastic or a commented this agreed Ian Scott says the first pixel had a headphone jack - that's true so the headphone jack on the main pixel line is gone but the a-series still have it so that's nice to have i still use the wired headphones at work and I find them quite useful also in my car if you use the aux cable for connecting to your car stereo or something else it's quite a useful feature if you don't want to deal with dongles so this was fun I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget about the thumbs up button if you enjoyed watching this drop a comment if you're feeling extra cool and subscribe to see even more from us and I will see in the next one
