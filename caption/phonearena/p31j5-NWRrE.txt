the Galaxy S 11 series camera is shaping up to be the most exciting thing that has happened to mobile photography since the advent of zoom cameras and night mold and it's worth a dedicated preview from us here at phone marina just look at these new features how do they sound as a pro photographer well if rumors from a variety of credible sources are to be believed that's what is expecting us with the Galaxy S 11 series and then some first off let's talk main sensors we 108 megapixel juggernaut that Samsung developed for shammies Meno 10 will reportedly see an upgrade for its all nest 11 models heck Samsung even trademarked the phrase bright night sensor and that can't be a coincidence usually this many pixels mean a lot of noise and crosstalk all features that are detrimental to clean and sharp photos in the dusk word from the grapevine however is that the s 11th gen sensor will still churn out the 12 megapixel photos you know and love but each pixel will be crafted out of nine in binning mode as opposed to the usual four neighboring pixels piggybacked into one this way the S 11 plus will eventually land virtual pixels with a record 2.4 micron size which bodes well for well everything from low light sensitivity to color presentation and dynamic range with the main sensor and still photos taken care of we're moving on to the rumors space zoom feature that Samsung trademark not long ago after the p30 Pro is 5 times optical zoom of the periscope type that houses the sensor perpendicular to the last it is now a thing to advocate how your phone can zoom far enough to take pictures of celestial objects with Samsung buying core photonics the inventors of this folding Lance's room tack the s11 series are very likely to use five times optical periscope zoom 50 times hybrid zoom with some cropping from the huge sensor output and up to 100 times digital magnification the Samsung will have every right to call space heck it has even cold name ds-11 plus camera hobo internally last but not least the snapdragon 865 chipset the samsung will now use for the s11 models in the States and also in Korea is image centric for the first time Qualcomm added support for up to 200 mega pixel cameras triple frame HDR 80 video and even 4k HDR footage at 120 fps if you're so inclined so we can reasonably expect all of this to be present on the s11 phones at least to some extent rounding up the camera features are the newly trademarked director's view that will let you record the server of the lenses simultaneously similar to always duo view as well as a single take mode which will create the shots of your lifetime by simply panning around with the s11 series camera for a few seconds to recap our s Levin series camera preview after few years of stagnation in terms of snapping Hardware Samsung will be jumping headfirst in the crazy camera trend by outing flagship phones with record sensor resolution and doubling down on the insane zoom marketing by introducing a space zoom mode for the Galaxy S 11 pocket so it can't wait to take the S 11 series to the pit with the other ginger knots out there and that wraps up our preview of the galaxy s 11 camera don't forget to let us know your thoughts about it in the comments give this video a like if you enjoyed it subscribe for more and I will talk to you in the next one you
