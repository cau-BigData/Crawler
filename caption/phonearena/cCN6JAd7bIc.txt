the Apple watch was off to a rough start in 2015 it was slow third-party apps took forever to load and battery life wasn't great but then Apple did what Apple does it iterated and iterated and then once again iterated until it got things right the Apple watch Series 5 is the latest iteration that is all about one key new feature it now has an always-on screen that allows you to inconspicuously take a quick glance at the time without having to flick your wrist all else has remained pretty much the same you still need to charge the watch every night and it looks just like the Apple watch series 4 so is this the Smart Watch for you I've been using the series 5 for a week now and it's about time for our review so how come the Apple watch series 5 finally has an always-on screen and is this always an option coming to older Apple watches - no it's not and the reason it's not is because the series 5 uses a new type of display that the older watches simply don't have the technology is called a low temperature poly-silicon and oxide display let's simply call it LTP oh and it can do one magic trick it can act like a normal screen refreshing 60 times per second or it can switch to a super slow refresh mode and refresh just once a second this new super slow refresh mode is turned on when you're not looking at the screen it is extremely battery efficient plus the screen is slightly dimmed with it this allows the new Apple watch to be always on and still have the same battery life as earlier models so does the new always-on mode also mean that everyone can read your notifications - Oh Apple has thought of this and it blurs the notifications so we can only see them when you're actively looking at the screen in my experience I would pick up the wash at around 8 a.m. in the morning and by the time I take off the wash at around 10 p.m. I'll have more than a 40% charge on a regular day when I don't work out if you are tracking a workout expect this number to be lower but for an hour or two of workouts you should they have enough juice for a full day of use on the airport series 5 but this is definitely not a two-day battery watch if you forget to charge it overnight it will likely die on you the next day now charging the watch happens via the same tiny magnetic charger that we've had since the original and it gives a 44% charge in half an hour and the full charge takes about an hour and a half the other new feature in the series 5 is a compass it's a little thing but we love having it it helps show the right directions if you're using the tiny maps on the watch and you also have a new compass complication on watch basis to show you which way north and south are and that's it for all else this feels like the same watches the series 4 certainly looks the same it's still remarkable that you have 32 gigabytes of on-board storage and you even have an app store where you can purchase apps right from your wrist a few things haven't changed well we do have automatic workout detection it doesn't really work well for example this morning I was cycling for half an hour and the watch didn't even detect that I was moving so you have to go through the tedious task of manually starting a workout almost every time still the series 5 is clearly way ahead of the competition it's much faster than all other smartwatches we've tried it detects your heart rate with very good accuracy for what it is it tracks sports with detailed data and it feels very comfortable to wear this is not a wash that you pass to your grandson but it's an incredibly fancy toy with some useful health and fitness features it's up to you whether you like that and that's our take on the new Apple watch Series five I hope you found this video fun and useful and if you did don't hesitate to drop a like and a comment and subscribe for more from us my name is Vic and I'll see you next time right here on fawn arena you you
