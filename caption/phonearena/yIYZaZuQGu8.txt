it's finally arrived the Samsung Galaxy S 2 an ultra one of the most anticipated flagship phones of 2020 and it's here in our hands it's time to unbox it take a look at the phone itself at the accessories in the box and all that's interesting about this phone my name is Vic this is fallen arena let's go and we start with unboxing this phone and the first thing you notice that the box itself is bigger than before it's quite bulky actually but so is the phone so let's open the cover and you can see right away you can see the galaxy s 20 ultra unimposing device with a massive 6.9 inch display in a big and bulky body who put it to the side and take a look at what else is inside the box and the first thing that you'll notice is that you get a fast charger this one is a 25 watt charger and for the first time Samsung is using USB C on this charger as well as on the phone so inside the box you also find a USB c2 USBC cable so we're finally entering the future and getting rid of those old standard USB connections in favor of this more convenient and reversible USB C type of connection what else is in the box you have a pair of in-ear headphones tuned by AKG and these are the familiar headphones that you get in the box with Galaxy phones if you've bought a galaxy phone before you probably have seen these this time however the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the galaxy s 20 series is gone the galaxy s 10 was the last major flagship that used to have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack but in the s20 series it's now gone and you need to rely either on wireless connection for your headphones or on USB C and this pair of in ear headphones uses the USB C connection so you can use them to play back music you also have a couple of different sized ear tips to better fit your particular shape of an ear and that's about it that's about everything you get in the box and keep in mind that that 25 watt charger is not the maximum that this phone supports this phone also supports 45 watt flash charging which is a little bit faster and this is the same type of standard that the Galaxy Note templates used to support here you need to buy that 45 watt fast chargers separately if you want to make use of those faster speeds so now let's fire up the phone and see what it's all about and right from the get-go you notice this big beautiful display almost uninterrupted by bezels you have a tiny punch hole camera right smack in the center at the top but it's very delicate and very small doesn't disrupt the experience in any significant way what else you have on the side you have the usual buttons you have the power button and the volume keys no more Bigsby button this is good news Bigsby was the kind of a system it was not quite on par with the Google assistant so it was a bit annoying having a separate button for an assistant that doesn't quite work as well so it's gone now what else we have on the phone itself of course the imposing camera module you have a brand new camera system here so we've already started talking about the camera let me tell you about the specs here the main sensor on the galaxy s 2003 is a massive 108 megapixel camera this sensor is gigantic and probably this is the main reason while this camera on this camera bump on the back is massive - just notice how it sticks out of the back of the phone another reason for that is that periscope zoom lands right here a folded periscope lens that gives you a hybrid optic zoom of up to 10 times if you use digital zoom you can go all the way up to a hundred times digital zoom which is truly impressive of course don't expect mind-boggling super clear sharp quality at 100 times digital zoom but if you settle for the 10 times option you'd be surprised at how good images come out you also have an ultra wide camera and a time-of-flight depth sensor that helps separate subjects better when you use the live focus mode for example this camera also supports 8k video and you will be testing that and a lot more in our upcoming review so stay tuned for that hello guys my name is Vic and this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 Oh Troy it's a brand new camera it can 4k video and you saw me right over there the phone was zoomed in 20 times and you can see that it has a lot of reach and a lot of potential so what would me is we test the video capabilities of the s20 ultra so that's what this way the first thing we test is video stabilization this walking slowly and now let's pick up the pace and let me show you once again give you all the way down on the board right there see if we can catch it we have 20 times digital zoom that's a lot of reach and then zoom all the way back out we won't also guide you quickly through the interface of the phone and it ships with Android 10 and the latest Samsung 1 UI 2.1 on top of that this UI is familiar it hasn't changed much but there are some slight modifications some new options like the Samsung quick share option that allows you to quickly send large files to another compatible galaxy device so this is a nice extra to have of course the biggest highlight of this phone when it comes to the screen is the new 120 Hertz refresh rate option now by default this phone ships at the traditional 60 Hertz refresh rate in order to conserve battery and give you the maximum battery life experience but if you want the smoothest performance you should definitely go into settings display and change the refresh rate to 120 Hertz you really notice that easily while just scrolling around in the browser it makes a big difference we definitely recommend you just use the most of this futuristic device so what else is new in terms of specs we have the Exynos version here now the US will get the Snapdragon eight-six 5 model that's unfortunate so you got the Exynos 990 version this is the most expect a loud there it features a massive 16 gigabytes of RAM it's probably more than you have on your laptop please on mine and what else you have here you also have 512 gigabytes a fast EFS 3.0 storage that gives you a lot of versatility with your files you might not need it right away but in a couple of years has those videos and images pile up you'll definitely appreciate having that storage and that's it guys these are our first impressions our hands-on look and our unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy S 20 ultra a phone that is all about the camera and that's what we're gonna test next we're also going to be looking at the battery you have a five thousand milliamp hour battery on this bad boy so we'll be looking at a lot more interesting test coming up soon so stay tuned for that my name is Vic this is fall Nerina let me know if you have any questions about this phone I'll be happy to answer and thank you for watching this I'll see you in the next have a good one
