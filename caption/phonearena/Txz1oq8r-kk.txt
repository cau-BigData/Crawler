it's now been three months since Wampus released the 70 in the middle of October and throughout most of this time it has been my go-to phone that replaced an iPhone 11 Pro that I was using for a few weeks before that well it has disappointed me on a couple of occasions when I found features I needed missing I'm happy to say that most of the time I have been more than satisfied with the one plus 70 and it has my solid thumbs up so what's so great about it and what are the issues you will bump into let's jump right into it the first thing I'd like to talk about is just the size of this device it has a tiny bezel and it's not too wide which makes it very comfortable to operate with one hand and carry in a pocket and this is the principle reason why I went for the 70 over the pro version but just feels a lot bigger and bulkier and there's a bit of a hassle to carry in the pocket this is also the main reason why I prefer the oneplus 70 over the iPhone 11 which is much wider and the pain to use with one hand since phones are becoming so gigantic these days and that's a problem for my use I also appreciate the protective case series made by one plus that are not too big yet provide a good amount of protection the carbon one that I'm using save the phone from doom after a five-foot drop on a concrete floor it's surprisingly durable it also keeps the buttons exposed and that's another great thing as the physical keys on the 70 aren't just so well-made and sole satisfyingly clicky and yes you also have easy access to the 3-way mute switch that is such an ingenious feature swipe it up for silent mode middle for vibrate and down for ring mold easy and super convenient next we have the optical fingerprint scanner on the phone which is fast and works with nearly perfect precision but coming from face ID I have to admit that face ID feels a bit more effortless and joyful plus it doesn't blind you at night as optical finger scanners do one other convenience that I did miss was the raised weight function on the iPhones which is so convenient found this phone you have to press the power button on the side to see your lockscreen oh it might seem like I'm complaining about minor things but those are the things you know remember after using the foam for a few months and ultimately those are things that do matter in the long run what also matters is that the one plus seventy is absolutely killing it in terms of speed and performance the 90 Hertz refresh rate is something I can only compare to a turbine in a car you can have a regular engine but the turbo powered one we have that extra push now I flirted with the thought of switching to a Galaxy S 10 a few weeks into my living with the oneplus 70 but it was hard to go back to a 60 Hertz screen and then interface it felt a bit stuttery and definitely not as weak as fast as this one so why did I even think about switching away from the oneplus if I had to summarize it in three words those would be camera camera and again camera oneplus has gotten almost all of the pieces to a smartphone puzzle except that one now skin tones appear terribly oranjee often times and photos often lack color and vibrancy and it's just a hit or miss experience per video the camera also crops in significantly and in low-light the oneplus is not quite on par with the very best camera phones out there and while I realized that the camera doesn't matter to me most of the time with my nine-to-five office routine the moment I start packing for a trip I started having second thoughts and thinking about switching to a different phone so I can get the best pictures but as much as I love meant not having the stellar camera available on iPhones galaxies and pixels I'm also reminded how much slower those phones are in terms of charging speeds the latest Galaxy Note m+ might recharge in about an hour but not if you're using it while it's on the charger then it takes much much longer and with conventional phones I have to remember to charge my phone at night every single night and with the oneplus 70 I never charge the phone at night I simply don't have to a quick 20 or 30 minute top-up is all I need to get for another day and this has been a huge relief me now finally in terms of battery life the oneplus 70 has been okay it will last me through a day and a bit more on a single charge it's not quite as long lasting as an iPhone 11 from Max that can last me two days easily but it's definitely good enough so I would not complain about it at the end of the day it's time for more travel soon so I might be switching away from the oneplus 70 but it will certainly remain in my luggage as a solid backup phone that I can always go back to it's rare to find a phone that fits you nearly perfectly but the oneplus 70 is pretty much that except the camera so guys this was my quick time with the oneplus 70 my impressions with the phone let me know if you agree with them and if you like the phone
