this is Samsung's big bad boy for 2020 the Galaxy S 20 ultra a phone that will give you everything 5g the best battery life the biggest display a revolutionary camera experience the best performance this phone is an absolute powerhouse I spent a short while with all three new Galaxy S 20 phones and yes 20 Ultra is the one that leads the pack first of all it's not just like any big phone out there it's gigantic the screen is six point nine inches and the phone is much bigger and bulkier than last year's Galaxy S 10 plus if you prefer compact phones you should definitely consider the smaller s 20 and s 20 plus models but if you want a large phone with a large screen you'll love the ultra it's made of glass and metal nothing new here but it still looks the part every bit is premium and luxurious as you'd expect but at least went clean hold it for a while and easily get smudged with fingerprints it launches in just two colors you have a gray and a black or a cosmic grand cosmic black if you have Samsung now I know you want to hear about that revolutionary camera but let me spend just a moment talking about the screen because it is worth it this screen is incredible six point nine inches AMOLED in this latest and most advanced form with a tiny discreet punch hall camera in the center and almost no bezel colors are juicy and delightful especially in the vivid color mode and you also have one killer new feature 120 Hertz refresh rate everything looks buttery smooth and 120 Hertz this refresh rate works even when you lower the brightness samsung tells us it one small disclaimer you can only enable it when using full HD resolution if you want the maximum quad HD resolution 120 Hertz option is not available and no there is no in-between 90 first option at all okay let's address the elephant in the room the revolutionary new cameras see the s20 Ultron person is a bit of a culture shock you have never seen a phone with such an enormous Liebig camera bump it's absolutely massive but there is a reason for that size of new hundred and eight megapixel main camera with the largest sensor ever on the galaxy phone and then three more cameras the ultra wide one in the periscope zoom lens on the bottom that gives you an impressive 10 times optical zoom so you can zoom further without losing much in clarity push to its limits if you zoom up to a mind-boggling hundred times well-deserving the space zoom nicknamed this samsung has given it of course don't expect great quality at a hundred times zoom images do look blurry and you'd better bring a tripod along but step 1 stop short of that at 30 times zoom just holding the phone in your hand and you get a surprisingly decent photo and go at the native 10 times zoom and photos look downright impressive those hundred and eight megapixels on the main camera you can use them for full resolution photos but by default the camera would combine nine individual pixels into one to create 12 megapixel snaps the camera has quite a few other tricks up its sleeve 8k video with stunning detail yes that's an overkill and it takes a ton of space but isn't a phone like the ultra all about that overkill Samsung has also improved the super steady option so we get real gimbal like stabilization so you can run in film and still get buttery smooth recordings you get a new night mode that brings out beautiful colors and pitch black conditions and our favorite the new single take option single take allows you to just hold the camera shutter while the phone will shoot photos and videos with all of the cameras and then magically pull out the best shots in moments in one album how do you use it but first do something fun jump or scream be creative and capture it you automatically get a short movie of you gif like funny animations a bunch of stylized photos and a lot more and just one take samsung says it uses AI but it's a really great way to capture a moment and see it as if it was captured from a crowd of people everyone with their own unique view and they have other cool new features like the night hyperlapse that can capture things like this okay I can easily get carried away talking cameras but here's something super cool about the s20 ultra it has a colossal 5,000 milliamp hour battery bigger than on most other flagships and it will last he also gets fast charging via USB C as well as faster than before wireless charging under the hood the processor powering this show is the brand new monster by qualcomm snapdragon 865 if you live in the state's most other countries will get the Exynos 990 chip which would be close in terms of speed the 5g modem onboard will support both millimeter wave frequencies and sub six bands so you get full compatibility with all carriers and benefit from both technology you also have 128 gigs of on-board storage and an impressive 12 gigabytes of RAM but if you want to go overboard you can also get the s20 ultra with as much as 16 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabytes of storage plus you have micro SD card support to expand further on that there are a few other details you should know about first no headphone jack last year's Galaxy S 10 had it but this year is gone I personally would miss it but Samsung is throwing a pair of its new truly Wireless Galaxy buds plus for free so I can't complain much they now look shiny with a glossy finish and last up to 11 hours of continuous music playback which is super impressive for truly wireless earbuds second the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is built inside the screen and since there is no 3d face recognition here it's the most secure way to unlock your phone it should be improved and we hope it is as it was not quite perfect on the galaxy note 2 M plus but unfortunately I did not get to test it yet third that new live wallpaper looks dope just enjoy that zen-like movement on your lockscreen okay back to reality last the ultra still comes pre-loaded with Microsoft apps like Office onedrive and LinkedIn I don't use them but I don't mind and well that about wraps up this first look at the beastly new Galaxy S 2 an ultra a phone that brings us into a new era of zoom photography and buttery smooth 120 Hertz refresh rates I cannot wait to test that camera in more detail as well as put doto2 our signature battery drain test very soon meanwhile I will be answering your questions
