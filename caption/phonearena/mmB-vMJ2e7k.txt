hey guys it's press and I hear voices in my head no I do not what I have here is the 1+8 it's still it's elegant it's pretty it's not the lightest phone I've used but it's very well balanced which makes it super nice to use with just one hand you'll notice that it has a matte glass bag now the matte finish is nice because it does not collect fingerprint grease as much as glossy finish and also the glass have the benefit of allowing for wireless charging no but the 1+8 pro does also it has the mute switch on the side which allows you to very quickly go into silent or vibrate mode it's an awesome feature that we sure wish we would see on more smart phones there isn't much else to be said about the design it's nice so let's move on to the display the display it's beautiful it's an AMOLED screen and if you like realistic and ground colors you have that if you like punchy AMOLED cover us with cold whites you can also have that actually oneplus goes above and beyond and includes a lot of options and customization for the screen itself you can have vibrancy you can have color adjustment adjustments there are even two separate reading modes one makes the screen black and white the other one makes the screen black and yellowish kind of like real paper or kindle black experience now oneplus has the DC diamond option you know AMOLED screens have this thing where when you go down on brightness the screen starts to flicker it's very fast so you can't see it with a naked eye but some people work as a boots I would like to say a small percentage of customers suffer from headaches when using their AMOLED screens on low brightness for long times now DC dimming fixes that it kind of skews the colors a bit which is why the option is still in better on the want respond but it's still nice to have a nice to see it and of course it only has a 90 Hertz refresh rate screen we've already seen one 120 we've already seen even 144 well rest assured mine hurts still looks quite smooth and very pleasing to the eye when scrolling around and launching apps and whatnot so so nice now on the inside it has a coca Snapdragon 865 and starts up editing the brand yeah yeah yeah you know what you're right you are right we've seen flagship specs in sports before and not always the best result like sometimes the touch input is laggy sometimes it's the screen inaccurate sometimes the haptics are kind of rattley and slow and annoying not the case here so the touch screen is just right it's responsive it feels very nice to use the haptics in this thing the most amazing haptics among the most amazing tactics on a man do is phone yeah except for is also great so very very fast it truly is beyond speed so as you might expect games run fast everything runs great everything apps email browsing YouTube videos even download the apps everything you can rest assured runs pretty smooth now the camera that's a bit of a sore spot for the a1 + 8 it's not bad it makes some good photos sometimes it can even rival the greats like your pixel pores and your galaxy s 20s but it does like to flatten them nameks a bit too much and it does love to amp up colors so sometimes pictures still not weird you can of course check a full comparison with this camera against the iPhone 11 Pro the pixel 4 and the galaxy s 20 poultra and the link here somewhere around this area ok so its main pictures are ok portraits are a bit mad the 1+8 struggles a lot of separating subject from the background and of course in amps of colours and portraits turn out very funny looking it's night mode is impressive though it managed to pull out details from scenes where other forms even struggled so good job there there's no crazy zoom onboard no 13 X or 100x just 10 X and it's purely digital no optical zoom so you won't be using that 10x a lot it becomes grainy very very fast now the second camera it's an ultra wide-angle that's trendy it's calibrated close to the main one so when you switch between the two it doesn't feel jarring the power stones in getting change up and what's really nice in this problem something that not many others do when you start recording even if it's a 4k video you can still switch between between the mainland and the ultra wide lens which is nice it doesn't stop you even if you're shooting an action video everything is in frame pretty cool there's also a third camera another telephoto it's a macro camera for some reason you can go really really close to things and take pictures that would have been nice and cold and everything but it's a 2 megapixel sensor so you don't really get amazing detail or big pictures and you get some noise so I kind of forgot it's there used it a bit that's it now the selfies with the front-facing camera actually look quite detailed I like them a lot sometimes something weird happened to the skin tone but otherwise very detailed very honest even quite good to see and it's speakers were a bit of a letdown I've heard a lot about these speakers they definitely are loud and detailed and don't distort very easily but they do lacking bass so they're kind of harsh great for watching YouTube videos even when you're outside but not so good for enjoying your favorite music [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now the one was ate with his 4300 milliamp hour battery blasted through our but to live test with flying colors it generally kept its screen on for about nine to ten hours depending on the activity and what this should mean for you is that it's kind of capable of two day battery life with Sperry news like some email some texting or YouTube videos but if you're heavier user it can still last your take and even if you need to get to an emergency wall outlet you want the stuck there for long because this thing has a word charger in the box which tops it off very very very very very very very very fast so is the one plus eight worth $700 yeah I think so it starts at 128 gigs which is okay storage it's fast it's nice design it's pretty if you don't care about having the best camera yeah now the one problem it does have is that the iPhone 11 is also in that $700 price range and it comes with a better camera new iOS experience the works okay if you insist on Android there's the pixel 4 and for excel which are regularly discounted nowadays great cameras the Google Android the full support okay Samsung still sells the Garcias 10 for 750 the oneplus 70 it's only a few months old and you can still get it for five hundred dollars from oneplus directly this video is over thanks for watching if you made it this far please comment below the voices are not real please please I need it also subscribe [Music]
