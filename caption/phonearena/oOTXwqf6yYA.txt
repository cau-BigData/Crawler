this year is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 time to unbox it see what it's all about hello guys my name is Vic with phone marina and this is our first look at the no 10 plus now first of all the box itself is quite simple you have the s-pen painted right here in the front so this is the big focus of the note 10 plus series the S Pen and of course it's a premium smartphone so what is in the box the first thing that you see inside the box is of course the phone itself in our case it is the beautiful or a glow finish which changes its shape depending on the way you tilt it and the light it reflects it really is a beautiful premium finish but we'll take a closer look at the phone later on in our unboxing now let's take a look at the accessories that come included in the box and the first thing and the most important one is probably the wall charger we have a 25 watt wall charger here in the box it uses USB C to connect so it's a USB C to USB C connection you have a USB C to USBC cable as well it's slightly bigger than before but still not huge by any means it's very lightweight and in our case it's also painted in black in terms of other accessories you also have a pair of USB C headphones these are in ear headphones tuned by AKG and they feel very comfortable its first looked you also have a few different tips that you can change so they you can get a better fit in your ear and you also have a couple of accessories for the s-band you have two tips two different tips in different colors and a pair of tweezers so you can easily take those tips and change them what else you have in the Box you have a sim ejector too of course this is easy to apply on the note 10 plus itself you have a screen protector and the last thing that you have in the box is a pair of adapters so you have a full USB type A or regular USB to USB C and you also have a micro USB to USB C connection so these are useful here trying to upload data or transfer data from another device so that's about everything that you have the box here it's a pretty rich set of accessories you don't have a case in the box but apart from that you pretty much get everything else so let's now take a closer look at the note M plus itself so the note M plus itself is a big phone it's about as big as the 1 plus 7 Pro you if you've held that phone and it's a large phone but it looks beautiful features those signature square shape corners they're not as round it is on the s10 so it definitely has its character it's a premium phone you have the Snapdragon 805 5 chip in the US version and international models will ship with the Samsung made Exynos chip you have a beautiful 6.8 inch display here it's an AMOLED screen made by Samsung the best of the best gets really bright and direct sunlight and of course you have the latest version of Samsung 1 UI samsung 1 UI version 1.5 which is more refined now has more on items closer to the reach and the bottom part of the screen the big focus the camera again you have the s-pen that works with a few new camera features like a our doodle you can just scribble on top of yourself and get some really from instagram / snapchat kind of effects that you can share with your friends this is a fun gimmick gimmick but a fun one and what else you have a big battery and you have a lot more features that we'll cover in our full review that's coming up soon so stay tuned for that my name is Vic christophe those pleasure talking to you i'll see you next time right here on phone arena
