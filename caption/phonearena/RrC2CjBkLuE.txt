best Unreal Engine 4 games for Android and iOS Unreal Engine 5 was demoed a few days ago but it will be a while before games built with it grace our smartphones until then however we can admire the games made with its predecessor Unreal Engine 4 and that is exactly what we have for you today I am Vic with phone arena and this is our compilation of the 10 best Unreal Engine 4 games for Android and iOS although they are built using the same engine the titles on this list are quite diverse in both style and gameplay that being said time to get to the actual games number one bo t in BL t you take control of massive Mac's similar to what you will find in titanfall unsurprisingly your goal is to destroy the max of your enemies while you fight for control of the map the different models have their own strengths and weaknesses and of course you can upgrade them using the in-game currency the game makes full use of the Unreal Engine 4 with detailed mech models and levels one really cool thing is that your Titan takes realistic damage it can disable parts of it for example certain guns that gives a realistic tone to the battle and makes you work harder to pull off a win tirado is a game about one versus one jewels styled in the mix of medieval Japan and the Dark Souls you're fighting your way out of the underworld and that means going through a bunch of literal gatekeepers while the controls might seem very simplistic once you're in battle the gameplay is surprisingly intense so you can barely notice the limited types of attacks you can make there are more than 130 weapons to unlock which have different stats and can be upgraded to become more powerful if you neglect your weapons it will take you forever to defeat enemies later in the game so keep that in mind next up we have mad 8 unlike shadow there is a ton happening all over the place while playing mad eight the number eight relates to the maximum number of hero's you'll be able to control on your quest to defeat enemies and powerful bosses they all have unique abilities that you have to use smartly to overcome the most challenging and bursaries not a fan of playing against mindless AI opponents both try the four versus four player versus player mode to see how good you really are of course equipment is a big part of every RPG and mad is no exception there is a wide variety of weapons and other types of gear that can make your hero stronger and it's all upgradeable next up we have overhead so many anime style games use Unreal Engine 4 we had to include at least one of them and our choice is overhead overhead is an RPG game with awesome graphics and the flashy effects you've come to expect from a game like this assemble a team of heroes from a pool of more than 120 unique characters and use their abilities in a way that makes your lineup stronger than the sum of its parts don't look for realism in this game it's all about being on an epic adventure and defeating fantastical creatures and when it comes to that overhead does a great job next up we have hello neighbor hello neighbor is a very unique game it's cartoony graphics give it a cheerful vibe but these creators describe it as a stealth horror game and they're not wrong the game can feel very intense while you're sneaking around your neighbor's house while he's trying to find you what makes your task more challenging is that the AI controlling the neighbor will adjust based on your behavior this vastly improves the replayability of the game which is not something that can be said for many games of that genre if you like the suspense of the unknown and don't mind being spooked from time to time then you really enjoy hello neighbor there are many popular shooters that use Unreal Engine 4 and you might wonder why they are not on this list most of them we've already included in our other compilations which you should totally check out by the way and we prefer to have a wider variety of titles which is why we've included after post elite army to this list after post is similar to Call of Duty with realistic Special Operations combat scenarios and weapons it offers a nice variety of game modes that even include a co-op challenge mode in which you and the friend can test your skills without the pressure of a full multiplayer match next up we have Mortal Kombat does Mortal Kombat even need an introduction a franchise that taught a whole generation more about the human anatomy than the school biology classes what used to be a red pixelated mess on the screen is now a beautifully rendered symphony of blood and gore and while our smartphones don't have the indestructible arcade controls we could mash to oblivion Mortal Kombat is still satisfying to play and the real eye candy if you're not squeamish and you better be not because the developers have put a lot of effort visualising fatalities in the best possible way next up on this list is life is strange life is strange is a game with depth that few mobile games have the well-thought-out story will have you fully engaged while solving the mystery the main character stumbles upon music voice acting an overall design help you immerse yourself even through the small display of your phone and that's not even the best part the game has multiple endings that you can reach depending on the decisions you make throughout the game of course you have to replay the game to see them all which you gladly do life is strange is not a game to kill time during your commute but rather to enjoy on a gloomy Sunday next up we have injustice to injustice - is another fighting game but with character is even more popular than those of Mortal Kombat Superman Batman the flash Wonder Woman just a few of the DCU verse characters you'll be able to recruit and take control of some of your favorite villains like the Joker are here too of course assemble a team of three and get into the fray complete challenges to rank globally or fight against other players in the PvP mode the choice is yours upgrades and unlockables haven't skipped that game your heroes will only get stronger as you play along and finally we have darkness Rises darkness Rises is a game that's truly worthy of the console experience title the graphics and play style are reminiscent of God of War with some extra badass finishing moves to make you feel like you're really kicking ass in darkness Rises however you can choose from four classes each with its own abilities strengths and weaknesses and you can even customize the looks of your character for that extra personal touch the epic bosses will put your skills to the test and if they get you sweating too much you can always raid a dungeon or face off against other players oh and did we mention you can also write dragons because you totally can in this game and on that high note it's time to end this video we hope you liked our picks and the games will bring you hours of fun my name
