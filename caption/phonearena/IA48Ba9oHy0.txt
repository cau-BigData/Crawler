Apple's long-awaited iPhone as he was finally announced last week succeeding the once popular but now quite old original HD model that was released way back in 2016 with powerful internals and the knife Oh neat like design $400 Damacy Jesus Christ relatively low for the number of teachers it offers and currently few phones could match the new iPhone se in terms of pricing and those very same features but if there is one that will that one would be a device that has not even been officially announced yet but has leaked out so much if we know almost everything about it before the announcement and that is the Google pixel for a hello guys my name is Vic with phone arena but before I tell you how Google's next affordable device shapes it to be a match for the iPhone se let me inform you that right now Best Buy is running the killer deal on the already available pixel for series and you can buy them at a discount of as much as two hundred and fifty dollars the affordable pixel 3a is also on sale and up for the live in $50 off check out the description for the links to these amazing deals and with this in mind let's see how the upcoming pixel for a compares against the new iPhone se first design and that's where the iPhone issue takes a step back follow the iPhone 8 design cues to the letter with a fashionable glass design and an aluminum frame but also those big bezels touch ID is not bad at least for the foreseeable future as the new iPhone se brings back the glorious days of fingerprint scanning on iOS the pixel for a on the other hand has leaked out with a beautiful nearly bezel-less screen that looks more contemporary at the same time while the iPhone is made of premium materials the pixel for a shapes up to be made of plastic which many don't mind but it certainly doesn't feel as nice to hold and yes the for a were also use a fingerprint scanner for security but it will be placed on its back and not the front like the iPhone there is also difference in the screen technology and that one is in favor the pixel for a that was newest iPhone se the good old 4.7 inch LCD display in use since the iPhone 6 in 2014 yes it has learned a few new tricks it has true tones that have just colors to your environment we also support dolby vision HDR 10 for richer colors if you watch netflix but it's not an oled screen which means that colors will not be as rich and vibrant and blacks will not look so deep and the pixel for a will have an OLED screen it will also have a bigger screen 5 point 81 inches in a higher full HD resolution so text she doesn't look pixelized and next in terms of performance the iPhone se comes with the flagship great fo a 13 Bionic ship the same one is in Apple's latest iPhones on the other hand leaks suggest that sitting inside the pixel for a would be the Snapdragon 730 chip this ship has already been used devices like the Samsung Galaxy 71 it's clearly not a match for grade 13 but just to get the job done the iPhone also comes with three gigabytes of RAM on that while the pixel for a ship to have 4 gigabytes of RAM which is a bit more now keep in mind though that numbers are not everything is aiways optimizes ram differently from android but still pixel has the advantage but the real fight between these two will be in one area both of them are way above the competition that's the camera no other $400 forms and Maggie is still on the camera front not even close the iPhone se 2020 Edition comes with a single 12 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization thanks to an upgraded image signal processor and the neuro engine of the upgraded chipset here Apple says this is the best single camera system it has ever made it now supports portrait mode smart AJR for photos extend the dynamic range for videos and stereo sound recording to the pixel for a on the other hand also touts a single 12 megapixel camera with OAS and improved night mold and videography or reportedly on the way as well as the new pixel we add 4k video recording to its arsenal leaks suggest the pixel will still prevail in low-light photos while we expect the iPhone to do better for video recording next we have two numbers 1800 milliamp hours versus 3100 milliamp hours these are the battery numbers that future buyers would see on the spec sheet and the bigger one belongs to the pixel meaning that it should also have better battery life than the iPhone which is good right and one area where iPhones are way behind is charging the new AC is no exception as it comes with a slow 5 watt charger in the box and you need to buy separately on 18 watts fast charger it supports it but you have to buy separately while with the pixel for a you get that 18 watt charger included for free in the box but then the new IC also supports wireless charging the feature that will likely end up missing on the pixel for a finally needed the iPhone nor the pixel will support 5g connectivity but they will still have plenty fast 4G LTE connections at the end of the day these two shape up to be the best $400 falls in 2020 the pixel for a is expected to be released in May 2020 in just two one size just like the new iPhone se so that's it for our early early comparison between these two which one would you go for the pixel with is bezel design rich AMOLED screen and my tied camera or the iPhone with flagship performance iOS and best-in-class camera for video recording you'll let us know in the comments make sure to also stay safe my name is Vic I hope you enjoyed watching this video as much as I enjoyed making it and
