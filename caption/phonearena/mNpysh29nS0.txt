this charger can deliver 45 watts of power to your Galaxy is 2002 and charges a lot faster than the adapter you get in the box but what is the difference in real life and should you spend $50 on it hello guys my name is Rick with phone arena and today we explored the best way to charge up a Galaxy S 20 ultra and we have lined up three chargers for this test the first one is what we just mentioned the 50 dollar super fast charger it delivers 45 watts of power the second one is the charger that comes in the box with the galaxy s 20 ultra and it can deliver 25 watts of power and finally the third one might be the most convenient one has use no cables but it is also the slowest and most expensive of them all and it is the $80 Samsung wireless charging stand and it delivers 15 watts of power so we have the s20 ultra and all three chargers the falls are completely drained and will be recharging them up to a hundred percent level we're kicking off this test and we'll be checking the progress on 15-minute intervals and give you updates and our first check point is 15 minutes after the beginning the powerful 45 watt charger pulls ahead slightly as it has already charged up the phone to 37 percent e 25 watt charger in the box is not much slower and it is juiced up the phone to 35 percent while the wireless charger is clearly way slower at only 11 percent we're expecting bigger differences at the start but let's keep on going and do another check 30 minutes after the beginning of the test and now finally the 45 watt superfast charger proves it's worth as it has already delivered a 72 percent charge compared to just 62 percent on the charger in the box and nearly 28 percent on the wireless charger if you don't like charging your phone overnight and just want to give it a quick 30 minute top up in the morning or at lunch it makes sense to consider purchasing the 45 watt superfast charger and our next check is at 45 minutes into the test the superfast charger has now topped up the s20 ultra to 93 percent compared to 87 percent on the standard charger just 45% on the wireless charger you can see that the difference between the super fast charger and the standard one has been reduced but still the 45 watt charger it has a slight advantage and even before a full hour 57 minutes into the test the 45 watt superfast charger has already completed the 100% charge and it wins this let's see how long the other two will take to do the same job we do our routine check at one hour and the standard charger is already at 96% while the wireless charger has gotten to 61% it takes just a few more moments and one hour in three minutes since the beginning of the test the standard 25 watt charger also reaches a 400% charge we have run this test a couple of times and every time we get slightly different results and at times the 45 watt and the 25 watt chargers have even finished at the same time so if you're looking for the time it takes to a full hundred percent charge it really doesn't make sense purchasing the 45 watt charger the difference is minimal if any where it does provide a bit of a boost is for those 20 minutes or half an hour tops as for the wireless charger we do two more checks at one hour and 15 minutes when it has 77% on the battery meter and then one more time again at an hour and a half when it delivers a 92% charge and for a full 100% charge you need to wait for an hour and 45 minutes with it longer than on the others this might seem slow when compared with the other two but many other phones like the iPhone and the Google pixel take about the same time to fully charge even with the cable and you do have a gigantic 5,000 milliamp hour battery to top-up on the ultra in either case here is a recap of this test and how much time each charger took the 45 watt charger is slightly faster than the others with the difference most pronounced for quick 30-minute top ups but not for much else if you're not after every single minute of speed you will be perfectly happy with a 25 watt charger in the box and that one is actually much smaller and easier you carry around the wireless charger also did a good job and charge the phone quickly for what it is and there you have it you don't know the exact charging speeds of each of those chargers are you getting one of them for yes to an ultra and what do you think about Samsung's new flagship let me know in the comments feel free to also ask any questions and this will do it for this video my name is Vic this is phone arena subscribe if you want to see more from us and I will talk to you in the next one
