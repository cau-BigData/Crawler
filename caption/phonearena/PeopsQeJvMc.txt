to seven-inch flagships walk into a bar and phone arenas galaxies to any ultra versus note m+ Pro begins can there be a winner given that Samsung isn't targeting the s20 ultra towards note 10 owners it's complicated but the note has twice the base storage and a stylus to fight off any heretic thoughts about splurging three Benjamins extra for the ultra with nominally the s20 altra display slightly larger than the six point eight incher of the note m+ but since it employs a taller aspect ratio the square inch surface area above this place is basically the same the total display of the ultra however brings about a narrower body making the phone slightly easier to hold and operate with one hand in the note if we can talk about ease of handling with phones that are bordering on the 7-inch mark that is plus the s20 model is heavier to balance especially with a case tone and more comfortable in pockets it's also more cumbersome to use with gesture navigation as its displayed less curved on the side then the note and the stock screen protector edges get in the way too thankfully Samsung has a setting to increase the back swipe sensitivity with a case otherwise the raised lip gets in the way even worse than the screen protector speaking of the pre-installed display film it gets dinged and scuffed pretty easily on both phones but better than the expensive screens themselves for all other practical purposes the galaxy ace training ultra and Note m+ employ the best that the OLED display technology can offer when it comes to contrast and standard gamut or rich color representation the combination of record-low mirror reflections and peak brightness levels makes them the best error at outdoor sunlight visibility as well the maximum power consumption of the displays is slightly high on the note though which should positively reflect on the s20 ultra outdoorsy battery life in comparison the camera kit of the s20 ultra is second to none when it comes to respects yet note m+ stands its ground when it comes to picture quality the ultras main advantage over the note camera are the levels of detail and lossless zooming distance it is able to achieve as you can see in the comparison samples here its photos exhibit better white balance with truer to scene but colder in comparison to the note 10 colors and high contrast people like warmer colors though so some would prefer the notes Zod's moreover when showing people the ultras algorithms are trained to emphasize faces by brightening the shot and artificially smoothing the skin service while the notes camera software keeps things looking more natural in those scenarios well zooming with the Ultra returns way better detail and sharpness indeed up to 10 times lossless while the note maxes out at two times telephoto the arch also has a slight edge in low-light predominantly with the detail and bright highlights yet the note m+ is one of the best on camera performance at night - flipping the falls over and shooting a front camera comparison returns mixed results granted the s20 ultra has an amazing 40 megapixel sensor that resolves a greater amount of detail in its 10 megapixel binning mode and can shoot excellent well lit portraits sometimes however note 10 plus delivers the more balanced selfies while on the ultra they're overexposed and the skin imperfections fixed a bit too aggressively just like it's software does with the rear cameras when it comes to video recording the ultra definitely has the upper hand though be it only for the ability to do 8k definition or to employ a usable five times room while recording footage for all intents and purposes however the video stabilization the details and smoothness are top-notch on both phones and very close if we compare the most used mode 1080p at 30 frames per second the color credibility round here goes to the ultra again with its less visually appealing but more natural colors and white balance presentation the phone's record excellent stereo audio while shooting video but the sound play background goes to the ultras deeper more impressive speaker output this is the wide angle and this is the wide angle video zippedy running the latest samson interface and android edition the galaxy s training ultra and note 10 + strike the fine balance between a feature-rich interface and the notorious core Android smoothness turn on the motion smoothness display option of the s-plane ultra and the ability of its screen to reflash at 120 Hertz immediately puts it abreast of the note for a battery life here that is but something's gotta give the note however it turns the ball with the versatility of its S Pen Stylus that can now not only do though select or annotate but also execute commands from afar thankfully you no longer have to download a separate app to activate rich navigation gestures as Samsung has baked them into the s20 Ultra interface settings another advantage is the quick share menu that it's easier to use than the notes current direct share for fast file swaps all be both transfer with the same speed with up to 16 gigs of ram and a snapdragon 865 processor the new galaxy has an edge before you 855 and 12 gigs of ram set of the note but it's on paper has both performed admirably in males benchmarks and in real life Samsung's to put a forty three hundred million people to support the note 10 plus 4.5 million pixels all the wild Chinese Chinese flag ships are at larger packs pushing 30% less screen dots and the wisdom is on display in our battery benchmarks for the s20 ultra however Samsung woke up from its slumber and used a new packaging technology to stop the largest 5000 million pure butter it has ever placed in a flagship it had to if it wanted to support the double whammy of 5g connectivity and a huge 120 hertz display that extra juice results in longer endurance albeit not drastically so and if you keep things at 120 Hertz the battery life may even drop a tad below the note 10 plus usage on the other hand the ultra takes less than an hour to charge with its huge battery even with the stock 25 volt brick in the box still the high-res displays prevent the two phones from being at the top of the battery life back among the peers and some slowly setting realistic expectations by saying that there they betray phones rather than over-promising set the interface to dark mode bid at four G person and use the default display resolution in refresh rate and not only will the s20 ultra battery life be the best out of any Samsung flagship so far but you may just stretch it well into the next day to being the two most gigantic and wellspect Android phones around put Samsung's current finest in a market niche of their own at 1400 for the ultra the contest seems stacked in favor of the cheaper note which starts off at double the storage and has the s-pen the tangible advantages before the note that the s20 ultra brings to the table though crazy image detail and lossless zoom levels longer battery life or smoother 120 Hertz scrolling are largely worth the price premium over the note 10 plus 5 G but not the 4G model especially if you find a promo granted the amount of detail that the hundred and eight megapixel camera of the s20 ultra captures and the crazy zoom levels are unmatched yet the note 10 plastics very good photos in all scenarios that matter to this was a phoner in a video comparison of the galaxy s 20 ultra and note 10 plus monsters stay tuned for more around Samsung's best phone today [Music]
