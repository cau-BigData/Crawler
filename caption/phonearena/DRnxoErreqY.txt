hey guys I'm press and this is the 1 plus 8 Pro Oh No as 1 plus 8 wait a second now this is the 1 plus 8 Pro gotcha hits the one plus eight again now no joke this is the 1 plus 8 Pro the most ambitious form 1 plus has made this far it starts at $900 and it aims to give competing flagships a run for their money in terms of performance build and camera quality the 1 plus 8 Pro is pretty to look at with the 20 curve display and a nerd curve on the back which makes it more economic the glass panel on the back is matte now so goodbye fingerprint grease smudges the phone does feel a bit on the chunky side it's just a tad thick and a bit heavy the camera module on the back sticks out considerably and you will definitely jab your finger into it often if you don't use the phone with a case that is all that said certainly a pretty phone - look at the screen on the front is a beauty to behold oneplus 2 uses AMOLED panels with super accurate colors but you can fine-tune it to your liking with a ton of sliders and color profiles to pick from it supports a 120 Hertz refresh rate and the animations are super smooth and super fast it also helps that the powerful harbours mixed with the light software really make this thing fly one feature that is exclusive to the 1 + 8 pro is the so-called comfort zone just like two-tone on the iPhones the 1 + 8 Pro will analyze the ambient lighting around you and fine-tune the screens temperature to match and give you a viewing experience that's more pleasing to the eye considering that this thing shares Hubble with the regular 1 + 8 it's kind of a bummer that comfort zone is only available on the pro but ok 1 + ok when the 1 + 8 Pro truly shines is the camera it has a forty eight megapixel main camera 48 megapixel ultra wide camera and then eight megapixel telephoto camera which does provide three times optical zoom with photo quality from the 1+8 pro is truly great with sharp details amazing handling of dynamics and mostly accurate colors sometimes it does slip up and either over saturates something or skews the color away from reality but in general it's an amazing camera and it can hold its own against other more expensive flagships on the market the ultra wide-angle camera is color calibrated to match the main camera not perfectly so but still when you switch to it you don't jump into an entirely different reality portrait shots taken with the telephoto camera are great I was a bit skeptical when I saw that it was only 8 megapixels under lens but that skepticism evaporated as soon as I saw the great subject isolation a tone of contrast and drama and a good amount of detail in the portrait pictures and the SES yes there is a fourth camera on the you wanto city pro it has a different color lens and one plus closet follicle in reality it gives us photos work almost everything is greyish and certain fabrics or colors come out orangish it seems like it's a lens that doesn't filter out infrared light some tech founders have found out that it can see through some plastics but I tried it with everything in my house and I couldn't replicate the same x-ray effect in other words if you're hoping to buy this and get an x-ray form no don't you can't the speaker's only want tosay Pro are on the good side they are very loud very detailed and they do not distort even at max volume they do lack a little bit of bass so they sound a bit harsh to me but otherwise they are good speakers the battery life on this thing is fantastic it crushed our battery tests giving us a stable 9 to 10 hour usage this is replicated in real life as you can almost hit 2 days of battery life sparing years of course should you need to charge up fast the work charger can give you 40 percent of battery in just 20 minutes so that's pretty amazing so that about wraps it up in a neat little bow the 1+8 pro is a fantastic device which is still a bit costly but in the current market it's a fair asking price especially considering that this thing is 5g ready now if you happen to live on the patch of land which has 5g connectivity great for you for the rest of the world this is the type of future proofing which maybe doesn't really matter right now should you buy it I definitely want to refrain from not telling you that you shouldn't that's it from me there's a subscribe button down there if you like what you saw there's a comment section if you want to tell me you hate me or if you lazy there a like and dislike button down here as well so see you next time maybe probably who knows
