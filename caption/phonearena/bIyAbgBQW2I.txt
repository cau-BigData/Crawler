this is it guys the Galaxy Note 10 is coming and this is the first massive leak of the new handset by Samsung and this year there will be two new Galaxy Note 10 miles the Galaxy Note tank Pro and the non Pro version so what are the differences what is it all about my name is Vic Christophe with phone marina and let's dive right in and the first thing that you see is yes that headphone jack is gone the information by the way from this video is coming from only it's a very reliable leak sir that has lead the Galaxy Note 9 last year at about the same time and this year he's added again and the Galaxy Note 10 and the North empro will not feature a headphone jack bad news for all those people that loved Samsung phones because of their versatility because of the micro SD card slot the headphone jack so the micro SD card slot is likely to stay but the headphone jack is gone and the other thing that is gone is the big V button at least according to these early leaks so big button will miss it not really actually the big button was always getting in the way it was always mistakenly pressed so we're happy that it's gone interestingly on these leaked renders the power button and actually all the physical buttons of the no.10 Pro and the no 10 are on the left-hand side and there are no buttons on the right which is kind of strange previously Samsung phones have had their power button on the right so you can easily press it with your thumb and the volume keys were on the left and now all the buttons are seemingly on the left hand side which is a very strange decision but apart from that what does the Galaxy Note enteral look like well it's a very edgy phone it's very sharp and like the Galaxy S 10 which has rounded corners here this one is very sharp and what else we're getting a big phone of course and the note 10 pro is the bigger one it has a six-point 75 inch AMOLED screen while the Galaxy Note and the non pro version who have a smaller more compact size and a 6.3 inch display both of these are Super AMOLED the typical gorgeous Samsung displays with a quad HD resolution illusion and of course you should be able to get versions with up to 12 gigabytes of RAM on board and a lot of storage possibly 512 gigabytes of on-board storage on the top model the new thing here is support for ufs 3.0 faster storage that means movies will load faster games will load faster and the phone overall work faster but will it get the brand-new 90 Hertz flashy feature that makes your phone appear to run much smoother we've seen that on the oneplus 7 pro we're not so sure about the Galaxy Note 10.1 XT hers display but we're yet to see let's look at the back we have four cameras on the Galaxy Note temporal Edition and three cameras on the regular ngon pro version now the fourth camera the one that is extra on the pro version is actually a depth camera time-of-flight camera as they call them and the other three is the same setup that we've seen in the s10 series you have the main 12 megapixel camera you have the ultra wide-angle camera and you have the 2 x telephoto zoom lens and that's about it on the front you still have a punch hole design but this time around you see that the punch hole is right smack in the middle on the top of the phone it's very delicate it doesn't get in the way that much it looks symmetrical it looks good so that's it and you see also see that the bezels are again smaller than before definitely smaller than on the note 9 but the pro version the Samsung Galaxy Note and probably have even slimmer bezels than the non pro version so this is another advantage of the pro model now speaking of price these will be expensive rumors say that the new numb note 10 pro will have support for 5g networks and it will likely cost 10% to 20% more than the previous versions and rumors say that it might start at $1,100 this is not confirmed yet so take it with the proverbial grain of salt but this is one opportunity so what else do we have here we have a change in the processor now in the u.s. no change you still the Snapdragon 855 chip on both these models but in other markets you have a new Exynos chip on board is the 9825 built on a seven nanometer process which means it will be faster it will heat less it will be an overall more reliable performance and more comparable to the Snapdragon 855 version and that's it guys a quick overview of all the leaks and rumors this one big league that has just come out about the note 10 Pro and the note and the phone is expected to be announced in early August and some people are saying to be the 10th of August three years to see about that that's it guys it's a quick overview let me know what you think about the Galaxy Note and pro the Galaxy Note then are you planning on getting these devices how do they compare against some newer phones like the 1 + 7 Pro for example or the iPhones what do you think about that let me know in the comments really curious to hear about your thoughts my name is Vic Christophe with fond arena and I'll see you next time you
