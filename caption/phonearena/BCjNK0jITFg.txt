hey this is rather with phone Reena and you're watching her Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus video review Samsung completely reinvented its flagship smartphone last year with the galaxy s 8 NS 8 plus as it not only came up with the superb infinity display design but also thoroughly reworked its user interface to look in work better understandably this year the company's holding onto this strong foundation and is looking to polish the experience even further without many surface level changes the galaxy s 9 and s time plus look and feel the same as their predecessors who ever did to bring some really welcome improvements to exactly those areas that needed the most you can easily mistake the s 9 for an S 8 because the two models look almost identical there are a few interesting differences though like slightly livelier blue and lilac color variants as well as a metal frame that is no longer highly polished but more like in the middle between matte and glossy if you take a look at the back though you'll find a substantial difference the fingerprint scanner has been moved to a much more convenient position below the camera the galaxy s 9s time plus continues to be one of the best-looking phones on the market they are extremely elegant and classy one year later samsung's new design continues to be just as impressive the screens of the s9 in s 9th plus are technically curved but the curve is now so small that it serves no practical purpose its main benefit is that it probably allows Samsung to create a narrower and more elegant design size and resolution wise things are unchanged from last year the smaller galaxy s 9 has a 5.8 inch display while the s 9 plus has a 6.2 inch display both panels use a very high resolution 1440 by 20 960 pixels the screens are a joy to look at texting graphics are very sharp colors are clear and vivid but it may be smart to use some of the included display color modes to get a more natural looking image a big first for the Galaxy series the stereo speakers found on the s9 and s9 + just like on the iPhone one is positioned on the bottom while the other is the earpiece Samsung has done a great job here as the new stereo speakers sound pretty much as good as those on the newest iPhones which is to say they're industry-leading with the new speakers we're sure that media like games or YouTube video will be that much more enjoyable so this one has been known by many names TouchWiz nature UX grace UX Samsung experience and it's been loved and hated for almost a hundred years liked or not though Samsung's custom Android software has reached a very mature form where it offers a nice unique and elegant UI design sufficient animation and playfulness as well as a plethora of unique features some of which actually useful that said aside from a very few minor graphics changes the UI very much looks like what you can find on the galaxy s 8 there are some interesting new features though Bigsby is being upgraded with new capabilities and Samsung seems particularly proud of its live translation feature where you just point the camera at the foreign language text and bigsby returns a rough translation it's far from perfect but it's definitely better than nothing notable is the new intelligent scan of the indication system while both face detection and iris can ink are said to have been enhanced somewhat intelligent scan combines the two technologies to form a faster and more reliable biometric and locking system it definitely works better than any of the two other options alone and is almost very reliable whoever low-light conditions may significantly slow down intelligence can and it's not expected to be super secure it's a good upgrade but not quite face ID yet performance wise this should be one of the fastest phones ever and for the most part it is things move quickly without hiccups the s9 has four gigabytes of RAM which is already a good amount but the s-line plus decreases that to six gigabytes which is totally future-proof in terms of chipsets the situation doesn't change from previous years where the US version gets a Snapdragon processor in this case the 845 while international markets will enjoy the slightly more popular Exynos 9810 according to some benchmarks we've run into our own personal experience when playing games on the excellence part as 7-series the phone's perform well as expected perhaps leading the market for Android but they are not iphones yet especially the 3d graphics performance leaves a lot to be desired storage is set at 64 gigabytes and that's the variant that will probably be the most widespread certain individual markets may get at 128 gigabyte version but also ways seemed to be quite elusive in a way 64 gigs of internal memory a pretty good plus there's also the option to use a micro SD card for media storage it's easy to tell that a lot of Samsung's focus has been on improving the camera performance not that it wasn't superb on the galaxy s 8 ds9 and s9 + are the first phones to come with variable aperture that can switch between F 2.4 for brighter environments and F 1.5 for low-light scenes this allows the s 9 + s 9 + capture more light when needed however we didn't find its results to be too different from those of the galaxy s 8 actually the difference is hardly there the new model keeps the slightly warmer color profile of its processor but isn't as aggressive with sharpening as a result s9 pictures look a bit softer and have slightly less noise but otherwise they're mostly comparable to the previous generation the bigger upgrade is on the s9 + which gets the dual camera setup from the note 8 the secondary camera is again a telephoto lens which allows you to do 2 times zoom in without quality loss and also to take some very good-looking portraits they are emoji is a big new feature living inside the camera app with it you can take a picture of yourself in it to generate an animated three avatar that can be further personalized to look a bit more like you you can then play with it in real time like a pose an emoji and record video with it but the cool part is it automatically generates stickers from the 3d avatar which can be then used in different messaging apps and are correctly seen on the other end of the conversation this is a superb feature but still a bit underdeveloped as all 3d avatars kind of look similar and real-time animations are somewhat stiff and limited with identically sized bodies Samsung couldn't fit bigger batteries in this year's assign a sign plus as a result their capacities remain identical at 3000 milliamp hours for the s9 and 3500 milliamp hours for the s9 + unfortunately our battery test results show us a shorter battery life compared to last year's Galaxy s8 line the s9 managed to run the test continuously for seven hours and 23 minutes while the s9 + did so for seven hours in eight minutes so the s8 Energy Plus results from a year ago are both hired by about an hour however this kind of longevity is in any case more than enough to get you through the day so you wouldn't worry that much about it with the now or more or an hour less it would still be best to charge nightly at this point thankfully Samsung concludes its awesome adaptive fast charger in the box with its flagships so this guarantees your phone will be up and running in no time both the Galaxy S line an STM plus charge from 0 to 100% in about an hour and 45 minutes about 5 minutes more than the s8 series and of course there is also wireless charging if you'd like to invest in a charging pad the galaxy s 9s time plus our settle upgrades to last year's s8 line the most significant improvements are felt in the fingerprint scanner position the new intelligent face scan feature the AR emoji 3d avatar and the camera but only for the s lines plus in any case if you're a current Galaxy s8 user will say that an upgrade would be completely unnecessary but that's expected for owners of other devices like the s7 or s6 the Galaxy S 9 will feel like a major step forward Samson has once again managed to crop desirable handsets with s 9 NS 9 plus one can how to find anything remotely elegant its advanced and is polished all in a single product on the android market the closest it gets to that is the LGP 30 or google pixel - but each of these has certain drawbacks that position them a step below Samsung's impressive package the only real alternative if you're on the market for a powerful and good-looking phone that's also a great overall product are of course Apple's iPhones and that is a whole other story thank you for watching whole Riina's Galaxy S 9 + S time + video review if you'd like to dive into even more detail will suggest that you take
