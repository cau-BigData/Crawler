this right here is the brand new iPad 720 19 Edition the most affordable iPad and Apple's lineup hello guys Vic here with phone marina let's take a look at this new tablet and what's actually knew about it so first of all this is what the box looks like have a space gray color color matched Apple logo so Apple calls is the new iPad 7 generation between there is very little new about it let's open the box so there you have it the new 2019 Edition the seven generation iPad so let's take the plastic and as a starting up let's take a closer look at what's inside the box you have a standard USB to lightning cable we have the user manuals typical literature and Apple stickers and the familiar 12 watt charger that you can also use for your iPhones to charge it a little bit faster so that's a new iPad 2019 Edition the most affordable tablet in Apple's lineup starting in the price of just 330 dollars for the Wi-Fi only model and this comes with just 32 gigs of on-board storage so what's new about it well first of all is the screen it's a 10.2 inch high-resolution display it is a little bit bigger than the nine point seven inch screen that we used to have before so inside that you have the old Depot a tank fusion chip which is the same chip that the company used way back with the iPhone 7 had the most powerful thing around so let's take a closer look at the tablet itself here on the top we have a headphone jack which is a nice change considering recent Apple products that the power key on the top you have the volume buttons on the side you also have touch ID on the bottom so this phone does support fingerprint scanners through security and you do have the same large bezels here so this is enough not as the futuristic or modern looking as your iPad pro but definitely it still looks relevant I would say some things haven't changed for example on the front is to have a 1 megapixel camera which is a very resolution and of course this processor is a big drawback Apple really knows what it's doing with this tablet here you have the more expensive $400 iPad Mini which features the new your Apple a 12 chip and if you want a big tablet with the relevant processor you have the app the iPad air so the worse New Year is basically is just an update in terms of screen size and you also get that magnetic connector so that means that you can connect Apple smart Keyboard to this thing but again the smart Keyboard costs one hundred and fifty dollars so this is half the price of the tablet itself so would you really consider buying it for such an affordable product we're not so sure and the rest is iOS 13 is 13 features a ton of new features the dock is here for food multitasking and this can really be a bit of a replacement for your PC and if you want the most affordable the budget iPad this is the one to get but if you want something more powerful maybe you should consider the iPad Mini with the more powerful processor or the iPad air which cost a little bit more but give you that edge in terms of performance and this thing will probably feel bit on the slow side in just a couple of years but right now for browsing the web for watching Netflix it's definitely sufficient so this are a quick look at the iPad 2019 7j narration starting at the price of three hundred and thirty dollars now available let me know what you think about in the comments right below my name is vicky and i'll talk to you next time [Music]
