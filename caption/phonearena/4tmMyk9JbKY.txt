hey guys Nick with phone arena here and this is a quick review of the official Samsung cases for the galaxy s 20s 20 plus and s 20 eltra I'm gonna start with Samsung's official leather case because it's one of my favorites it is made of genuine leather so it looks and feels quite fancy the surface is soft and nice to the touch though I must say that some of my colleagues find it a very slippery in their hands the volume and power buttons on the side are easy to feel at the bottom there is a big cutout that makes gesture navigation more comfortable keep in mind that this case is light and thin so don't expect it to stop a bullet it is mostly made to look pretty and to protect against scratches speaking of scratches one of the weaknesses of this case is that it's guaranteed to wear out over time the surface will degrade as it erupts against your pockets but this is what happens with every other leather case finally I think this case provides adequate protection for the camera of my Galaxy S 20 but several people on Samsung's website point out that it doesn't protect the larger camera on the galaxy s 20 ultra very well so that's something to keep in mind okay moving on to something a bit tougher this is the most rugged case that Samsung has for the Galaxy S 20 I cannot call it beautiful but it's not meant to be this is a thick and bulky case mostly made of solid plastic and it's actually kind of difficult to take on and off but it feels tough the sights are soft and creepy and the buttons are well exposed there is a thick raised lip around the edges of the screen it is there for extra protection but it also gets in the way of gesture navigation a key selling point with this case is the dual kickstand at the back you can prop up the phone while watching video for example the two kickstand supports the phone at two different angles however people on Samsung's website who also have this case say that the kickstand are prone to breaking off probably because they're made of plastic but I haven't had any issues with them so far finally I can confirm that the phone charges wirelessly even with the case on reverse wireless charging also works fine I believe this next case is one you will either love or hate it is a thin and light case that is easy to put on or take off the buttons on the side feel okay to use and there is a large cutout at the bottom for gesture navigation the outer side is made of fabric and I think this material isn't a bad choice because it feels different and kind of special but at the same time the texture is a bit rough some people don't find the feeling of it very pleasant and it could be difficult to keep clean judging by my experience with previous fabric Samsung cases by the way this fabric is made entirely out of recycled plastic bottles which i think is kind of cool in conclusion you should check out this case if you are into unusual non mainstream stuff this is the official silicone case for the galaxy s 20 and it's exactly what you'd expect it to be it is light and thin so it doesn't add much weight to the phone it is also easy to take on and off when that's needed the buttons on the side are easy to feel and again we see a big cutout at the bottom for more comfortable navigation the surface of the case has average grip probably not as much as I expected but I think it's OK in this regard you don't want a case like this to be too grippy what is a bit annoying is that the case may be hard to keep clean dust and Pocket lint tends to stick to its surface quite easily overall if you want a colorful case providing lightweight protection this one might be worth checking out here is the official transparent case for the galaxy s 20 and it's kind of a mixed bag situation with this one the case is light functional and pretty simple it provides good protection from all sides and protects the corners very well there is a raised lip surrounding the display so that the screen doesn't scratch when it's faced down on a table and the camera at the back seems to be well protected also this case is very cheap I mean it costs less than $15 at mobile phone right now which is great for an official case however it also looks and feels of cheap the material has a bluish tint to it which just doesn't look great on top of that for some reason fingerprints easily stick to the surface of this case and are difficult to clean overall this case gets the job done but to me it just doesn't look good on a thousand-dollar phone okay now here's something different at a glance this looks like a regular case made of hard plastic and I think the pink color is kind of cute but when I put the case on the phone detected it and automatically applied a matching user interface theme to my Galaxy S 20 what's cooler is that there are LEDs embedded in the back of the case so when you put your phone down it makes this study light show for 10 seconds if you want to you can replace this light effect with an animated icon you get LED notifications for incoming calls or messages the case also lights up when you're using the camera and even this place account down if you're using the timer LED effects aside this case feels ok to use you get a cutout at the bottom for easier navigation and the buttons aren't covered so they're easy to use overall the case is quite gimmicky but I am sure there are people who are going to love it this is the official LED wallet cover for the galaxy s 20 on the inside on the cover you get a slot large enough to fit a credit card the surface of the case feels a bit like fabric but it's probably some kind of textured plastic now personally I don't like cases with a flip cover like this one the cover doesn't always stay closed and it gets in the way of everything it's particularly annoying when using the camera but I guess it's useful for protecting the screen if you like to carry your phone in a bag or in a purse Samsung's cover uses LEDs on the outside to display the time when you press the power button of course you get a visual alert when someone's calling and you can pick up or decline the call with a swipe over the LEDs you cannot see the name of the color but you can assign a specific icon to a specific contact or you can even draw a custom icon that can be the initials of the contact overall I think this LED display on the outside can be useful but the digits are not displayed clearly enough three six eight and nine look almost identical and can be mistaken for one another finally here is another galaxy s 20 case with a flip cover again when you have the case on the cover provides extra protection for the display when it's closed and it gets in the way of everything else when it's open this time you do not have a credit card slot on the inside what you do get is a transparent window on the right side of the color even when the cover is closed you can see the time and how much battery you have left if you have new notifications the icons for up to four apps will be displayed although you do not actually see the contents of the notifications you can pick up or decline phone calls without lifting the cover if you have music playing you get access to playback controls so you can quickly pause or skip a song overall if you prefer to carry your phone in a purse this could be the case to consider it is thin and light with white cutouts for the buttons on the side and the gesture navigation area at the bottom thanks for watching our quick review of the official cases for the galaxy s 20 series if you have
