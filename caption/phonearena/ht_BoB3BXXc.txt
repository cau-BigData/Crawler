these are the best story-driven and adventure games that have been released on either Android or iOS in the last couple of years we wanted to include as many great games as possible and there are quite a few that have been launched one or two years ago so without further ado let's check out some great games in the stars at number one gris-gris is one of those games that you won't have trouble understanding because it doesn't use text to tell its story while chris is definitely a story-driven game it sends players on an emotional journey using simple control reminders shaped in the form of universal icons apart from the light puzzles and platforming sequences Grist is a gorgeous game featuring hand-painted visuals in an incredible tale of sorrow and lost experience to the eyes of a young woman grace is a very pretty game that's already been praised by critics and gamers alike so it was probably one of the easiest picks of our selection of curated titles our next big oxen-free is aimed at stranger things fans without being actually a stranger things game itself developed by the fine folks at night school oxen-free is a supernatural mystery graphic adventure game where players step into the shoes of a teenage girl who is visiting a local I want with a group of friends oxen-free is a mix of teen drama and supernatural thriller that has a similar 80s vibe that made stranger things famous it's an absolute must play for those who love a supernatural mystery sin toons and comics like visuals the next game we're going to talk about is a weird one and not just because of the name but mostly because of the gameplay the wonderer Frankenstein's creature is a game co-produced by RT a well known cultural european TV and digital channel it's a different approach to the myth of Frankenstein one that involves you playing as the creature a wanderer with no memory or past who has no notion of good evil depending on the creatures emotions throughout the game the scenery turns into breathtaking or dark gloomy landscapes The Wanderer Frankenstein's is all about visuals and unique atmosphere but the games got some staggering tunes as well Gabriel Knight sins of the fathers is a remake of the classic point-and-click adventure game with the same name released back in 1993 playing Gabriel Knight sins of the fathers is like being the protagonist in a mystery novel written by Agatha Christie only this time you will be solving murders using so-called dumb cursors this means that you have to select the correct cursor for a specific interaction with an object on the screen yes it's a bit more complicated than the context-sensitive cursor in the traditional adventure games which change based on what the cursor is hovering over but it's one of the traits that make Gabriel Knight sense of the feathers rather unique forgotten and is one of the few games on the list with a really charming story the game takes place in a fictional world where lost objects come to life all these objects hold that their owners might remember where they lost them and that they would eventually return to the real world and the protagonists of the game is one of the guardians of the Forgotten lands who must squash a rebellion that might prevent her from returning to the real world aesthetically forgotten and features a hand-drawn animated style but the real PS the resistance is the orchestral score performed by the Copenhagen Philharmonic next up we should talk about M Anita design that's a name it needs no introduction among hardcore gamers this studio has impressive portfolio that includes titles like Machinarium Botanicula pilgrim and Samorost while not the most recent game launched by Amanita design Samorost 3 is one of the studio's best-looking titles the high-definition graphics makes a mirage 3 look gorgeous on both small and larger displays unlike traditional point-and-click adventure games semi rose 3 doesn't feature comprehensible dialogue and the sound recording was created by people making strange noises and microphones if these are not good reasons to place a mirage 3 and made the fact that the game won a handful of important awards might convince some of you to give it a try limbo is the equivalent of a film noir for a gamer developers have used black and white stones to build the dark to neveress landscapes and creatures that roam the world of limbo the excellent use of lighting and film grain effects will probably give you eerie feelings but so does Hitchcock's Psycho and it's still considered one of the best classic horror movies in limbo you'll be controlling a boy through haunting environments by using simple commands like run left or right jump climb in push or pull although limbo does feature solid gameplay mechanics it's an example of games as an art form yes the game is a bit too light on the story but if you have a knack for the horror genre limbo is the perfect way to quench that thirst next up we have never alone an adventure game that allows you to switch between the two main characters a girl and the Fox you will be forced to switch between the two companions to solve puzzles or reach certain areas in the game never alone tells an Alaskan native traditional story it has been shared across generations the game features impressive yet harsh Arctic environments which players must brave to reach at the end of the journey aside from the main story each time players overcome a challenge they will be rewarded with cultural insights for stories told by Alaska Native community members and storytellers if you're not too thrilled about the platforming puzzle gameplay elements you surely love the story never alone sets out to tell next up The Walking Dead is one game probably everyone knows about thanks to the very successful TV series unlike traditional adventure games The Walking Dead trades puzzles for character development and storytelling while there are no puzzles to solve in this game there are surely a lots of QTEs or QuickTime events to execute what makes this game unique for its onra is that every choice you make throughout the game influences the story and carries over to the next episode The Walking Dead is based on the comic book series and consists of 5 episodes as we recommend you check out a similar game when it comes to gameplay the wolf among us tells the story of Bigby wolf a detective who investigates the murder of a woman fans know that this is a prequel to the comic book but here is a quick rundown of the premise if you've never heard about the game just yet the wolf among us is set in a fictional colonial America where inhabitants of the magical lands have fled from us from a mysterious tyrant since they are not human they must use an enchantment called glamour to hide their appearance and yes you most likely recognize many folktale characters like Little Red Riding Hood the woodsman Little Mermaid Bloody Mary in the protagonist the big bad wolf life is strange is yet another story driven episodic graphic adventure that follows the adventure of a young student who discovers that she can rewind time unfortunately every time she changes something in the past she triggers the butterfly effect which means every small change in the initial conditions would result in different outcomes later on if the premise of the game piqued your interest you'll be happy to know that the story is even better and finally the silent age is probably the oldest game on this list so chances are that many have already heard of it it's a point-and-click adventure game set in the dystopian future where mankind has gone extinct you'll be playing a janitor who's trying to save humanity by using time travel the janitor slash time-travel combination is by far the least weird thing about the silent age who just mentioned some other concepts that appear in the game so you get an idea of what to expect communism spies portable time machines cryo chambers in a lot of time traveling now this wraps up our selection of the best story-driven adventure games available right now for Android and iOS let us know which one
