just half a year after the release of the original samsung is back at it with the more refined galaxy watch active to that now finally comes in two sizes looks a lot better and has a few new tricks well the original watch active looked a bit like a toy this second generation is a lot more solid Samsung is offering an aluminum model that we have for review and it costs $300 a full hundred dollars less than your base model a power Series five which you can also get the Samsung watch and a better-looking and more elegant stainless steel version at four hundred and fifty dollars and that one comes paired with a stylish leather band well it has active in its name the watch doesn't look sporty per se it just looks clean with an aluminum body and two physical buttons on the side the back button on the top and the home button on the bottom the look is versatile enough so that you can take it to the gym and also wear it at the office and look good at both places the rotating bezel that was a signature feature Samsung watches is no longer here which might be a good thing because it allowed the watch to be slimmer and more comfortable to wear but on the downside navigation is not quite as easy you swipe and tap on the screen and you have a kind of a replacement for the bezel with software the so-called digital bezel it's a feature that is not turned on by default but once you enable it you can slide your finger over the edge of the watch to scroll through menus and you get a nice little tap when you scroll through lists it's definitely not as precise as the physical rotating bezel but one can get used to it the big news are the sizes the original was a tiny watch and now we have a 40 millimeters smaller size as well as a bigger 44 millimeter one we have the bigger one for review then this is not gigantic but a rather moderate size I was disappointed however to find out that in the box you only get one size strap so for example you get the 40 formal version you get a strap that might not fit smaller wrist sizes perfectly well for example I have a smaller wrist and use the strap at the very last pin luckily this is a standard 20 ml strap with quick-release pins so you can easily change it for another one the interface here is the familiar Tizen platform which works very well it's not quite as fast as the F of our series 5 but it's close to it and it's definitely miles ahead of the rather stuttery interface on watches like the Fitbit Versa 2 or some garments your watch comes with 15 pre-installed watch faces and on some of them you can add complications just like on the Apple watch and you can customize them a lot and yes you also have an always-on option that slightly dims the watch face but allows you to take a quick glance at the time very discreetly it only works when the watch is on your wrist now here's a quick overview of the different war styles available but notice how switching between watch faces takes a few taps and feels a bit tedious compared to the Apple or series 5 where you just swipe and immediately go to the next watch face you can also get more watch faces via the galaxy wearable app I however found the 15 stock ones do a great job and cover most of my needs and you also have Bigsby here you started by double pressing the HOME key on the bottom and it recognizes queries rather quickly and accurately but unfortunately it's not very useful to say the least Bigsby just has super weird answers for even the simplest of questions ask it about the weather in Baltimore it will give you the forecast for Lutherville timonium maryland a town with a population of 6,000 people I'm not even sure I'm pronouncing the name right and forget about asking it for directions or trivia type questions like the population of a state or a country what you can use it for is to set reminders and alarms and call someone and that's it and yes you can talk right from your wrist and the quality is OK for that you might not be able to hear your contacts good outdoors in a noisy environment it's definitely not as clear as your phone but it does work when it's not too loud and it's a cool feature one thing we didn't like on the Galaxy watch active 2 is the haptics or the vibration feedback when you get a new notification it feels too weak too long nor nearly as precise as the delicate tap you get on the Apple watch so what about activity tracking the watch has an IP 68 so it is Walther protected and you can do laps in the swimming pool with it but you can also do a lot more the thing that impressed me the most about the Samson watch is the automatic workout detection it worked quite well while on the Apple watch it would often fail to record the workout the Samson watch just knew when I was doing workouts and when I would finish with a very good accuracy you have quite the variety in workouts that you can manually start from various gym exercises like bench press dead lifts arm curls - aerobic activities like yoga outdoor hiking and so on and of course it will also track your runs and has GPS - so you can see a map of your run and detailed stats later on we also found the heart rate sensor to give quite accurate readings so you can rely on what you see on the screen most of the time it also has an ECG feature that measures your heart's activity but that one is not enabled yet and will come early next year with a software update one thing that Samsung watched us is also automatically track your sleep if you wear it at night I am not fond of the idea of wearing something on my wrist at night but I tried it and the watch actually felt very comfortable to wear sleep tracking was accurate - and you get a detailed breakdown of different stages of sleep as well as the amount of deep sleep you got and how many times you woke up the sleep tracking only drains about 5% battery over night so this is quite good and what about the actual battery life the fully formal version that we used was able to last almost two days on average of course if you work out a lot and especially use the GPS for your workouts you need to charge the watch more often but two days is the average you get you can squeeze almost a day extra if you use it without the always-on screen mode and you also have power saving battery modes but those limit the functionality a lot you charge the watch via magnetic charger very similar to the Apple watch and the watch snaps nicely to the charger so should you get this over the Apple watch the Galaxy watch has sleep tracking and slightly better battery life plus is cheaper while the Apple watch is Master has more apps and that addictive ring system is also nice stay tuned for an in-depth comparison between the two coming soon at the end of the day we should say that we enjoyed using the Samsung Galaxy watch active to a lot it says very comfortably on the wrist we love the always-on screen option and if you use it with a leather strap it looks downright stylish if you don't want to be tied to the appo eco system yet want a true SmartWatch that is comfortable to wear his reliable performance and a beautiful screen this is about as good as they get in 2019 and this wraps up our review of the watch active tool don't forget to hit that like button subscribe to our Channel phone arena for more videos of the latest in tech my name is Vic and I'll see you next time [Music]
