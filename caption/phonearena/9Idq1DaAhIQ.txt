which phone has the fastest charging speeds here in the table we have the seven most popular smartphones for the year starting with the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the iPhone 11 next comes a brand new grouping so for excel next to the samsung galaxy note n plus right next to it the LG GX thank you followed by the huawei mate 30 Pro n d1 + 17 hello internet video is Paul arena and today is all about which phone will recharge faster and all of these phones here are completely drained we're plugging them in start the timer in the test zone you can see the battery size on each of these phones the huawei leads the way here with this massive 4,500 milliamp hour battery but it's really quite remarkable that these phones now all come with batteries around the four thousand milliamp hour mark you can also see the charges that we have used for each of the phones and the speeds they support 15 minutes into the test we have our first checkpoint the iPhone 11 Pro max has 23 percent on the battery meter the iPhone level has 27 percent the pixel for Excel horizon at 22 percent the galaxy note M plus already has 32 percent the LGG FX is the slowest one so far it just 18 percent the huawei mate 30 Pro has already 38 percent and last but definitely not least a1 + 70 already has 36 percent this means that the phones out of China pull ahead in this test just as you'd expect risky 15 minutes forward and check again the battery levels after 30 minutes 11 Pro max already has 47% the iPhone 11 has slightly more at 53 the pixel for excel has got 45 percent the galaxy note n + also has 45 percent on the battery meter the OGG tax falls further behind the rest at just 34% and finally the home 830 pro + 1 + 70 are battling it out for the first place with 70% on the mate and 69 on the oneplus really impressive fast-forward and next up we check the phone's 45 minutes after the beginning of the test the iPhone 11 Pro max gets 66% on the battery meter the iPhone 11 has 73% the pixel for excel has caught up with the pro max at 66% the galaxy note m+ has 77% and the slow LG g8x thank you only has a 49% charge the last two the Huawei and e1 plus are now tied at 92% this race is getting exciting and we check again at exactly one hour after the start of the test the iPhone 11 Pro max now has 79% the iPhone 11 is a bit ahead at 84% the pixel is now outpacing the prom' access and now has 81% charge a Galaxy Note m+ is now at 93% the LG is firmly in the last spot with just a 63% charge finally the four military prowess on the finish line 99% and look at that the oneplus 70 is already finished and the full 100% charge Congrats oneplus for winning this contest with its warped charge technology keep in mind though that the battery in the oneplus is a bit smaller than the one on the phones so it has a bit of an unfair advantage if you will and just two minutes later the huawei mate 30 pro also rise at the full charge he took it one hour and two minutes to get fully charged now we already have the winners but let's wait it out and see how long it takes the other phones to charge up and one hour and thirty minutes into the test the Galaxy Note m+ also has the hundred percent mark rounding up the top three phones we have our next checkpoint at one hour and 15 minutes the iPhone 11 Pro max is at 88% the iPhone level is at 92 the pixel standard 91% and the OGG 8x is far behind at 76% one hour and a half after the beginning of the test these Falls are still not charged the iPhone pro max has now reached 90 for the iPhone 11 and the pixel for excel now have the same battery level 97% and finally the LG G 8x has 87 percent fast-forward and our next checkpoint is at 1 hour and 45 minutes and at this point in time all of the phones have nearly charged the iPhone alone pro max is at 90 7% the iPhone 11 is at 99 the pixel is also at 99 and the LG is at 95 the pixel for excel finishes first of these just two minutes after that checkpoint and the iPhone 11 takes two more minutes to also charge up fully we need to wait a bit longer and exactly two hours after the beginning of the test the LG is now fully charged the last one left here is the iPhone 11 Pro max it takes two hours and five minutes to go from zero to 100% keep in mind that iPhones have an option in settings called optimized battery charging if you charge your phone overnight it's well advised to have it on it slows down charging speeds towards the end to protect your battery long term if you want the fastest charge though you should turn it off and that is exactly what we've done here it's turned off on both iPhones with this in mind let's recap our charging test u1 plus 70 was the fastest charging phone of the bunch going from zero to 100% in exactly one hour the while we made 30 Pro was second best at 1 hour and 2 minutes in the galaxy note M plus took a bit longer one hour and 13 minutes keep in mind that the Samsung can also charge a peep in faster if you buy the 45 watt fast charger mr. Leo go for purchase separately but if you just use the charger in the box that's the speeds that you get all the other phones took a lot longer hovering around 2 hours for a full charge the pixel for excel was 4th and the iPhone alone charged it about the same time as the pixel for the iPhone 11 we use the 18 watt fast charger that you buy separately and not the slow charger that Apple includes in the box is we just didn't have the patience to wait for 3 hours for a full charge we strongly advise you get that charger it costs around 25 bucks of course you might have heard about the newest phones from China from brands like Oppo and real me that charge fully in just half an hour fortunately those devices are not available in western markets and we did not get to test them we're also not sure about the long-term battery effect of such fast charging whatever the case these here are the charging speeds you get on the most popular phones so far in 2019 let us know your favorites in the comments what you want to see us test next my name is Vic was a pleasure talking to you now see you next time right here on fall arena [Music]
