hey guys it's John be here with phone Reena and this is our unboxing and hands-on video of the Google pixel 3a XL it was announced last week at Google i/o and this is available right now at $479 obviously there's some subtle differences between this and the standard $400 model which is the Google pixel 3a obviously the size their friends the price point but I'll talk more about that now this is a packaging kind of very similar to the pixel line as far as the specs go and this is pretty much the same as the pixel 3a the difference here with the XL is that you get a larger screen it's a six inch AMOLED screen but what's interesting is the resolution for this place actually lower than the standard pixel 3a so the pixel density is not as high but besides that it's powered by the same Snapdragon 670 processor you have 4 gigabytes of RAM there's 64 gigabytes of internal storage the cameras are the same in back there's a single 12 megapixel camera with nitesite the front-facing camera is an 8 megapixel F 2.0 obviously the pixel 3/8 XL is larger in terms of the size so you do get a higher capacity 3 700 million power battery but besides that it should be pretty much identical to the 3a so let's open this up here so first thing there we go here is the phone let's say we got the back here and front there we go and I said this is a polycarbonate construction so you don't have the glass honestly though to me this is still a great-looking phone for the price point the polycarbonate here looks really nice you have almost like a matte finish here in the back there are some elements that are a little bit more glossy good contrast so let me turn this guy on here so I'm gonna let that low it up in the meantime let's see what else we got here so the packaging you have your sim tool ejector your quick user guide some decals and just some more health information it also comes with a USB type-c adapter two standard USB I'll show you this here so you have that if you want to connect a USB device for expandable storage yes you can do that with this because again there is no micro SD card slot with the pixel 3a XL or two 3a here is the USB type-c cable and the last thing in the packaging is of course the charger wall charger one end USB type-c ok there you go it's all set up pretty quickly here it's running in droid 9pi of course it's gonna get Android Q once the update is made available just like the pixels the benefit of this here 3 XL is that you're gonna get the updates a lot faster than most phones because it is the stock Android experience so just a little bit more about the phone there is no water resistant rating with the construction but you do have a headphone jack which I'm a fan of you have your USB type-c port at the bottom here and on the back you have also your fingerprint sensor there is no wireless charging here so you gotta stick with the wide connection but hey honestly for the price point four hundred $79 for the three axl or four hundred bucks for the sander 3a that's some credible value now as far as design goes I've seen phones in this price range to look a little better more premium materials this of course has polycarbonate as the frame here it works for this phone of course the price point and being in that pixel line definitely helps and the great thing too is just the camera we've seen from the presser that the camera is pretty much identical to the regular pixel line with a single camera and it's gonna be able to deliver some incredible results with a high and all the software optimizations so you'll have all the portrait effects and even some great low-light performances so it's gonna be interesting to see how the pixel 3 ACA is going to shake up the industry at the moment so this phone is available right now along with the pixel 3a again the 3a stores had $400 incredible value there while the pixel three Excel starts at four hundred seventy nine bucks stock Android experience same camera as the regular pixel line so that combination alone should make an impressive offering and that is it guys if you want to learn more about the Google pixel 3/8 X pellet you check out our website phone we know comm is John V signing off
