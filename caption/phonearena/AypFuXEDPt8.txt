it is my pleasure to introduce the gallops note [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the node experience has always started with the screen and now for the first time people who've always wanted the power of the note on a smaller device will be able to experience it too we've packed all the power and productivity of the note into two different sizes so you can choose the one that's right for you it's the narrowest note we've ever made and for those diehard note fans the note 10 plus comes with the biggest screen ever on a note both devices are impossibly thin at less than eight millimeters the note tins dynamic AMOLED display is brilliant and utterly immersive and it gives off less blue light to maximize your eye comfort without sacrificing color we designed the note tin to give you more screen with less interruptions in fact the front of the phone has virtually no bezels giving it the highest screen to window ratio ever on a note to make room for all that screen we made the camera cut out smaller and we centered it at the top of the Infinity ou display at the bottom we built an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor right beneath the glass when it comes to color we've designed some amazing new options no matter which note you choose there'll be a perfect color for you including the one of a kind or a glow which creates iridescent colors by refracting light since the very first Galaxy Note users have always recognized that the s-pen is more than just a simple tool and we've made Samsung notes better than ever once you've got your thoughts on the page you can zoom in and out and highlight so it's easy to mark up you know it's exactly the way you want and here's my favorite part now handwritten notes don't have to stay on your phone or tablet you can convert your handwriting into text easier than ever so you can save your notes as text files PDFs or Word documents it can even understand multiple languages of course the s-pen is much more than just a writing tool it's a creativity and productivity tool too this year we're building on that foundation by giving the S Pen a new six axis motion sensor including an accelerometer and a gyroscope in lets you control your device with simple gestures and it can be used to control other apps too with a note 10 you get it end-to-end video experience from the picture quality to the sound to the editing you know our live focus feature the one that allows you to control the bouquet or back background blur to get some really amazing looking photos well with note 10 you can apply bouquet to your videos too now the note 10 lets you zoom in on sounds so as you zoom in both the image and the sounds come into focus super steady puts an action camera in your smartphone we trained the note 10 with over a million frames of footage so it can predict camera movements for different scenes filmmaking isn't just about capturing awesome video and audio that's why we put an entire editing suite right on the note 10 and if you choose a note 10 plus you'll get access to another AR experience that will bring a whole new dimension to your creativity and productivity through our depth vision camera this
