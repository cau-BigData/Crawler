fighting games now there's a hardcore genre that's hard to translate to a smartphone experience still there are the few fighting games for smartphones that somehow managed to scratch the edge let's check them out and we start with final fighter a game that tries to walk the fine line between being a respectable fighting game and somehow working well on mobile phones it achieves that by giving you a virtual joystick and only two buttons to work with the rest is smooth animations and colorful characters it's not as deep as a full-blown console game but it does hit the basics food sees projectiles special moves stamina management and colorful characters that can in no way exist in the real world next up we have another great game punch planet this one is for hours only and not just that it is part of a poor cape but it's great it is actually a game that's being developed for PC and currently in early access on the steam store the game feels really good to play on the iPhone you're given large easy to hit virtual buttons that give off a very reassuring vibration when tapped and the game speed and mechanics are just right in most cases you don't feel like you need more fingers on the screen as the game's combos hit the sweet spot between easy to learn and hard to master next comes food sees food sees is one of the main components that makes a fighting game tick it's basically the skill of being able to stay just outside the breach for your opponent baiting them into making a mistake and capitalizing on it so this here is a super stripped down fighting game that focuses on footsies alone you've got the simple controls for forward back and attack combining them in different ways will get you a couple more special hits but don't expect much in terms of combos or creativity this game is all about practicing your footsies either against an AI which can honestly be infuriating at times or against another player marching forward we have shadow fight three shadow fight has been around for quite a while the second game in the series kept its popularity for years before this iteration arrived of course shadow fight three has more options weapons and moves to a formula that already worked so it's the best one to get right now this new game has super smooth animations and controls and have been fine-tuned to work flawlessly on touch screen it has a super long campaign to plow through as well as online PvP if you prefer that player stomping experience what's bad about it it's a mix between a fighting game and a hero leveling game the latter is done by finding an opening chest to get gear you guessed it you can spend money on gear in this game which essentially makes the PvP of pay2win experience the campaign will also slow down to a halt at some point if you don't cough up the doll but hey it's worth the spin see if you want to support it another great game we have for you is Co girls this game has been around for quite a while it came out for arcades and consoles way back in 2012 it sets itself apart from other fighting games which is distinct art style and insane combo system which allows you to make super long combos yet keeping it fair somehow the smartphone version is a tad toned down you perform your hits and specials by tapping or swiping with one or two fingers across the screen combos are there but kind of limited to your number of tabs the creativity factor which made the originals Kagura special its kind of gone yet for a mobile game it has its charm and somehow manages to scratch that I want to see lots of things go boom itch unfortunately it's a free game that falls in the premium trappings and progression is basically tied to loot boxes next up is price fighters a boxing game which kind of reminds us of the good ol punch-out back for the nests in 1990 but rest assured price fighters is its own thing you can build your boxer by literally picking his fighting style as you progress through the levels there is a solo career but also PvP and even arcade events where you can race with other players to reach the high scorer controls are simple tapped based mechanics but it's all about stamina management proper blocking and picking a fighting style it's you next is a game called fighting X layer alpha here's an interesting take this game is played entirely with taps and swipes and no not in the Marvel contest of Champions kind of way this one tries to have some depth to it with different special moves and the way you can connect them to your simple combo it's definitely an interesting take and sure it doesn't feel comfortable in the beginning but the swipe controls are a thing that can be learned unfortunately the game itself is pretty tiny you only have 4 characters that you fight in this one training location that's it it looks like an unfinished product which the developer meant to build over time but the game hasn't been updated since April of 2019 so check it out but don't put your hopes up next comes Street Fighter 4 champion edition Street Fighter is a true classic and it was actually ported for mobile a while ago champion edition even added controller support and multiplayer now what you get here is a dumbed down version of Street Fighter but you can actually have four different attack buttons and need to input your special moves so it's not a mindless paper that said it does run at a limited framerate for some reason and into this flaky to say the least but hey let Street Fighter it need scratching then we have boxing star a nice looking 3d boxing game the camera sits behind your character in third-person vision and you have controls for dodging in every direction blocking or of course punching the teeth out of your opponent you have a lengthy career mode to climb through and also leave mode where you meet and fight other players last but definitely not least we have a game called chrono blade it plays like a side-scrolling beat'em up when you're in single-player then this portion can just learn and have fun with on of the four selectable characters in PvP mode you put your skills to the test against all other players and this rounds up our selection of the best fighting games for iOS and Android that you can play right now in 2020 which of these games looks the most fun to you and did we miss a great fighting game that should be
