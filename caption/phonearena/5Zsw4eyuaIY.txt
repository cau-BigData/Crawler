after last year's slow sales of the galaxy s 9 Samsung was eager to come back strong and a month after the launch it's time to take a look at how well it has done this with the new Galaxy S 10 and the S 10 plus hello friends Vic with felony here and the galaxy s 10 and yes 9 look and feel different from the start the newer model is lighter and more pleasing to halt the harsh edges that make the S line a bit unpleasant to handle are gone instead to get a slim and light device that packs a lot of hardware in a slimmer package the bezels have gone slimmer making the phone few more compact and the difference is especially noticeable when you compare the non plus models the rest of the differences boil down to the fingerprint and cameras the capacitive fingerprint scanners at the back of the S line have been substituted for an in display ultrasonic solution on the s 10 series which is definitely cool looking but it's far from perfect in terms of accuracy and we find the older traditional fingerprint reader on the S line more reliable in terms of performance power you get the snapdragon 855 on the s10 for the s9 features the older Snapdragon 805 chip now this boost in performance but the truth is that both the s10 and the S line feel fast and it's hard to notice any significant differences in regular real-life usage like social media browsing gamers and other power users however will appreciate the newer silicon on the s10 we continue counting the differences by looking at the back we now have a third camera on the s10 a neutral white one this fun to use but in terms of the main two cameras the image quality you can expect on the s10 it's largely identical to that of last year's galaxy s 9 Series as far as details and colors are concerned the two phone generations are comparable and the very subtle differences here and there can be safely ignored image quality hasn't skyrocketed but a gr is improved and the colorscience is a bit more spot-on on the Galaxy S ten plus one difference worth mentioning is in the live focus mode the s9 uses the telephoto lens to shoot portraits while the s10 instead uses the main camera this is where newer is not necessarily better as people's faces look better proportioned on a telephoto camera both the s9 and the s10 shoot excellent 4k video and up to 60 frames per second details are plentiful exposure colors and stabilization are all great on both series on the s10 doll the third camera the ultra wide one opens a new range of possibilities for creative video shooting the s10 series has one exclusive feature that we need to mention the new super steady stabilization mode it's excellent and helps create extremely smooth videos it also uses the ultra wide-angle camera just in case you wondered currently both the galaxy s 10 and galaxy s 9 series are running Android 9pi with the new one UI skin on top for the most part the interface is very similar on the tool with a few subtle differences Samsung certainly deserves credit for the new one UI interface is it really shines on the larger galaxies who particularly appreciate little touches like bringing some controls to the bottom of the screen for easier reach so the final question should galaxy s 9 users upgrade to the galaxy s 10 oh yes and no well the galaxy s 10 and the SN Plus both feel like excellent follow-ups to the galaxy s 9 series once you draw the line you will find out that the differences and improvements are actually not that many and they're mostly marginal the s 10 looks more modern with its thinner bezels more powerful chip more onboard storage and the few camera improvements but it's also significantly more expensive so s9 owners were not in a hurry might just wait it out until the new S 11 comes to town unless you have money to burn of course then you can get the newer one and if you have some love to give you can do this by clicking on the thumbs up button to this video by subscribing to our channel and by dropping a comment with your thoughts about these phones you should also know that my colleague Peter worked on this comparison he has a lot more photos tests and thoughts about these phones and you can see them at our webpage at www.weather.gov/phoenix for being with us and I'll talk to you in the next one [Music]
