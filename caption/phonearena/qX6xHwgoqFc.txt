the Motorola Xoom will certainly turn some heads this four hundred and fifty dollar mid Ranger comes with a design that is distinctly Motorola and flaunts it proudly with a glowing Moto logo on the back hello Internet Vic with following here and this foam offers great value for the money if you solid and is mostly comfortable to hold if you somehow managed to learn to avoid a huge camera module with your index finger and yes we'll talk about these cameras but let's get the rest of the phone's features out of the way real fast now the six point four inch OLED display up front is pretty good-looking according to our benchmarks the color reproduction is not really on point and if you use the device in the default saturated mode it's a bit aggressive on the eyes but if you switch to the tame or boosted mode the screen becomes more balanced easy on the eye and pleasant to look at it can also get very bright so although visibility is great in typical Motorola fashion we have a pretty clean Android experience with Android 9pi onboard there are a few moto extras sprinkled throughout like the signature gesture controls the phone has a Snapdragon 675 processor inside which is not top-shelf hardware but it runs pretty solid here we were able to play games browse the web and just generally use the one zoom without many issues it can also go on for a considerable amount of time a four thousand milliamp hour battery gave us two days of moderate to use easily and Motorola didn't skimp on the storage as well we got 128 gigs of internal storage which can be further expanded via a microSD card slot alright let's talk about these cameras as you can see we have an impressive array of four lenses on the back here don't get overwhelmed this one is only here for that collection and it's not really usable the other three are your regular wide-angle lens with a 48 megapixel sensor underneath an 8 megapixel telephoto camera and a 16 megapixel ultra wide-angle camera the main camera is pretty good images come out balanced and ready for social media shoulder bugs will be annoyed by the aggressive over sharpening the there was really no need to go that far with it portrait shots are also pleasant surprise it seems like the depth detecting sensor is doing its job and challenging shots like the dog in the picture here don't seem to face it edge of detection is on point and the fur doesn't mix with the trees in the background what's really annoying though is that the portrait mode does not use the three times telephoto lens but instead relies on the 48 megapixel main camera so it's wide portraits only with this phone now how much can you zoom of the Motorola one zoom camera fans will be happy to know that the telephoto lens here gives you three times of pure optical enhancement if you go beyond that the phone will use a hybrid image between the 48 megapixel main sensor and the 8 megapixel telephoto camera to give you a total of 10 times zoom which honestly there's not pretty sharp for what it is you can use this hybrid zoom option either when taking a photo or when recording a 1080p video due to wide-angle camera is honestly nothing to write home about we'd say it's there just for those times that you may need one but it's details are soft and there is a very noticeable amount of green cast when using it videos don't turn out great either last but not least the selfie camera on the front is nothing too smart yet it has a 28 megapixel sensor and its imagery is pretty good the colors are balanced the dynamic range is generous enough and the details come out much more realistic than what mr. sharp here on the back gives us in general the Motorola wanna zoom is a pretty good phone in fact it offers a great value at four hundred and fifty dollars but this price range is the stopping grounds of Google's pixel 3a in pixel 3a XL which may be made out of plastic but offers superb camera performance or if you add $50 more to your budget we can get a 1 plus 16 or Asus zenfone 6 which may not be better in the camera department but come with top-tier Hardware inside and that's our review of the Motorola 1 zoom don't forget to also check out our website over at wwe.com for the latest news and detailed phone tests thanks for watching this my name is Vic and I will see you in the next one [Music]
