okay guys we have two of the absolutely best smartphones on the market the galaxy s 20 ultra is Samsung's offering and the iPhone 11 Pro max is the best that Apple has to offer and honestly this one is $1,100 this one is $1,400 both are absolute beasts and you can't go wrong with either one so that's it video over bye okay fine okay okay we'll compare them we'll compare them it's okay huh so where do we start we have two devices with huge brilliant screens by the way both displays are made by Samsung it's just that the one on the iPhone is tuned to Apple specs and on the galaxy Samsung does its own stuff with its colors rest assured that both are natural and just beautiful to look at of course Samsung likes to thin out the bezel every year and we've got this very very futuristic look with just a tiny cutout for the front camera and on the iPhone we've got the more classic look with the notch and bigger bezels which is honestly not that bad always because on this one you will sometimes get ghost touches with your palm or they at the end of the earth um well this one is kind of easier to hold but these are a small complaints one huge gripe that I have with these Samsung is that it's a $1,400 phone that either comes in brilliant black or vibrant gray I mean for $1400 some people might like to get something that's a bit more shiny a bit more show off it I mean it's a tech accessory it's a premium tech accessory on the Apple side yeah it's not super shiny but at least you get gold you get white you get the new green which is kind of mysterious and of course if you want something more subtle you do have a choice of stealth black and it may also come down to harder of course but again these are absolute beasts we've got the Apple a something here in the Qualcomm Snapdragon 12 gigawatts of RAM I don't know editor just put a graph with the specs here please anyway how do they run well very smoothly very fast iOS of is fine-tuned by Apple to run on Apple hardware and it will freeze all of the apps in the background it will save resources and it's always smooth never choppy the same can be said here of course Samsung packed a lot of stuff into this phone we have 12 gigabytes of RAM we have the e Snapdragon 88 6 5 we've got a 5 thousand milliamp hour battery and again it will also run very fast and very smooth and on the samsung galaxy s 20 altra we have a 120 Hertz display this means that it refreshes the image more often twice as much as the iphone doors and the animations look smoother it's nothing we can show you on camera but you know it's kind of addictive still it's not really the big selling point do you know what the big selling point of both of these phones is the great cameras so Samsung knocked it out of the park with a 100 times zoom it goes up to 4 times optically this means that the lens itself is a four time zoom then we have ten times hybrid zoom where Samsung does some weird black magic with both the cameras and the digital cropping of the images that it takes and then we have up to 100 times pure digital zoom now in all honesty the quality of the 100 times zoom it's not the best but truth is that is there so that's basically a lot of headroom yeah you don't need to zoom that much every single day but it's nice to have it like when you go on a trip to the zoo and want to zoom in on some animal that's hiding far away in the cage or you go to your kids soccer game and you want to take a certain snap of that the iPhone doesn't offer any crazy zooming features but it does have the now default super wide angle wide-angle and telephoto camera and it does provide pretty good shots in fact if you put them side-by-side in a camera comparison phones go blow for blow sometimes the iPhone is a bit underexposed sometimes the galaxy does something weird with the over sharpening or the overexposure but in general the overarching picture is that they're absolutely fantastic camera phones you just have the zoom on tap on this one and of course there's also the argument that es the iPhone 11 Pro max does start at $1,100 but it's based storage variant is only 64 gigabytes well this one yeah it's $1,400 but it comes with 256 gigabytes of storage still though if you go and get an iPhone pro max with 256 gigabytes it's still 1250 that's still 150 dollars less than in the galaxy s 20 ultra but enough of that it's 20/20 and we need to look at the bigger picture well I mean I mean that every manufacturer right now has their own ecosystem so I like a kind of game the same goes for Samsung like if you have a more diverse ecosystem at home like a Windows PC a Samsung Smart TV or any of their home appliances you will find it easier to connect this phone to your stuff at home so this is also something to consider if you're building your own ecosystem right now yeah sure go ahead and pick either this phone to be the centerpiece or this one but if you already have some sort of a tech lifestyle consider this Apple tech loves Apple stuff Android tech likes to work with third-party a lot more and of course there is also the investment side of things Apple likes to support it phones up to five years after release this means the iPhone 11 pro max will get up to probably iOS 17 or iOS 18 while Samsung does promise two years of Android updates post release but we have no what's gonna happen next with all of that said I'm back to my original point zoom on tap crazy zoom reliability third-party software apps services games incredible ecosystem basically the choice is yours
