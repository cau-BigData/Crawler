hello everyone and welcome to another phone arena-style battery drain test this time with the brand new iPhone se 2020 Edition Apple's new se might well stand for small edition these days and it also comes with a very tiny battery as well just eighteen hundred and twenty-one milliamp hours can Apple pull out a battery life miracle out of such a small battery well that's exactly what we're about to find out and you can see you lined up and ready to go five phones for this test the iPhone se is first from the left next we have the iPhone 11 next comes the iPhone 10 are and then we have two very popular and now also very affordable galaxy s 10 series phones the regular s 10 and then the super compact galaxy s 10 e all of them have a much larger battery size than the iPhone se so it will be a David against Goliath situation but we have not one but for Goliath the phones against the SE let's waste no time then and get started with one thing that most of us do for hours on our phones watch videos in this test we use YouTube to stream videos without interruption and measure which phone will die first the test that you see on your screen is a placeholder run and not the actual test run and the reason being that a it takes very long hours and B we usually run it a couple of times to get a more reliable average score and that's what you're seeing with this important disclaimer in mind let's get going and you can already see what the test looks like with videos playing back right now in fast motion and if you have been following our battery tests in the past you probably already know that iPhones in general are not great for YouTube video streaming and the iPhone se proves that this hasn't changed one bit is it is the first phone to die on this test with a score of just four hours in 45 minutes that is the lowest score we have seen on this test in the last couple of years and what happens when you play videos on the SE is that the battery just dropped by a percentage point about every three minutes or less all the other phones are still going and takes one more hour until the next phone on this list bites the dust and that one is the iPhone 10 R with a score of five hours in 15 minutes much better than the SE but still far from great the three phones left still have some juice left in the tank so we have to wait more than one additional hour until the next phone battery dies and that phone is the iPhone 11 with a score of 7 hours and 13 minutes despite the two galaxies being much older phones they still last a long time the galaxy s 10 outlasts the iPhone 11 by some five minutes on this test [Music] finally the winner in our YouTube's test is the small but very resilient Galaxy S 10 he his battery lasts seven hours and 50 minutes a great showing for samsung him for such a compact device and you can quickly take a look at the scores once again in this chart feel free to pause it and take a better look because it's time to move on to the next test what you see on your screens right now is our browsing test we use the Chrome browser on Android phones and Safari on iPhones and all the phones are running the same script there's cycles through webpages and Scrolls up and down and it's a great way to see how the phones perform without much stress and all of them last much longer on this test now we run it a couple of times to ensure correct results and show you the average score so once again you're not seeing the actual test run but a placeholder and that's why the top parts of the phones are blurred in fact the first one to have its battery drained is the galaxy s 10 here which scores 8 hours and 9 minutes which is not all that great all other phones still keep on going but an hour after the s 10 we're seeing that the brand new iPhone se also bites the dust with a final score of 9 hours and 5 minutes so there's the second test where the iPhone se battery life is not great and that's not exactly surprising but it's interesting nonetheless [Music] next up the Galaxy S Tandy is the next phone to have his battery drained at the 9:00 hour in 26 minute mark what's interesting is that the two 6.1 inch iPhones still keep on going and while they disappointed us with the Youtube test they are way ahead of the others on the browsing test the iPhone 10 R finishes the test will score of 11 hours in 8 minutes a gray showing and the iPhone 11 gets the wind with an even bigger score of 11 hours and 25 minutes this test really illustrates how for every daylight use these iPhones are really outstanding performers and even the iPhone se is not all that bad on this test [Music] finally we have our 3d gaming test this one is great because it shows something different it uses the GPU a lot while on the other test you have mostly the CPU firing if you play games on your phone this test is very important to you unfortunately the brand-new iPhone se is once again the first one to die on this test not even reaching five hours of gaming keep in mind that we're running the test at low settings and in real life with more intense gaming like pop G or Call of Duty its battery will be dead much faster the tiny se is an absolute disappointment for gamers it's great having the fastest chip on the market but of what use is it if it drains the battery so quickly the next phone to die on this test is the Galaxy S 10 which lasted 5 hours and 35 minutes not a great showing either but not quite as bad as the iPhone se and the other two finished with much better scores the Galaxy S 10 e lasts 6 hours and 35 minutes of playtime and then the iPhone 11 remains the winner who get the chicken dinner with a score of seven hours in 37 minutes we had a technical difficulty with the iPhone 10 our for the 3d gaming test and we had to skip it for this test and now is a good time to once again recap all of the scores and how the phones did in each one of them the big winner here is unsurprisingly the iPhone 11 it's the most expensive phone of the bunch and it's battery lasts a long time for pretty much everything except for watching videos now if you do a lot of that you will be better off with a Samsung phone as the galaxy is both performed excellently in this regard now we were surprised with how long the battery on the tiny galaxy he lasted and if you really want a small phone with great battery life you should know that you get much better battery life on the s10 II then on the iPhone S II and that brand new S II is we're talking about it as powerful as it is as great a camera as it has its battery life is a big disappointment and we cannot recommend it for people who want their phone to last a long time still if you only use your phone lightly don't play games and don't watch many videos you'll be absolutely fine with the S II it will last you about a day but it's the heavy users that we have a hard time with it and that wraps up our battery drain test with the brand new iPhone se and its rivals are you surprised with the results honestly I was expecting more from Apple even a slightly bigger battery would have made the iPhone se almost irresistible but Apple just reused the old chassis with the old battery of the iPhone 8 and just called it a day whatever it is let me know which of these phones would you go for do you have a favorite I'm looking forward to your comments let me know what you want to see from us next likes are hugely appreciated as battery tests really take a very long while and subscribe if you feel extra awesome my name is Vic this is phone arena stay
