just five months after Samsung unveil this sporty galaxy watch active the successor is now here the brand new Galaxy watch active 2 is official and it now comes in two different sizes and has a few new features hello guys my name is Vic with phone marina and I spent some time with Samsung's newest smartwatches at the ephah tech show in Berlin and these are our first impressions first the watch active 2 looks just a lot better the original watch was tiny and it felt a bit too plastic in toy like while this new one feels premium it is available in two versions one with an aluminum frame that by default comes with a sporty band and a more premium version made of stainless steel which by default comes with a stylish leather strap the two sizes are also very welcome you can choose between a 40 millimeter watch and a much larger 44 millimeter one a cool new feature allows you to match the colors of your watch face to your daily outfit simply take a picture of yourself and the watch will extract the key colors and apply them to the current watch face nice nice move Samsung watches recently featured a very useful rotating bezel that you could use to navigate around the watch while the watch active 2 does not have a physical rotating bezel it resurrects this idea with a virtual one simply slide your finger along the edges of the watch and you can move around menus just like you would on a physical rotating bezel take some getting used to but it works surprisingly well probably the most important new feature of the galaxy watch active 2 is its ECG sensor which allows the watch to measure your heart's activity the feature will not be available at launch but it's coming via an update and early 2020 and the rest is all about activity tracking and notifications we have a total of 39 activities that you can track and 7 of those are tracked automatically running walking cycling swimming rowing machine elliptical machine and dynamic workouts the running coach feature is also here with 7 different running programs Samsung also says that the sensor said the rear the wearable are improved and should take readings much faster the watch active 2 now also features a cell or model so it can be used even when you don't have your phone on you so are you sold on this new watch the active 2 is coming to stores on September 27th and prices will start at 280 dollars for the smaller aluminum model and $300 for the larger one and those are our first impressions with the watch active 2 don't forget to hit that like button if you enjoyed watching this subscribe to see more my name is Vic and I'll see you next time right here and for marina [Music]
