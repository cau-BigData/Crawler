good morning and welcome to the Steve Jobs feed the next generation of iPhone and it is jam-packed with great new capabilities in an incredible new design it has a 6.1 inch liquid Retina display with true tone white color tapped awake and haptic touch and even more places with Iowa's 13 like contextual menus and now we have spatial audio which provides an immersive theater like experience by creating a sound field around you using an apple design virtualizer and we support Dolby Atmos for an incredible sound experience we have an amazing dual camera system with an all-new wide camera with a new sensor with a hundred percent focused pixels for faster autofocus three times faster and low-light and we have a new ultra wide camera with a hundred and twenty degree field of view this will let you capture way more in your photos and videos so now when you're taking a wide camera shot you'll see our new immersive camera interface that lets you see outside the frame hinting at a bigger shot then you can simply tap to switch to the ultra wide revealing more of your scene and either 11 has this wide-angle camera so you can take these beautiful wide shots of portraits for people but now with two cameras we have stereoscopic depth so now you can also take portraits of your favorite pets let's talk about night mode this is for those very low-light environments like outdoors at night or inside a dimly lit restaurant and night mode comes on automatically when it's dark enough to brighten photos and reduce noise here's an image with night mode turned off here it is with night mode turn on we determined the image fusion time and use adaptive bracketing based on what we see in preview so shorter frames if you have subject motion or longer frames if you have deep shadows to recover them then we intelligently fuse images together reduce motion and blur so in taking video you can easily tap to switch to the ultra wide camera to capture even more on your scene you can also use the zoom wheel to just transition easily between the two cameras because we support 4k resolution up to 60 frames per second slow-mo time-lapse cinematic video stabilization and now extend a dynamic range at 4k up to 60 frames per second and this is across both cameras which is pretty cool we also wanted to make it easier for you to take a quick video with quick take so now when you're taking photos and you decide you want to take a quick video simply tap and hold the shutter button to record a video in fact it has the highest quality video ever in a smart phone we've also updated our front a true depth camera to a wider 12 megapixel sensor so now you can still take your 7 megapixel selfies as you normally would but simply rotate the landscape to capture even more people using that wider sensor also on the front camera we've added 4k video with extended dynamic range up to 30 frames per second and you can also capture on the front at 4k 60 as well now we've also added slow-motion video to the front camera for the first time well now we're introducing the a13 bionic the next generation of our industry-leading chip the a 13 is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone so with the advancements in iphone 11 it'll still have an hour more and vim battery than your iPhone 10 are the advances an iPhone 11 really touch areas that customers experience every day this is

and shadow details we actually paired the three cameras right at the factory calibrating them for color and exposure and then all the time while you're using them we actually do some smart things like we in real time take data from the camera you're shooting with and prime the other cameras automatically for auto focus auto exposure color temperature even tone mapping so you can get a smooth
