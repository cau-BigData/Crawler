[Music] this is the new one +7 pro it has a fun pop up selfie camera an impressive screen with tiny bezels and no notch and it sticks with what made oneplus successful an Android experience with no bloatware and so well optimized it runs faster than pretty much any other Android phone out there I've been using the oneplus 7 pro in the past couple of weeks and I can confidently say that this phone will blow your mind but also there's one thing to consider you one +7 Pro has turned out to be not just big it's pretty gigantic it's pretty much the size of a galaxy note 9 or an iPhone 10's max and because it's also quite thick it feels even bigger than that perfect for those who love a big phone but if you prefer a mid-sized phone oh the oneplus mm pro would probably be too big for you and that's it it's pretty much the only major downside of the oneplus 7 pro for oils this phone is just kind of perfect it all starts with the screen you have a massive six point seven inch AMOLED display and we have seen many many screens here at Fallen arena but this one is special it has rich vibrant colors it looks good at an angle it is just incredibly impressive easily one of the very best screens you have ever seen on a smartphone but what will truly blow your mind are these two words ninety Hertz apart from specialized gaming phones no mainstream flagship has this feature what means is that the screen will refresh 90 times per second much faster than the traditional 60 Hertz refresh rate you don't need to be an expert to see the difference it's immediately obvious everything flows incredibly smoothly everything runs incredibly quickly this will spoil you in fact it's so easy to get used to this new rate that when switching to another phone an older phone you feel like it's lagging and stuttering there is one more slight annoyance the screen is curved at the edges and it's a bigger curvature than on the s10 series so I was getting a lot of accidental touches because those bezels are just so tiny under the hood the phone is powered by the snapshot eight five five chip and the base 700 mob dollar model comes with six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of non-expandable storage for just $50 more you get eight gigs of RAM and double the storage at 256 gigabytes and that is the version that we recommend you also have a whopping 12 gigabytes of RAM version with 256 gigs of storage for eight hundred and twenty dollars have the price of a similarly powerful galaxy s 10 plus and still a great deal but it's not only about the specs we have seen other phones with the same chip and the same 12 gigabytes of RAM that just lack the fluidity the 7 Pro is not just fast it's also smooth and fluid thanks to the work of a team of engineers dedicated to removing every millisecond of lag because some oxygen OS onboard here is based on android 9 pi it's one of our favorite Android interfaces this is a clean skin with a few useful additions you now have a screen recorder and nifty feature missing on Google's own pixel phones for example you also have a dedicated gaming mode that optimizes performance and ensures non important notifications will not interrupt and then you have a dark theme with black backgrounds unfortunately you cannot have the phone automatically switch to the dark team at night you have to enable it manually you also have the very useful so-called shelf a screen on the left of your home screen where you can stack all of your widgets neatly what is strangely missing however is digital well being the Google feature that tracks your phone usage is not here so the camera it has been the one weak point of oneplus phones so far this time around you have three cameras on the back and one on the front the most ever on a oneplus phone now the three cameras on the back are the main one an ultra wide-angle one and a telephoto one with three times zoom the quality from the main camera is better than before but still not quite there with the best the two issues here are slightly bleak bill colors and detail that is a bit on the soft side the two other rear cameras also give you a lot of versatility to capture different shots but the killer feature for me was the new portrait mode oneplus uses the telephoto camera and with three times zoom you get a look that is very similar to what you get on a professional DSLR with a professional portrait lens the soft detail here actually looks flattering to people's faces and smoothens imperfections like wrinkles that other Falls often exaggerate the portraits that we got with this camera in just a couple of weeks are truly something special now battery life has traditionally been great on oneplus phones and here it is great too our tests show that this one is just a bit worse than earlier oneplus models but we had absolutely no trouble getting through a full day even with a lot of use advanced it quite a few other phones failed call quality is great too we have support for voice over LTE and colors can hear crystal-clear and the same is true with the loud earpiece on your end with an amazing display a good enough camera solid battery life one of the fastest smoothest user interfaces and sold at a price much lower than the competition the oneplus 7 pro has raised the bar higher than ever before on a 2019 flagship phone this is a dream phone that we can easily recommend to everyone and if you enjoyed watching this video why don't you hit that thumbs up button and subscribe to our channel to see even more my name is Vic
