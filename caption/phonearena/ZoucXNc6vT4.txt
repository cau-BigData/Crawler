motorola might be entering the flagship game these days but it has made a name for itself with budget moto G series we have not one not two but three new Moto G phones for review and just like the g7 series last year these models start from the dirt cheap to just cheap starting with the Moto G 8 power light a super affordable phone with a low resolution LCD screen and a basic mediatek processor then you have the Moto G 8 a slightly more expensive phone that still gives you a lower resolution screen but comes with a faster processor and finally you have the Moto G 8 power the most exciting in the family with a decent 1080p display and the massive battery my name is Vic and for this review I had to grow an extra arm to use all three phones at the same time but don't worry it did not take me long to find out that one of these phones really you shouldn't even consider that phone is the Moto G power light sure it has the lowest price at about 170 dollars but the mediatek processor inside is a huge compromise as lag and stutter is common in the experience and display quality is bad bezels are extra large making an already big phone even larger and the camera is slow and produces photos that are usable but definitely don't look great so please don't buy that phone you'll be much better off spending just a bit more and getting a vastly better phone in fact here's our advice despite that it is the heaviest of the three we can wholeheartedly recommend you spend the extra fifty bucks or so to pick the Moto G eight power over the light or the g8 as it delivers decent pictures and video reasonably fast performance good pixel density on the screen and above all it will likely last you two or even three days with normal usage for that 250 dollar price so beat that the regular g8 performs decently but it has a low resolution screen and you don't get the amazing battery of the g8 power so while the g8 runs fine we'll still not recommend it over the g8 power now with this in mind let's talk about the details i'll despite the LCD panel technology motorola still managed to punch a trendy hole through the screens to fit the front camera on the g8 and the g8 power while the light model makes do with the good old water drop not for the purpose now the phones are surprisingly heavy considering their plastic build but two of them have giant 5,000 milliamp hour batteries and all of them feel solid in the hand without creaking or flexing bags they're also rather big for the screen diagonals now that especially applies for the lite version which has some gigantic bezels all around and then there are nice little design touches all around the phones like the presence of notification light or headphone jack all things we have begun feeling nostalgic about in recent phones and when it comes to screen colors though all three get just a passing grade despite the low prices the phones carry pretty diverse camera sets with additional telephoto and wide-angle cameras as well as a macro camera on the g8 power as one can expect the quality of the photos is nothing to write home about even on the quad cam power in broad daylight they aren't passable grades but as soon as the light starts to dim down the focusing starts to suffer surprisingly the light model with the most basic camera set of the three was able to produce sharper photos with more natural color presentation indoors however the roles reversed as its narrow aperture here and the power light makes its performance even worse now the Moto G 8 and the g8 power produce pretty identical photos with a bit oversaturated and warmer than reality colors compared to what comes out of the light now the wide-angle and telephoto shots are in the past grade as well and we appreciate having those cameras now continuing with the differences only the light model cannot record 4k video so it only has 1080p while the g8 and the g8 power are all capable of 4k footage with 30 frames per second the problem however is the day struggle to focus in 4k mode while the g8 power light did well with focusing in or 1080p footage and well you shouldn't expect greatness at these prices for any of these phones but for decent video we'll do recommend using 1080p recordings on all of the phones now with a pretty solid for the category of the core snapdragon 616 on the 11 nanometer process and paired with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of internal storage space the Moto G 8 and the Moto G 8 power do fine and benchmarks and we have already mentioned that the light with a slowly mediatek helio p35 chip legs and stutters quite badly now the phone's all come with Android 10 out of the box the interface is clean Android with a few nifty bells and whistles it you have seen in previous Motorola phones you have the Moto e actions like twisting the phone to start the camera you have the Moto display the attentive display that gives a screen on as long as you're looking at it and so on we find all of these quite useful and nice now for biometrics all phones use a traditional fingerprint scanner at the back of the phone and it is very fast and we appreciate it in these mask-wearing times in our battery benchmark test the g8 power light despite having a big 5 thousand milliamp hour battery did not perform as good probably due to the worst power management of the chip but still would easy to last you more than a day not as great as the others but still quite good the cheat was 4,000 milliamp hour battery also performs decently but the really impressive phone here is the g8 power that who easily last you two days of the charger and even more with moderate use this phone breaks all records and battery longevity so it's definitely recommended if you're looking for a phone with great battery life and this wraps up this review of the new Moto G 8 series once again the Moto G power is the one we recommend the other two the Moto G 8 and the Jade pallet are slightly cheaper but come with big compromises so don't forget to tell me your experience with these phones in the comments thanks for watching this video like if you enjoyed watching it subscribe if you want to see more from
