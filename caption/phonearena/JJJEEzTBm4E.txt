hey guys it's press and I came with the orient-express what you're looking at is a camera comparison with the iPhone 11 Pro and d1 + 8 pro this is the selfie video right now so I'm just gonna walk around like an influencer into the light spin around back into the shadow so we can see how the two cameras perform of course we'll also switch the sound from one camera cameras to the other so you can check how each microphone performs but basically this is the quality of selfie you get with these two phones back into the light and then back into the shadow when we go all right here is a quick video sample with the 1 + 8 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro following the dog around come on look in this dynamic scene we've got shadows we've got highlights from the Sun some greenery [Music] [Music] here's a quick all the focus comparison there's a critical test the iPhone can go up to six by and do you want this then go up to after 6:00 the icon so this is 6x room with bar forms Dominion and both phones can go into a wide-angle mode as you're shooting video good for landscape shots or action camera shots if you wish as does the stabilization contact don't attack the phones moving on to pictures in the daylight you'll notice that you want was it pro can definitely hold its own it's details or sometimes softer and it sometimes likes to amp up colors a bit too much but in this photo for example the red egg and the chickens around it for more vibrant and the shot is more appealing to the eye other times all it will amp up caused a bit too much and make them unrealistic like over here on the graffiti wall the drawing on the left this is not the right teal color which do you want was it provided the iPhone 11 picture is much more honest and accurate in this scene I like a bit of both phones actually the details of the bricks in the shadow on the 1 + 8 Pro photo better to my eye and then on the iPhone 11 Pro photo I like the details under the sunlight better swapping to the ultra wide-angle lenses on both phones at the same scene we can see that the 1 plus 8 pro ultra wide camera is a bit colder in the main one while the iPhone 11 Pro kept the very same color of calibration in both scenarios moving on with some landscape shots we can see slight differences again the 1+8 draw likes to amp up colors just a bit more maybe add a bit more contrast but both phones have amazing idea in this shot in particular take note of the clouds in the top left the iPhone 11pro did better at capturing them yo 1 + 8 Pro kind of smudge them but then this is a 10 times zoom on the same scene and you only 1 + 8 Pro you can see sharper details and better performance in the zoom camera this is a three times zoom shot so the 1 + 8 Pro has optical zoom here the iPhone and 11 Pro did a bit of digital zooming but still the f-111 shot looks better with sharper hairs on the toggle and better colors as for portraits both phones are fantastic performers you can see that subject separation is great the douglas-fir is not mixing with the branches or the flowers in the background on both photos are the 1 + 8 Pro like to go a bit more saturated a bit more contrasty but both portraits are pretty pretty great here and again a portrait mode shot the iPhone 11 Pro did a better job at capturing details in my face here with the white hairs in my beard clearly visible while the 8 megapixel sensor of the 1 + 8 pro's portrait camera kind of softened the details on my face hey guys this is a quick video sample with the 1 + 8 Pro in the iPhone 11 Pro at night Kondo mr. selfie at night no flashes no nothing as you can see it's complete darkness so both forms are very challenged the iPhone 11 pro introduced a lot of noise while the oneplus 8 pro tried to clean up that noise and completely flattened out my face but hey what can you do some simple pictures during the night this is with night mode off on both phones the oneplus 8 pro provides some more details some better covers now we turn night clothes on and we get sharp details and great colors from both phones again night mode off you can see the iPhone 11 Pro kind of struggles at pulling details from the shadows here while the cantos 8 pro is a bit more exposed but when we turn night bolts on again we have a 50/50 here great performance with both phones with accurate colors and sharp details again night mode off iphone is a bit darker 1 + 8 Pro is a bit more vibrant a bit more exposed now turning on night mode on and again slight differences here the iPhone 11 Pro definitely gave us a sharper shot with a better color reproduction you can see that the 1 + 8 Pro does have a brighter image but since it keeps a slower shutter speed to achieve that the dog's face got blurred because the doggy was moving I did press the shutter button at the same time on both phones here this is a portrait shot at night very challenging shot it looks very mysterious great performance from both phones I should note that the oneplus 8 pro kind of struggled at picking up the subject while I was trying to take his portrait and this is an ultra wide camera shot no night mode was used here you can see the oneplus 8 Pro again delivered a brighter image and that about does it the what was 8 Pro can actually play with the big boys amazing camera performance from both phones some flaws here and there but hey not bad not
