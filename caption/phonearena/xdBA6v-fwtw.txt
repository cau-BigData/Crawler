Apple is a very divisive company it has millions of fans but also millions of haters under every article video or social media posts that's related to Apple there are always comments from both groups and the same battles are often fought between friends in real life as well you probably already well know what makes Apple loved from the beautiful time-tested design of their products to some bold decisions it has taken throughout the years but now it's time to flip the coin and see what people have against it hello guys liquidfun arena here and first things first you might be surprised to learn that there is real scientific research about people hating Apple in a recent paper called consumer brand hate steamrolling whatever I see published in psychology and marketing and linked in the description below a survey of around 500 people found that about 50% of brand hate comes from the 30 brands listed in the most valuable global brand list the research calls this phenomenon negative double jeopardy or simply put the most valuable brands generate more brand hate than less valuable counterparts in this study Apple ranked even ahead of Walmart the company employing many people working at the lowest pay rates so why is that a target of so much hate reason number one because Apple products are so expensive and sometimes it is hard to explain why for years we have been hearing the same argument from people well this other phone has doubled the RAM and it costs half the price of an iPhone and the reason this is hard to explain is well this is kind of true other phones do typically come with more RAM and even more storage than an iPhone yes still many people prefer an iPhone over those other phones because Ram doesn't matter that much to them other things like the familiarity and the stability of the platform do whatever the reasons Apple Racing the largest profit margins in the industry and his products are consistently the most expensive ones in their category company managers surely approve but for many consumers this seems too greedy and in creates many people reason number two if you are a tech person you know what these two words mean walled garden this is a real phenomenon hello just isn't willing to abide by the same open rules like the rest of the industry Bluetooth file-sharing was a standard across all phones until Apple and the iPhone came along it was a reason why I Poe revolted against it it was a slow and not particularly effective way of sending files but it was Universal and you can hear tech people hating Apple because of that even today the general idea however is that Apple is building an ecosystem with many ways in and few ways out the company would actively promote exclusive apps and games you cannot find on other platforms iMessage locks you in your iPhone and you simply have no Android alternative even less popular apps like Apple maps are not available in Android the Apple watch will not work with any other phone but an iPhone the humble speaker is also not of much use unless you use an iPhone and then you have all the unique tricks shared between iOS and Mac OS easier sharing and so on and on the other hand the painful iTunes happen windows so there you have the metaphor Apple is building a beautiful garden of products that interact seamlessly together yet are incompatible with the rival Android platform for many people this is unfair and not a practice they support so they end up hating Apple and his tactics reason number 3 Apple is the epitome of consumerism depending on the price of a stock Apple is often the most valuable brand in the world which basically means its winning at capitalism and it's doing that not only by selling millions of products but by also feeling people the philosophy that its products make us better humans you've probably heard things like give people wonderful tools and they'll do wonderful things set during their presentations and while that statement is not a lie we can agree that the average Apple user isn't doing wonderful things with their iPhone or MacBook but by using every marketing tool available and sprinkling superlatives generously across its website and commercial Apple has successfully conjured an almost mystical aura around his products to make them seem more appealing than probably they are in real life it's absolutely gorgeous is the most beautiful expression with this beautiful custom table just incredibly beautiful materials it is so cool and so simple it's incredibly cool those that aren't lured by that aura however find it more appalling than appealing and for them it's all that is wrong with the modern world and our obsession with material goods spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for something that has much cheaper alternatives isn't acceptable for them and just plain wrong no brand should be put on a pedestal because they're all just parts of corporations looking for profit and speaking of putting on a pedestal reason number four because of Apple fans we've all had that experience where we like something but we find its fanbase so annoying that we'd rather stay away from it than risk being associated with it and for some people that's definitely true when it comes to Apple fans their devotion to the brand often reaches cult-like levels and the way they praise every new product released by the company no matter its objective qualities or faults can be a bit repulsive of course camping out in front of a store for a new gadget for your Instagram stories is also definitely not the kind of altruistic behavior that many people with indoors even if your feelings towards Apple are rather neutral encountering an Apple fan that's trying to convince you how amazing its products are as if they're receiving a cut from the profit make you dislike the brand reason number five because Apple is the other team people get oddly attached to the products they use despite the large corporations that provide them rarely reciprocating in any meaningful fashion des doubly true when it comes to tech and even more so when we narrow things down to smart phones smart phones have become such an essential part of our lives that if someone insults our a device of choice we take that as an insult to our personality when it comes to phones there are two very distinct teams apple or iOS and Android and while the Android team is fragmented into sub teams like Samsung LG one plus and so on when Apple is on the horizon new unite powers against the common enemy armed with facts biases or just plain insults they dive into battle sometimes the wrong logo on your smart phone is all that's needed to get sucked into an argument about which tech is superior reason number six because of Apple's questionable practices a massive con duty for Apple hate as some of its business practices that don't seem to match the company's rhetoric about they're doing everything with the users interests in mind slow charges in the boxes to nudge you to spend extra on faster ones sold separately low base storage an iPhone so you'd go for the more expensive version and battling the right of independent repair shops to fix broken Apple devices are just a few things that are objectively not in favor of users and yet are part of the company's handbook those are all legitimate reasons to dislike Apple and they have pushed a number of users away from its ecosystem over the years as you probably noticed they're all meant to inflate the company's profits or what people usually see as greed the fact is that no matter how noble apple's intentions may be it's still a publicly traded company and every quarter its executives have to bring good news to the investors or they'd be in trouble those are only a few of the reasons people usually hate Apple for there's an abundance of them and surely you've heard plenty more perhaps you're part of the anti Apple movement yourself no
