today we have another SmartWatch that aims to take a bite out of the Apple watch's market share the Fitbit Versa the comparison might not seem fair at first glance since the Apple watch series 5 starts at 400 and the Versa to at only 200 but when it comes to features that you are surprisingly close hi guys my name is Lilly with fawn arena and it's time to compare these two in detail starting with the physical appearance both smartwatches look somewhat similar aluminium bodies with rubber bands and a button on the side the Apple watch comes in two sizes and multiple different materials for the body but the prices for fancier ones quickly skyrocket the worse on the other hand is one size fits all but at least you can get different colors for the body the two small watch just comes with OLED displays but the bezels on the Versa are quite thick with cheapens it'll fit both brands offer a wide variety of interchangeable wrist bands and both have proprietary mechanisms for attaching them to the watch changing a ban on the verse that can be a pain and it does not feel intuitive but once you get the hang of it after a few attempts you should do okay with the Apple watch things are much more intuitive and easy when it comes to the watch faces things start to move in different directions both have always on this place but on the first thing you limit it to only two styles if you're using this feature a digital one and an analogue one that's a real bummer because there's some really cool watch faces for it that you hardly ever see meanwhile on the Apple watch every watch face has an always-on version that appears whenever you're not looking at it switching to another watch face is quite different on the two watches if you want a new design on the verse say you have to open the app on your phone select one and download it which can sometimes take a long time no matter if you've used it before or not with the Apple watch you can have a new watch face in just a second with a single sweat to the side when it comes to the watch faces themselves the verse allows for third-party ones so it has more variety but the quality is different matter and you don't have watch faces that are as informative or as beautiful as the ones on the Apple watch app will only allow security lineup of homemade faces to grace the display of its watch so don't have that much choice but what available really looks and functions great both watches come with a voice assistant Bolton the Apple watch with Siri as usual and Fitbit has opted to integrate Amazon's Alexa when you do ask for their help you're more likely to get an adequate answer from Siri than you are from Alexa and it seems to be faster too when it comes to apps the Apple watch takes another step forward not only you can install new apps straight from the watch but the variety and quality of them are much better fit vehicle system just isn't large enough to attract enough developers so the selection of apps where the Versa is limited and they're mostly focused on fitness speaking of fitness time to talk about the main features of these watches activity tracking [Music] both can measure heart rate steps calories burned and flight of stairs climbed the Apple watch has a trick up its sleeve and that's the ECG feature that can be used for early detection of heart conditions the Versa to retaliates with sleep tracking which su hasn't found its way to the Apple watch the two smartwatches detect exercises automatically but for better results you're better off selecting the type of workout yourself since the watch is often gets inaccurately what the activity was now for the category where the bursa too is the clear winner battery life even with they're always on display turned on the verso will easily go for at least two full days between charges and around double that if you turn it off the Apple watch will run for about a day and some change but since it's not tracking your sleep you might as well leave it on the charger overnight device has a couple of clever features that prevent it from disturbing you while you sleep so don't expect any accidental flashes in your eyes while dosing off so time for our predict the best thing about the first two is that it works with both Android and iOS plus it has a longer battery life but the Apple watch is clearly the superior watch it's noticeably faster it's better designed and more functional however if you don't mind a slower device that will still track your fitness sleep until the time the versa 2 is a good option as well and this wraps up our comparison of the Apple watch and the Fitbit Versa to which one would you go for let me know in the comments don't forget to give us a thumbs up subscribe to see more from us my name is Lilly this is phone arena and I will talk to you next time you [Music]
