some companies are making futuristic foldable phones that cost thousands of dollars yet LG is taking a different approach with the brand-new LG g8x Thank You it bundles an interesting dual screen case accessory that allows you to use the phone is basically a foldable device hello guys my name is Vic with phone marina and I got to spend some time with the LG G 8x thank you here at E for 2019 in Berlin and these are my first impressions now first the phone itself is barely any different from the regular LG G 8 that launched earlier this year features the same design it features a similar dual camera setup a same styling but it actually lacks some of the gimmicky features of the g8 for example that gesture motion control is gone it's not here on the g8 anymore but it does get to keep however are neat things like the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack which is quite the rarity on flagship phones these days it's also a powerful phone features a snapdragon 85 v chip 128 gigs of storage and so on but the real highlight here is that snap on case accessory now it is an accessory so you can buy separately but LG's idea is to sell the phone and the accessories bundled together on most carriers dual screen accessory is basically the same screen in addition to the main screen of the LG G 8 X thank you both are six point four inch beautiful AMOLED screens and both have a tiny teardrop notch LG could have had a second screen without a notch but it says that it uses the absolute same panels on both devices to ensure the absolute same color accuracy which makes sense the big benefit of this design is of course in multitasking where you can have two different apps running at the same time and you also have Chrome for example that runs across both screens which is really good for reading you can also use the secondary display as the custom game pad for gaming basically meaning that you can build your own custom game pad depending on the that you're playing and this is really neat for the gamers out there in terms of specs the OGG 8x thinkyou has a four thousand milliamp hour battery and the snap-on case does not have a battery so it relies on the battery of the phone itself the LG 8x think you should last about one point three days but if you use it with the dual screen accessory the battery life will drop slightly to a full day which is still quite reasonable now on the back of the phone you do have a dual camera setup you have the main camera 12 megapixel unit and a 13 megapixel ultra wide-angle camera unfortunately you are lacking a telephoto camera so you don't have the ability to zoom in with great clarity as many other flagship devices another interesting detail that LG has managed to do right on this phone is that it uses dual speakers set perfectly to the exact same volume so from the top and the bottom you get the same volume as for the case itself you've seen it on the LG v 50 but here it's improved another way so for example that hinge used to stand at certain angles and now it's a free pre moving 360 change that you can stop at any position and you can even have it in sort of a tent mode so it basically flips the full 360 degrees it were it feels very sturdy in the hands it's very well made we should also note that on the front of the snap-on case you also have a tiny 2.1 inch sticker display it's a monochrome display that shows you the time and some basic information and comes in handy in terms of biometrics and security you get an in display optical fingerprint scanner and then the phone itself is ip68 water protected and it has past military standard testing there are a few interesting camera features onboard here as well for example LG has built in an ASMR mode which is basically allows you to record sound and it boosts the sensitivity of the microphone three times to give you that capability reality the test changes that you know you now get stabilization on the sensor level so this is electronic image stabilization that works really well I will show the demo against popular competitors and the g8x think you really stood out as for the dual screen accessory you might be wondering what about third archeops well support for third-party apps is basically non-existent so you you can rely on the native apps the the LG camera the LG gallery app the whale browser that will support some new features with the Geo screen but third-party apps the for sure they are not optimized for this display the og g8x think you and it's dual screen accessory are coming to the market by the end of the fourth quarter of the year the price is not yet announced but we expect it to be as high as the price on other foldable devices so that's guys a quick look at these phones my name is Vic would phone arena follow us here on social media and Abu Dhabi loud phone ringer comp for more information about tech and muse and I will talk to you in the next video
