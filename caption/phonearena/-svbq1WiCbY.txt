these are the Samsung Galaxy S 20 and the S 20 plus the latest and greatest Falls by Samsung that leapfrog the iPhone with features like 5g connectivity huge batteries super smooth 120 Hertz displays and some cameras that Apple just doesn't have this year they come in the shadow of an even bigger samsung launched the galaxy s 20 ultra with third in the series a gigantic 6.9 inch phone with an even better camera and even longer battery life but here's the thing the sheer size of the ultra is just a bit extreme it's an overkill of a phone that costs a bit more than reasonable and while these two are expensive as well make no mistake these are the phones that most people will buy and for a good reason here's what makes the new Galaxy S 20 and s 20 plus special first let's talk size remember the super compact Galaxy S Denis from last year well that experiment is now officially over the new S 20 is now the smallest in the series and it's about the same size as last year's as 10 while the S 20 plus matches the size of the S 10 plus gone is the annoying Big Sleep button and now we have just the power key and the volume keys on the right the design is glass and metal familiar but with a few new colors now both holes are available in cosmic black and cosmic grey but you can also get the smaller s 20 in a pink version and the +1 in the blue version these are not just straight pink and blue colors but when light hits them you get a bit of a color gradient and they look very nice one thing is missing though the headphone jack you saw it coming Samsung first remove this from the Galaxy Note templates last year and now it's gone from all new Galaxy S 20 phones I would personally miss it but what about you are you over this let me know in the comments I know you can't wait to hear about the new camera but let's spend a moment talking about the screens because Samsung raised the bar here 6.2 inches on the s 26.7 inches on the Plus both the latest and greatest of Samsung AMOLED technology with lush colors perfect blacks and excellent viewing angles but also something else that you'll love 120 first with trade double the standard sixty Hertz that we used to have until now and it is a game changer it makes scrolling and just using your phone appears so much smoother okay the camera a brand new zoom lens so you can zoom up to thirty times a new super steady option improved night mode new sensors there is a lot to talk about but first let me show you the differences in camera specs against the s20 ultra the big gun that overshadows these phones a bit so instead of the new hundred and eight megapixel sensor on the ultra here you get a 12 megapixel main sensor what this means is you don't use the main camera for the flashy new 8k video mold on the s20 in the s20 plus but instead use the two times zoom telephoto one did you see all these differences laid out in detail here and so you probably wonder are they really dead significant it cannot tell you just yet as we need more time shooting with these phones but my first impressions are the zooming 10 or 100 times is cool but not exactly necessary every time having a three times hybrid optical zoom like on the s20 and up to 30 times digital one might just be enough for many people and next let's also talk about batteries and 5g because yes both the s20 and the plus support 5g incompatible markets both supports sub six and millimeter wave bands and they have big batteries for that you have four thousand milliamp hour battery and yes 20 in the 45 hundred million power cell on the + and all of this while they remain extremely thin at just 0.3 inches fast charging is also on board and you have the newer second-generation fast wireless charging as well the processor is snapdragon 865 on both phones which means top level performance and you also get 8 gigabytes of RAM on the base model there's also version with 12 gigabytes of RAM if you want the absolute best and this will depend on the market so some markets may get one and others on the other now what else you have an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor built inside the screen to unlock the phone fortunately we did not get to test that not sure how it works but is there you also have 128 gigabytes of on-board storage plus support for micro SD card actually here is the full spec sheet pause this video and take a close look if you really want the nitty gritty at the end of the day the galaxy s 20 and the s 20 plus are not something crazy and brand new like a foldable phone but they give users just what users want longer battery life 120 Hertz super smooth screens versatile camera that can zoom and capture great detail 5g connectivity and Samsung also throws in a pair of its new wireless butts plus with the Galaxy S 20 plus for free so the prices of the new S 20 are also more expensive than ever but these phones pull no punches so this wraps up our first look at the Galaxy has 20 and the galaxy has 20 plus do you have
