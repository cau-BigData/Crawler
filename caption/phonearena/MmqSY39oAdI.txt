hello everyone Vick here with folder inna and our choice for today's game compilation won't surprise anyone battle royale games have been popping up like mushrooms after rain for all platforms and smartphones are no exception the genre is pretty straightforward you have a bunch of players and only one can be the winner which means everyone else has to die many of the titles on our lists are trying to replicate the experience offer by the genres most popular games so don't be surprised by the similarities some more have gone their own way and feel like a breath of fresh air that being said let's begin with the first of our top 10 best battle royale games rocket Royale rocket Royale has an extremely familiar look but comes with a unique twist in the gameplay being the last one standing is not necessary instead you have to build your own rocket and get the hell out of the island before someone whacks you that's easier said than done however first you need to collect resources from all over the map then you have to find a few peaceful moments for building not easy with 24 enemies lurking around we can do your own fortress to keep others at bay and use a wide variety of weapons to straight up remove them from the pool of competitors if you want to try something more unusual give rocket for you our goal next up we have battle lands Royale besides the goofy graphics battle lands Royale has another thing that makes it pretty unique is the only game on this list that gives the player a top-down view of the battlefield instead of the standard first or third person camera this of course greatly simplifies the aiming and makes the game a lot more casual than the rest games are also shorter so no need to wonder if starting one who have you pinned to your phone for 10 or 30 minutes 5 minutes is all you need in battle lands real jump and start shooting get out easy as that you don't like the standard rules no problem create your own custom games hop in with your friends and wait until others join to start the fun next up on the list cyber hunter cyber hunter is a game with graphics and futuristic weapons but that's not the most interesting thing about it besides the usual shooting with machine guns and sniper rifles cyber hunter adds another element to the combat parkour that's right your character can climb buildings jump and roll around as if they're alive penning on it because does if you ever wonder the - of Assassin's Creed into your battle royale experience this is the game for you but cyber hunter has another trick up his sleeve using energy from the quantum cubes you can find around the map you can create powerful devices and you know structures that will help you get the W at the end of the day a good aim is still what matters most so start practicing next on the list is bullet league you might be surprised to hear that there is such a thing as battle royale platformer well there is and bullet league is just that a 2d shooter that will pitch you against other players in a nostalgia inducing environment the 2d setting means that the game will run without a hitch on pretty much any smartphone which cannot be said for some of the heavier titles on this list the art of this game is creative and amusing at the same time and it gives you a casual feel while you jump around shooting machine guns at your cartoonish rivals we applaud the developers for giving us something so refreshing in the battle royale genre mix 1 / dog software Docs is another game in which you're controlling your character from above but this time there is no shooting going on characters fight with melee weapons in gladiator style arenas that shrink as time goes by as is tradition besides your weapon of choice you have two skill slots you can populate with abilities you feel will be the most helpful to defeat the other 11 fighters apart from surviving during each round you also have to collect coins or you might not make it to the final area even if you're still alive when it unlocks upgrades and character customizations are plentiful so there's plenty of things to waste your hard earned currency on next comes creative destruction creative destruction is another beautiful looking game that bets on the proven formula flying the eco you jump from an island to destructible buildings and of course constructing ramps and barriers whack your weapons with different rarities are also on board and so as a dedicated FPS mode barring a team with other players or go solo it's up to you the game is regularly updated with new content in advance to keep the game playing from becoming stale if you like the gameplay Fortnite provides but don't want to be associated with it in any way then creative destruction is the best alternative there next up we have super mecha champions will let you guess what the unique mechanic of this game is that's right there are max and the game is everything you were imagining it to be you start with one of the regular flesh over bones characters and have to earn your right to pile up a fearsome robot shooting enemies riding hoverboards and eventually hiding behind buildings or flying over them to find the remaining enemies this game has it all it's tons of fun and if you're a fan of the Japanese pop culture already you'll love it for sure one warning though the game is quite large over two gigs so make sure you have enough space on your phone before you get all enthusiastic about it coming to the last three games you probably already know which ones they are but that doesn't mean we can afford to skip them so here is the Battle Royale try under 8 Call of Duty mobile Call of Duty came late to the battle royale stage but with the massive following the franchise has it quickly overshadowed if not for tonight then at least pop G with graphics as good as they get on mobile multiple game modes and high paced action Co D mobo has rightfully earned the reputation of one of the best shooters for smartphones and what's more thrilling than 100 people armed to the teeth fighting for survival run them over with the vehicle blow them up with a grenade or snipe them from half a mile away the opportunities are endless the popularity of Call of Duty ensures you never have to spend much time waiting in lobbies which is always a plus but maybe you're not into some of the arcade elements Call of Duty adds to the action and prefer to play one of the og battle Royales pop G bets on realism whenever possible while still providing engaging gameplay good graphics
