are you looking to buy a phone that is not only fast and has a great camera but also features truly long lasting battery life here at phone arena all phones that we review go through a series of three different battery tests that form a comprehensive picture of how long a battery will last in this video we will go through the five longest lasting flagship phones right now in 2020 but if you're curious to learn about the exact battery scores for many other phones make sure to open the description box and follow the link to our website phone arena comm where you can find the battery life of many other phones with that in mind let's get started at number five on our list is a phone you have all heard about the iPhone 11 pro max after years of shipping iPhones with lower batteries than Android counterparts Apple finally did something with the pro max which now features a nearly 4,000 milliamp hour battery and you can see this reflected in the battery scores the iPhone 11 pro max lasts nearly 13 hours of non-stop use for browsing around the web and for other light use which is an outstanding score if you don't use it heavily it will easily last you two days between charges however we found that it's battery drops much quicker if you watch a lot of YouTube videos and in fact the pro max scored nearly nine hours on our YouTube video test not quite as long as many Samsung phones for instance finally if you play a lot of games on your phone stuff like fortnight pub G or other 3d games the iPhone lasts us 7 hours and 30 minutes on our gaming test which again is not quite as much as others overall the iPhone 11 pro max gets the number 5 spot for longest lasting flagship phones in 2020 lasting a really long time with average use but draining quicker if you use it to watch a lot of videos and especially when playing games next up we have two of the most popular Android phones around the galaxy s 20 and the galaxy s 20 plus equipped with a four thousand milliamp hours battery for the smaller s 20 and a 4500 mm amp-hours cell for the larger s twenty-plus and the galaxy s 20 is in fact the only compact phone to make this list so good job on this Samsung the galaxy s 20 series scored particularly well for youtube video streaming lasting 10 hours and 20 minutes of non-stop video playback for the s 20 and nearly 10 hours for the s 20 plus and they both lasted over 12 hours on our light use web browsing test however there is one thing to keep in mind and that's that the new 120 Hertz refresh rate option that gives you that super smooth experience but at a huge battery cost switching the 120 Hertz option obliterates battery life on these phones and they drop out of this ranking so if you want to fully enjoy the long battery life of the s 20 series you have to use them at the 60 Hertz default refresh rate option at number 3 we have a very exciting phone the one plus 8 which is also the cheapest on this list of high-end devices as it costs just $700 the oneplus 8 comes with a 4300 milliamp hours battery cell which is not the biggest around but it gets the job done as the phone scores over 12 hours on our browsing tests around 9 hours and 40 minutes of YouTube video streaming and more than 10 hours for 3d gaming and the gaming score is particularly impressive as the phone stays cool and is able to run even the most demanding games smoothly so it's a perfect choice for gamers keep in mind that the oneplus 8 also has a higher refresh rate mode at 90 Hertz for the screen which gives you a smoother and more enjoyable experience with a moderate effect on battery it drops around 10% at 90 Hertz with this we were approaching the two very best high-end phones in terms of battery life so far in 2020 and the number two spot goes to the samsung galaxy s 20 altra a phone with a massive five thousand milliamp hours battery cell the largest in this list the s 20 ultra scores excellent all around but with one important condition you have to use it at the 60 Hertz refresh rate and not the fancy new 120 Hertz mode which if enabled drains your battery faster often by as much as 30% so the s20 ultra is the second longest lasting phone in 2020 but only if you use it at 60 Hertz and finally the winner who scored highest on our battery tests is drumroll xiaomi me 10 pro xiaomi has grown a lot in the past few years and while it's mostly known for making budget devices its latest high-end phone really steps up the battery game with a 40 500 milliamp hours battery this phone does not have the biggest battery cell but it seems that Xiaomi is able to do some aggressive tweaks of the Android interface and get excellent results out of this cell the Xiaomi me Tim Pro scores above all other phones on our web browsing and YouTube streaming test and falls just a bit shy of the oneplus for 3d gaming it's a true battery beast it's worth mentioning that most phones in this list are big phones with big battery cells and that definitely helps with battery life and this wraps up our list of the longest lasting high-end phones of 2020 which one is your favorite let us know in the comments also don't hesitate to hit that
