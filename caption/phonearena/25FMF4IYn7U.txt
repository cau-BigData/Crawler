so that's the iPhone se it looks infused just like the iPhone 8 and if you put the two side-by-side and ask me which one is which I honestly wouldn't be able to tell so ok ever went lazy on the design and this new iPhone se is basically an iPhone 8's but there's a reason why Apple doing such tricks can still sell millions of iPhones and that's what I want to talk to you about hello guys my name is Vic and you're with phone arena and here's why this phone that looks like it's from the past is getting such a big hype first is got the Apple 13 Bionic chip on the inside and it calls just $400 not just that but it's also got a main camera that apart from not supporting night mode is basically just as good as the camera on the most expensive iPhone 11 Pro Series and these two combined at the price of just $400 just don't happen tolls in the same price range are usually Samsung Galaxy S series that feature mid-range processors and cameras these are just average at best so let's talk briefly about these packs the FOI 13 Bionic chip inside runs everything without breaking a sweat here's a comparison between the Galaxy S tourney Samsung's last year flagship that is still more expensive than the iPhone se today and yet it has lower benchmark scores this also translates into gaming as the iPhone se is able to run even the latest titles at 60 frames per second and without dropping a frame but there is a caveat there the to touch upon in a moment and the next thing that is great about the new SE is that camera tear downs have shown that basically the sensor is the same one as on the 8 and some people have jumped to the conclusion that the camera is the same that is not true at all and there is a very noticeable difference take a look at this shot from the iPhone 8 and then compare it against the iPhone S II it's a night and day difference and that's because the se uses the latest generation smart HDR feature that older iPhones don't have here are a few shots that we captured on the iPhone se in different conditions and in my opinion all of them look quite good now speaking of different conditions there is no night mode on this phone and if you take a lot of photos at night the similarly priced Google pixel 3ei might be a better option with its night sight feature and the pixel 4a is also coming soon the camera on the SE however is great for video it records 4k video at up to 60 frames per second something that no other phone in this price range offers and thanks to the fast processor you can also do some quick edits on the video on the go easily on your phone colors detail focusing everything looks great on the video part and the third thing that I want to touch upon is iOS yes it's a world garden that doesn't have all the customization options and the file access that Android provides but if you don't really need that the iOS experience is easy to accustomed to if you're switching from Android it also comes with regular software updates for years to come most likely five years for this iPhone and it integrates easily with the popular air pods Apple watch another made for iPhone accessories last but not least you have that taptic engine hippos fancy name for its vibration motor which provides extremely nice and articulate haptic feedback again no other Android phone has such nice and clear vibration in this price range and that's important if your device is often buzzing with notifications all day okay so far I have only mentioned the great things about this new iPhone se but it's not all roses the biggest issue I have encountered while using it is that battery life is just not great at all now this is not unexpected as the se features an extremely small 1821 million power battery while most other phones of a similar size these days have a battery of around 3000 milliamp hour capacity and often even more now I'm running our battery testing here at fawn arena and the iPhone se has so far ranked as the phone with worst battery life this year take a look at these numbers now if you're just using your phone to browse the web and do social media battery life will be fine not great but it will last you through the day on most occasions however if you're watching videos or even worse playing games the iPhone se battery melts like butter in the Sun for example the Google pixel 3:8 lasted us six hours and 30 minutes of non-stop YouTube video playback while the iPhone se only lasted 4 hours and 45 minutes and the Samsung Galaxy 851 for example another rival phone lasted 8 hours and 36 minutes on this very same test nearly twice as long as the iPhone se and even though the SE has the faster chip what good is a fast chip if you cannot use it for long gaming sessions for playing pop G or even minecraft it drains the battery in no time ok and then you have that super slow 5 watt charger in the box another remnant of the past it takes 2 hours and a half to charge the phone but thankfully the SE does support fast charging you just need to buy a fast charger with support for the USB power delivery standard and you get much faster charging speeds which are great for a quick battery top-up if you forgot to charge your phone overnight and speaking of charging the SE also supports wireless charging which is very convenient and a nice extra that you don't get on other phones in this price range so battery life is my biggest complaint about the SE but it's not the only one second on the list comes the screen now it's a 4.7 inch one and it has big bezels around it which looks just dated it also has a very low 750 P resolution so when you read text it appears pixelated and not perfectly sharp but honestly that's not even the bigger problem what bothers me more is that this is an LCD screen while rivals like the Google pixel and galaxy a series use AMOLED screens that look much better these newer screens have more vibrant and rich colors but also they refresh faster while with LCD screens you get noticeable motion blur when scrolling around overall all the screens are the technology of the future and the LCD of the past and the iPhone se is stuck in the past and this brings me to my final thoughts the iPhone se is a great phone but it's not one for me if you are a smartphone enthusiast it might also not be for you it's a phone for your parents for your grandparents and for your kids it has a button which one important politician will like it's easy to use its battery is only okay if you don't use it a lot it's also got a small screen and there is no large screen option at all so it's perfect if you want a phone to help you fight that smartphone addiction which definitely is a real thing and for all of that it's perfect it's also super capable small camera but if you are a heavy smartphone user you have some great options that will give you a bigger and better screen and certainly a much better battery experience if you ask me for those options I would point you towards the Google pixel a series with their great camera we won plus 70 now costs only $500 and it has all the modern bells and whistles and is also a great alternative and if you want a super compact Android phone the Galaxy S 10 II is now available for just a bit more than $500 so there you have it our iPhone se 2020 Edition review a phone that is a weird mixture of super impressive modern technology combined with super old design and extremely tiny battery so what do you think are you tempted by the new se are you buying one for yourself let me know your thoughts about the SE
