fresh off its worldwide developer conference in 2019 or simply dub dub DC Apple has unveiled iOS 13 the newest version of the iPhone operating system and while users who have to wait until the fall when all the bugs are ironed out and the software is fully ready developers can try it out right now we have just installed iOS 13 on our iPhone 10 are here and it's a lot of fun but before we dive in the details we should warn you that this is a very early beta and that you probably should not try it out just yet especially if it's your main device the one feature that apple says it focused on was to keep improving the performance making apps not only load quicker but also making them faster to download from the App Store one other thing that Apple has improved in IRS 13 is face ID unlock speeds which are now up to 30% faster and you can see right here in our demo that the iPhone 10 are with iOS 13 indeed unlocks a little bit faster than the iPhone 10s with iOS 12 the big news with iOS 13 is dark mode it's a brand new system-wide option that turns backgrounds in settings and practically all first party apps made by Apple and dark and it looks gorgeous you can enable it manually via control center and a long press on the brightness slider or via the display menu in settings we also love that dark mode can be set to automatically start at sunset or at a preset time so you don't have to manually switch it on and off every single time third-party apps will also get the option to support dark mode so expect a lot of apps turning darker this fall with dark mode you also get four new wallpapers on the iPhone all of them look great and change as you switch between the modes unfortunately the one place where you would probably need dark mode the most in the browser does not fully support it or at least it doesn't transform the background of webpages to a dark background you'd also notice that icons all throughout iOS are now a bit thicker and better contrasted a welcome change the second big new feature is support for swipe typing on the native keyboard now this is a feature that Android phones have had for years while iPhones only supported swipe typing via third-party apps now finally you can do swipe typing on the native keyboard into words great Beppo has also graded the momochi avatars and you can now create a more fun and personal representation of yourself those avatars who also serve as profile pictures for iMessage and with every avatar you get a selection of stickers that you can use across different apps a small but welcome improvement comes to the volume slider it's no longer obstructing the view right in the center but instead appears more elegant and gentle to the side a single click on the volume keys gives you a bigger on-screen bar that you can drag with your fingers while further clicks will minimize it Apple has also improved a few of its native apps the one that got the biggest new features is reminders where you can now tag people create sub lists and just do a lot more the health app in iOS 13 is also much richer and provides a lot and better organized detail new here is cycle tracking for women which is done within the health app and is very clearly and well laid out so women will not need to use third-party apps for that we should also mention that the new Photos app gives you four different views so you can explore your photos better it looks great and the previous change with time so you can see what happened in the same exact period last year and earlier editing photos has also become much easier in the app with cleaner and more precise controls in the form of dials you also have a new intelligent sharing menu all throughout the system which is much tidier and more intuitive and it looks like a vertical list with a few suggestions at the top there is a bunch of other new features too you can now connect to separate pairs of air paths to the same device it seems that Apple is replacing 3d touch with long taps there is a new protection from spam colors that puts those messages there breaking into your voicemail Apple is introducing a new alternative to social silence from Facebook and Google with a new sign-in with Apple service that is completely private doesn't track you and the list of features just goes on and on the new iOS 13 is rolling out this fault to the iPhone 6s iphone se and newer iPhones which means that the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 have reached the end of their software update cycle and will forever remain on iOS 12 overall this is a big big update for iPhone users that improves the performance of the system and brings welcome new features we can't wait to see it arrive to millions of iPhones this fall and this runs up our first look at i/o s 13 beta 1 let us know your thoughts about the new look of iOS my name is Vic now we'll talk to you next time right here on fall Nerina [Music]
