of the best strategy games for Android and iOS and we start with the roll total war barbarian invasion total war is one of the most popular strategy game franchises and fans of the game can enjoy the familiar gameplay on their phones without sacrificing much of course the smaller display does make positioning your armies on the battlefield more challenging but that's nothing an experienced commander can to deal with the game will cost you 5 bucks but for the quality and gameplay depth that you're getting with it it's worth the price next up is grow umpires Romans another wrong team strategy game but this one is not only free but also much more lighthearted with it's cartoonish visuals gameplay can be best described as a combination of tower defense and tower offense you have to defend your capital from invaders but you can also conquer other towns to gain more resources unfortunately as with most other free mobile games there are some premium currencies involved it can be purchased with real money but even without them you'll be able to slowly grow your empire number three we have civilization 6 another well-known name in the strategy genre is usual you start with a small town thousands of years before Christ and set on a journey through the ages until you build a modern day in megapolis the game might be too complex for the casual gamer but fans of the franchise will be glad to see the mobile version is as close as possible to his desktop variant if you find yourself with hours to kill civilization 6 will make them pass in a breeze unfortunately Civ 6 is iOS only for now next up we've got war commander rogue assault or Commander is set in a more modern environment where you're tasked with completing various missions with your force of elite specialists you can train units purchase enough great vehicles and expand your base the graphics are a bit retro but the game is entered lest the next strategy game you should try is age of ottoman speaking of graphics age of ottoman won't value with its visuals at least they provide plenty of entertainment combined with the voice acting the game is good where it counts which is the battles you won't see hundreds of Units marching in order instead your futuristic warriors who have to be used optimally in order to complete the mission at hand another one who loved playing is dawn of titans strategy game dawn of titans is on the opposite end of the spectrum compared to Age of Ottomans the graphics are impressive for a smartphone title and not only do you get to control legions of units but you also have a Titan on your side equipped with unique skills and abilities there are many aspects to this game including developing your town and keeping an eye on what other players near you are up to we march forward with dominations dominations is a pleasant looking game that follows a familiar concept you build up your town send troops to destroy and loot other towns so you can train more troops upgrade buildings and unlock all sorts of goodies you have more control over the battles than usual with this type of game so there is definitely some skill involved the game is not just about waiting for timers so you can amass the needed resources for the things you want to do next comes mech com3 mech country is a real-time strategy with a simplified unit design and gameplay that reminds you of StarCraft you gather resources build factories and units and try to outmaneuver your AI opponent that's doing the same somewhere else on the map from micromanaging units to choosing tech trees this game provides everything you can expect from a real-time strategy the best part is that despite costing only a dollar this game has no ads or enough purchases next up we have iron Marines another starcraft inspired RTS game with a cool looking cartoonish graphics the main campaign offers 21 missions that get progressively harder and you also have created stages if you want to complete all of the available content iron marines will provide you with many hours of entertain gameplay and the developers keep making improvements to it another great game you should give a try is battle plants battle plans takes you to a well-designed mythical world where you fight for control over islands traversing between them on the backs of huge turtles you assemble your squads choose a destination to conquer and set out to destroy the enemy's defenses after that comes the best part getting the loot and deciding how you want to use it as you move on the battles will become challenging and victory harder to achieve so you better be smart about how you're developing your army next up we have bad land brawl bad land brawl is stretching the definition of strategy games a bit but it's fun to play so we threw it in the selection as well using a combination of gadgets and units your goal is to destroy your opponent's tower before he does the same to yours upgrades and ammunition can be obtained by opening eggs which are essentially loot boxes and while the game has a simple concept you'll have to be quick and accurate with your moves and have a solid strategy prepared beforehand if you want to bring devastation successfully next counts plagg incorporated are you sick of pretty colorful game worlds with upbeat music accompanying your every move well flag I&C is a stark contrast from all of that your goal is simple kill everyone on earth how by creating the ultimate deadly disease with all sorts of pathogens and mutations of a robot your disposal bringing death to humans worldwide is way more entertaining than you'd have imagined another strategy game we recommend is incursion tower defense as it becomes clear from the name incursion tower defense is part of the ever-popular tower defense genre besides just placing towers and waiting to see what will happen you also get to command your main character and his trusty puppy alongside various other units that can move across the map and help in a pinch the levels are diverse and well designed so it should be quite hard to get bored next up is all the chests all the chests exploded in popularity in 20 and from its success sprung a whole new sub-genre of strategy games by creating combinations of heroes and formations and placing them on a classic 8x8 chessboard you spar against one of your seven opponents each round and this one the Auto part comes in its units fight on their own and to only members of one team remain of course there is some luck involved but each player strategy is what will ultimately bring success or failure last but not least we have dota under Lords valve was quick to create Delta under Lords after the release of auto chess the games are similar but valve has brought some unique features to under Lord and of course it uses the familiar heroes and skills from dota 2 both dota under Lords and auto chests are extremely popular right now so opponents are easy to find and your
