the OAP 40 pro is the new kid on the camera block and it's eager to fight in the never-ending camera wars with an imposing new camera system that consists of a gigantic sensor for the main camera as well as a periscope lens that allows it to zoom far and away we took the opportunity to compare it against two of the finest phones on the market the Samsung Galaxy S 20 ultra and the FOI found 11 pro max so let's take a look at the photos one of the main advantages the YP 40 pro has is that periscope lens that allows you to get a clean shot even when you zoom far away that's exactly what we did here and we indeed see that the P 40 pro does an excellent job at 10 times zoom it captures an image that is practically free of noise and one that looks good at that we notice a few minor issues mostly the photo is a bit underexposed and detail was a bit smudged but overall good job the Galaxy S 20 ultra does well to but noise is clearly more visible than the iPhone though it clearly doesn't belong in the same category as the other tool it lacks a periscope lens and you can tell by the grainy image jumping next to five times zoom level the Yop 40 pro shows class the photograph just looks great the s 20 ultra seems to be just slightly behind it has a bit less internal in terms of detail the iPhone is again clearly not in the same league the phone will capture it has a bunch of noise and grain and this is the one we are least likely to share and here's the way this scene looked when seen with the main camera on each of the phones zooming ten times is actually quite a lot the p40 Pro can go all the way to 50 times zoom and the ultra can go to a hundred times zoom but we found the quality just terrible when you go over 30 times zoom and those are not photos you want to share with anyone now one more example of the way photos look at 10 times zoom interestingly this time the Huawei has captured an overexposed image as it seems to be struggling a bit with nailing the right exposure keep in mind that we had an early unit provided by Huawei and the company may update the camera the galaxy s 20 ultra has a lot more in terms of color and appeal but again it's no match for the Poway in terms of result detail the iPhone is just a blurry mess at 10 times zoom ever wants to match the other two in the zoom game it will need to have the ante at five times zoom you get a well detailed and clean image from the p40 pro but it loses points for the overexposed look as everything basically appears washed out the galaxy s 20 ultra has captured the best photo here with a good amount of color contrast and overall appeal the iPhone is still no match for the others at this five times zoom level let's also take a look at two times zoom and you immediately noticed that the dedicated two times telephoto lens on the iPhone elevates it to the number one position here the other phones use digital zoom all the way into the periscope lens kicks in at exactly four point seven times zone for the p40 Pro and it's four times zoom for the s20 ultra the iPhone captures more detail the image has very nicely balanced colors that look realistic and appealing and this is how the same scene looked when shot with the main camera and all the phones okay we have seen that the p40 pro leads the way with the zoom camera but what about this main camera don't want that you're likely to be using most of the time you will immediately notice some things that will repeat in the coming images as well the exposure is way too bright colors are a bit on the pale side with the yellow tonality is way over exaggerated in detail is also on the soft side on the POW a p40 pro but at least it's not as artificially over sharpened as on the galaxy s2 an ultra now speaking of the s20 ultra it has the strongest most vibrant colors these are not realistic finalities damage you see he's larger than life and weight to live it his if it was already edited some people may like this effect but we find it a bit extreme the iPhone on this part captures balanced photos with pleasing colors in detail that is neither too soft nor too harsh something strange happened without us noticing when we switch to using the ultra wide camera on the 40/40 Pro automatically change the aspect ratio to a different one sixteen by nine for a narrower photo we did not expect that that's why the photos here if you're a bit different and you won't be surprised by the images and the colors the walk before the probe continues the trend with Bleeker colors in a slightly overexposed look it's a specific look that some may like but objectively it lines the dynamic range and the depth of color from the other two in this next we'll travel 400 of the beach is one final confirmation the boy before he pretends to capture will detailed photos with a specific look to them as colors are slightly washed out and not as saturated the galaxy again captures a punchy photo and finally the iPhone strikes a kind of a balance between these two next this photo was captured at dusk but it doesn't look like that because all of the phones will do an excellent job and are able to deal with the low-light and still get a bright and good looking image there are a few minor differences but they're really insignificant and we would say that all three the similarly great job in this case it's a draw in this next photo you see some trends starting to emerge the galaxy for example captures the darkest photo at night while the other two phones are able to get a lot more light in the frame and look a bit better as night falls and light gets extremely scarce we get a good opportunity to see how these phones perform in extreme conditions we use the automatic settings here on all the phones and the p40 Pro is clearly the one that captured the most light and the brightest photo he's done a great job and we like that image gathered to capture a darker image especially the galaxy where the shadows are very dark there's barely any detail in them using the although settings again in this next scene we see that the Huawei captures the most light in this capture as well the iPhone is a bit behind in terms of amount of light but it also retains a bit of that orange tint it looks a bit strange not quite accurate and true to life finally the galaxy captures the darkest image again that lacks details in the shadows and the other tools seem to do a better job in this next shot there are some clear differences while the Huawei p40 Pro has cap the most of the sulfa at the bottom of the image scholars are very bleak and could use a lift the galaxy seems to capture more balanced image while the iPhone capture is a very contrasted photo it catches the eye it's a task between the galaxy and the iPhone in this round with a slight advantage for the iPhone for this next photo we manually enabled the night mode on all of the phones to see whether it would make a difference this is not something that we would do for every image Huawei and the Samsung devices take a very long time to capture a photo when using the night mode manually and waiting so long for every shot it's definitely not convenient still you do get a brighter photo with more detail if you have the patience to wait we also finally captured the selfie at dusk to get an idea of how the front camera would do and the selfie from the Huawei actually stands out from the rest it's got more detail and looks sharper while the Samsung in the iPhone look a bit blurry and not as clean the colors on the Galaxy are also bleak and not particularly exciting while the iPhone does a better job with warmer more pleasing tonalities in the shot but would still just this one in favor of the Huawei with all of this it's time to wrap up is the Huawei p40 pro the new smartphone camera King that we've all been waiting for now it's an absolutely stellar phone if you care about it cool ability to zoom in far in a way it captures more detail than the more expensive s20 ultra with this periscope camera which is an achievement worth mentioning it's got that large sensor also this provides plentiful detail let me just look clean even at night one area where we wish well we would improve the photos is the colorscience is it me just often come out overexposed and with colors that look a bit bleak and washed out now the Galaxy S 20 ultra might have lost the zoom battle by a tiny bit but it's still great camera that stands out with those strong saturated colors finally the iPhone the most conservative camera in this comparison loses badly when it comes to the zoom battle but if you take just its main camera that you will be using most of the time it's an incredibly good performer captures well balanced photos with a great amount of detail and colors that are dynamic and just look beautiful so which one is your favorite let me know in the comments my name is Vic this is for narita thanks watching this and I will see you in the next one [Music]
