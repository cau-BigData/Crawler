which is the best smartphone that you can buy right now and why is it better than the others hello Internet Vic with phone marina here and it's time to round up the best phones in the first half of 2019 and look at their pros and cons so let's waste no time and start with number five on our list which is the wow ep3 pro the p30 pro has one big downside it's not available in the United States and even worse it has fallen prey to the Trump trade war with China so it's not quite certain whether it will get updates in the future it seems however that it will but even this aside the Peterlee Pro is a stellar phone which has the best battery life of any flagship phone in 2019 it is also the only phone out there that has the native 5 times zoom lens and you can get a good quality zoom at up to the amazing ten times level zoom couple this with Wow is impressive night mode it captures light and absolute darkness and you get a good camera phone with excellent battery life and solid performance the few downsides of the p30 pro include the somewhat clunky emui custom interface and you don't quite get the lush colors that you get with the display of Samsung phones but those are definitely not deal-breakers moving further down to number four we have the Google pixel 3 series which are sold at a discount and are an absolute steal for those looking for an amazing camera the pixel 3 series use the Google camera algorithm to create images with unmatched dynamic range and the nitesite option allows you to capture images even when your eyes cannot see head to that years of software updates delivered the moment Google releases them and the clean interface that works super smoothly and you have a very strong contender in the Google pixel 3 series and if you're wondering between the smaller and the larger XL version the XL model not only features a bigger screen but also has longer battery life too if number 3 on this list comes the Apple iPhone 10 s max the biggest iPhone has the unfortunate characteristic of being the most expensive mainstream phone out there it's price starting at the outrageous $1,100 and going up to as much as fourteen hundred and fifty dollars if you are ready to invest that much in the phone though the iPhone tennis mask is a few advantages over all other phones first and foremost it's a phone that will last you more than the rest Apple is the only company that can provide timely updates for four five sometimes even longer years hippo also makes its own chips and the performance here is better than on any other phone this is a perfect phone for gamers too not just because of the graphics power but because games are well optimized for it and the Apple AppStore simply has more high quality games especially when it comes to indie games battery life on the 10s max is decent but not quite great and the camera is good but lies the versatility that Android phones offer with their ultra wide lenses and night modes now if you don't have the cash or don't want the phone edge gigantic as the 10s max the more affordable iPhone 10 are sacrifices screen resolution for a better battery life and has the same stellar performance and good camera game the smaller iPhone 10 has on the other hand is a very ergonomic device but its battery life is a bit below the average getting closer to the top at number two on our list we have the samsung galaxy s 10 series the galaxy s 10 plus here gets a slightly better battery life than the S 10 but the smaller s 10 is just more compact and easier to operate with one hand both these phones have amazing high quality high resolution screens that look absolutely gorgeous Samsung's interface has also improved a good view recently the cameras produced consistently excellent results and the bigger downside here are which you still get a bit of a stutter here and there less than before but still a bit and then the update situation as the galaxies are late to get updates and should not count on more than two major updates at best and finally finally at the top of our list and our pick for the best phone so far in 2019 is the one plus a non-pro one plus is truly created something special here but the phone that features one of the best AMOLED screens that we have ever seen with beautiful colors and running at a refresh rate of 90 Hertz which makes everything appear as if it was running with perfect smoothness and speed oneplus also has a clean Android interface it performs incredibly well the company has team dedicated to shaving off every millisecond of lag and you can tell this by beat performance the camera is excellent too maybe lacking a tiny bit in its color science when compared to the very best out there but it captures generally very good looking photos and videos oneplus also gets the little details right it offers a very useful mute switch it features a brand-new vibration motor that brings haptics the level of the taptic engine on iPhones which is really good and the list goes on and on and best of all that full package comes at a price starting at just $700 much less than the $1000 you need to pay for most other phones on this list and this runs up our list of the best phones that you can buy right now in 2019 some good phones like the Google pixel 3a the LG G a thank you and the few 5g handsets the Xperia Wan did not make the cut but they certainly offer their own unique features TV just not as many as the phones right here on this list and we're sure you will tell us why you think some other phone deserves to be here in this list
