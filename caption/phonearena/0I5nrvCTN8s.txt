this year smartphone market is basically down to a two platform race with blackberry gone the way of Android and Windows 10 mobile pretty much nowhere to be found it's an Android versus iOS showdown already this year we've seen the launch of some fantastic Android hardware including blazingly fast flagships phones with all-day battery life and even the rise of modular phones that puts some big pressure on Apple to deliver with its new iPhones for the past few months now we've been tracking rumors of what to expect from this new hardware and earlier this month we saw Apple finally make things official with the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus but these models deliver on the big expectations or does Apple maybe phone it in with an underwhelming upgrade well you're about to find out as we take a close look at the smaller of the two new iPhones I'm Steven shank with phone arena and you're watching my review of the iPhone 7 Apple's approach with its latest hardware is one we've seen before well apples hardly the only company conducting its smartphone design in such a manner it's arguably the company that's doing it the best with the iPhone 7 Apple looks to bring shoppers a phone that's intimately familiar as soon as they pick the handset up but they're gonna know this is my next iPhone and yet the same time so it gives loyal users more of what they've come to expect the iPhone 7 doesn't shy away from going out in some new directions including something that might be a little uncomfortable all in the name of progress is that Apple attitude of knowing what its customers want before they know themselves and while there's a potential for conflict there this time it pretty much works the iPhone 7 delivers a design that builds directly off what we saw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s returning with the same sort of sleek rounded edge handset and while feels a heck of a lot like last year's model Apple's tweaking its phone's construction in some important ways moving the iPhones and tennis stripes towards the edges of the back panel helps drastically clean up the phone's design and some smart color matching at least here are this black iPhone 7 really lets those lines vanish into the background speaking of colors Apple's switching things up this year ditching the familiar Space Gray and replacing it with a pair of new darker shades the matte black you see here and a shiny new jet black of proving impossibly hard to come by that scarcity is reinforced by jet black only being available on high storage capacity 128 and 2 56 gigabyte models but even if we can't get our hands on jet-black just yet this new black color option is pretty darn attractive on its own it makes a nice addition to existing silver gold and rose gold finishes the iPhone 7s external dimensions are in your perfect match for the iPhone 6s but apples managed to shave a little bit off the phone's weight with this new model coming in five grams lighter than last year's component layout is a close match to the iPhone success but not without a few adjustments here and there staying around back the phone's camera bump gets a makeover instead of the raised element with its comparatively sharp edges of last year's phone the iPhone 7 picks up a much more gradual sloping protrusion one that Rises smoothly up from the handsets back around front things look very familiar but looks can be deceiving that home button looks just like the touch ID scanner we've gotten to know on recent iPhones and while the glancing stalks might lend credence that analysis a firmer press reveals the truth Apple swapped out the physical clicky home button of years past with an all-new unmoving solid state button that's right no more clicks instead the button uses 3d touch pressure sensitivity to analyze a differences between a tap and a proper press and respond accordingly that includes using the phone's revamped taptic engine to give users an emulated clicky response it doesn't feel just like the old button but use it for a few days and that difference quickly becomes inconsequential one of the biggest upgrades of this year's iPhone is another you can't see it all as Apple take steps to protect the phone's hardware from dust and water ingress that's right we've finally got an iPhone with an official rating for water resistance the phone's ip67 designation isn't quite as robust as the ip68 we see on the models like Samsung's flagship s-- meaning the iPhone 7 can't go quite as deep underwater but still a great start for Apple just be careful about not pushing things too far if something does happen when you're getting your iPhone wet apples not going to cover water damage under the phone's warranty buyer beware finally there's one particularly glaring change that comes to the iPhone sevens exterior makeup as the phone's bottom edge loses its analogue headphone jack the port's not been relocated either it's gone for good instead the phone ships with a new version of Apple's ear pods that attacks via lightning connector as well as a lightning to headphone jack adapter that allows you to continue using your existing lunkhead sets apples not the first company to take such an action with one of its smartphones but the iPhone 7 is easily the most high-profile device to attempt this move say what you will about the reasoning behind it but it's bold forward-thinking and if there's any smartphone manufacturer that can convince its users to willingly and maybe even happily give up their stalwart headphone jacks well it's Apple as we'd only hope the new ear pods sound quite nice if you like the existing analog version you won't find any surprises here but really we're interested in what happens next will we see more and more headphone makers start delivering lightning powered models or will Apple's move instead drive new segments of users to the world of wireless headphones and what's a minor footnote to the story of the vanishing headphone jack the speaker grille you see apple's place where the jack once lived is apparently for aesthetic purposes only it doesn't actually emit any sound while that grille might not the other one on the bottom edge very much does and this year it's joined by a secondary speaker in the phone's earpiece for apple's first attempt at an iPhone with stereo speakers the effect isn't perfect largely because the two speakers don't have matching output with the bottom edge opponent cranking out far more bass than the earpiece but it's a nice addition all the same and the combination of all that output makes the iPhone 7 easily the loudest iPhone we've ever tested with the same exterior dimensions as the iPhone 6s it shouldn't be a shock to learn that Apple's keeping the iPhone 7s display geometry unchanged giving us another 4.7 inch LCD panel with the resolution of 750 by 1334 that's fine by us though at this size it really doesn't need to be any higher res instead the improvements Apple delivers are in terms of brightness and color gamut our tests support apples claims of a new max brightness of around 625 nits helping the screen visibility in bright daylight and support for a wider color gamut means that images should pick up new lifelike details it's a little difficult to appreciate on its own but it's a move in a positive direction for Apple all the same the iPhone 7 arrives running iOS 10 for the same interface improvements and retooled apps we've already had the chance to check out when upgrading our older Apple hardware Apple's added a bunch of new 3d touch interactions to its system and we've got to say this is starting to feel more and more legitimately useful and less like the gimmick it had the risk of becoming messages gets a big overhaul with stickers text in emoji galore and new versions of maps photos music and news help keep Apple software looking and feeling fresh lift to wake support is a great way to check your notifications without needing to fully unlock your phone and that's made all the more powerful by some useful lock screen widgets there's a lot going on with iOS 10 but it all comes together to give us one of the Apple's best executed system updates to date pack with usability boosting new enhancements while not taking away any beloved functionality all the software runs on Apple's new a10 fusion chip a new a series processor well that were used to in a new iPhone but this fusion branding should clue you in that this year's upgrade is particularly snazzy the quad core chip is powerful when it needs to be and able to sip at the phone's battery when it can in an effort to keep power consumption down benchmark testing backs up Apple's claims speed boosts and we can't deny the performance was smooth and relatively stutter free all across the phone software Apple pairs the a-10 with two gigs of RAM just like we got last year and while ram capacity isn't growing though the seven-plus is another story we do get one welcome upgrade in terms of flash storage as Apple drops at 16 gig base level in favor of 32 gigabytes for the iPhone 7 an extra $100 upgrades that to 128 gigabytes and another hundred above that buys you the ticket to the 256 gig Club that's still on the pricey side especially compared to microSD cards but we're happy to at least see Apple acknowledging the demand for more and more local storage like we're used to call sounds pretty good on the iPhone 7 both in regular and speakerphone modes we had a few connectivity bumps here and there but the biggest issues seem to be with carrier networks themselves rather than any problem with the iPhones hardware or software LTE support gets a slight upgrade with support for a new higher speed networks if your carrier happens to have the right tech installed what about the camera the iPhone 7 plus gets all the headlines with its dual camera system but the iPhone 7 single main camera enjoy some important upgrades of its own we've got another 12 megapixel sensor here but one with a wider F 1.8 aperture that brings in more light than we got with the iPhone 6s Apple also implements optical stabilization previously a plus only feature between the two of those enhancements it's easier than ever to snap some really are well exposed pics even in less than ideal lighting situations and if you do happen to need a little extra light an upgraded quad LED flash is ready to help out just like the expanded color gamut of the iPhone 7s display the phone's camera gets a similar upgrade to capture a wider field of colors that same extra range comes to the phone's front face er as well which also gets a resolution bunk to 7 megapixels that means the FaceTime HD camera now supports full 1080p video capture video recording doesn't get much in the way of specific upgrades after all we already had 4k but it does enjoy the benefits of these general camera improvements including the shot steadying performance of the cameras optical stabilization considering how nice pics and video looked in the iPhone 6s we had high hopes for the iPhone 7s camera performance and it really doesn't disappoint the wider color gamut can be a little too subtle to appreciate in many conditions but the stabilization is a really nice addition to the phone's hardware in short we're big fan of Apple's upgrades here all this hardware needs to get its power from somewhere an apple blesses the iPhone 7 with a larger battery than last year or even the year before 1960 milliamp hours combined with power optimizing components like that a10 fusion processor that gives the iPhone 7 some impressive battery life gaining well over an hour of screen on time compared to the iPhone 6s in our custom test battery there's still room for improvement here and we'd love to see Apple try something like wireless charging but this progress towards all-day battery life is still really great to see looking over the iPhone sevens feature set it's almost like Apple stumbled across our secret wish list of Most Wanted iPhone upgrades waterproofing check optically stabilized low light friendly camera you got it longer than ever battery life not a problem that's not to say that every move here is a win and we're still smarting from the loss of the headphone jack but you know what we'll get over it so much else here is done so well it even diehard Android fans this guy included are likely to come away impressed by what Apple's managed to do here the iPhone 7 isn't the flashiest iPhone ever but what it lacks in crazy new tech enix up forward really well done thoughtfully executed upgrades Apple's done so much well here that this easily comes across as one of the most desirable smart phones to land so our this year I'm Steven shank with
