appllo is never really in a rush when redesigning products but the 20/20 iPhone models may shake things up in an unexpected way hi guys this is Victor with phone arena and today we're taking a look at the latest iPhone 12 rumors including some very interesting renders made in-house the 20/20 iPhones are expected to come equipped with 5g blistering fast 121st displays a fourth camera on at least one of the models and yes a new design that's actually rumored to borrow from two of Apple's most iconic iPhone models according to the latest rumors the iPhone 12 will ditch the current smooth and bulbous design in favor of a sharper boxier aesthetic reminiscent of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 we wouldn't be all that surprised really considering that Apple's iPad pro lineup already looks like that and the MacBook Pro seems to be moving in this direction as well with much flatter edges than before the iPhone 11 and 11 pro marked the 3rd year since Apple introduced the notch on the iPhone 10 so many people are hoping that the current generation of iPhones will also be the last feature the polarizing remnant of a tough bezel we wouldn't get our hopes up too much though because the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 pro are almost certainly going to have faced ID and though there have been dubious rumors that Apple might try to miniaturize all the sensors and front-facing cameras so that they fit in a regular bezel we would much rather wager on a smaller notch and a slightly thinner bezels around the display but let's also talk about the camera because we've got some interesting stuff to share about that as well after introducing a triple camera setup on the iPhone 11 Pro Series which consists of wide ultra wide and telephoto cameras Apple is rumored to be including an additional fourth one on the 20/20 iPhone models you won't be able to take actual pictures with it because it will be a time of flight camera which is solely dedicated to measuring depth but it's bound to find some interesting applications either way apples homegrown augmented reality platform a arkad is definitely an area where the time-of-flight camera can be used to great effect but it could also help improve the existing photo portrait mode or even make video portrait mode possible if the hardware of the new iPhones allows it the 20/20 models are also set to come prepared for 5g connectivity although some analysts claim that we won't see 5g on an Apple iPhone until 2021 either way 5g still has a long way to go before it becomes properly reliable and wide reaching but ever may be wise to future-proof the iPhone 12 just in case one of the hottest trends in the Android world right now is also said to be making its way to the next iPhones we're talking about high refresh rate screens of course Apple already has a 120 Hertz display in the iPad pro so we wouldn't be too surprised to see a 90 Hertz or even a 120 Hertz screen on the iPhone 12 why do you need one of those well simply put a display with a high refresh rate can make everything on the phone run and look smoother from your social media feeds to games to the user interface itself besides it's all the rage right now but that's all we have to share for the iPhone 12 at the moment what do you think about that Bulls upcoming next iPhone would you be buying one let us know in the comments my name is Vic this is fall arena it's my pleasure talking to you now see you in the next one you
