[Music] my name is Konstantin khalaf but you can find me as the psycho sheep around the internet my experience with artwork started as the moment I could basically hold a pencil or pen whatever but I started taking it more seriously around my high school years where I started developing a style I do mostly freelance work and I try to do my artwork into merchandise I can sail around you know art bazaars and art shows right now I'm working on a indie game for mobile what makes me love no drawing as a whole is that my head is always full of ideas and I can just pick up paper and lay it immediately on that paper and develop it as a concept so I basically enjoyed it the fact that you can just simply express yourself in almost unlimited ways and that's why I enjoy drawing I get inspired by people's lives and their stories that they tell me around and I can kind of convert those the situation's the feelings into you know more abstract scenery or a character that's also something I really enjoy the things I most like to draw are either very surreal almost abstract kind of you know situations and characters or just characters in general the first character is a lone Viking probably the last one and a very epic battle let's call him Ralph Ralph is very angry and out for blood since his brothers and sisters have fallen as for the other character I like to call him diagonal Joe and he doesn't have much of a story except that he's confused in the world where everyone has a normal straight face and he just has a very geometric or shaped face I don't know what just made it up on the fly [Music] okay here's the thing I'm more of a traditional kind of guy I prefer my paper and my inks but I cannot denying all the flexibility of working digitally so what I do is like I scan a lot of my traditional works on the computer and then I use the Adobe catalog to call my work specifically Photoshop Illustrator and when I am drawing digitally I have a Wacom tablet specifically a interest Pro Wakeham so far has been in the most you know flexible and useful to me I had no trouble with the s-pen it's been it's very flexible there's no lag lag but and the burst strokes are pretty pretty accurate but maybe it's a little bit in a way more sensitive but I think that's not an issue I enjoy working with the s-pen as well as you know we're coming at that with them definitely a lot of fun I had a lot of fun with the s-pen [Music]
