hello everyone Vick here with fall arena and I have with me the two $1,100 flagships of Apple and Samsung this is the iPhone 11 Pro max in the Galaxy Note Templar these are arguably the best smartphone the two companies offer and today we'll do a quick comparison between their most important specs and features as always we started the design the note M plus is a big step forward in terms of looks the bezels around the display are almost entirely gone thanks to this tiny hold it houses the front facing camera compared to last year's note 9 the note 10 looks sleek and modern that feeling is enhanced by the knob hence thinner body which makes it more comfortable to hold and less bulky when you put a case on it on the back there's now a vertical camera array housing the three main cameras in a tiny time-of-flight sensor next to it to complete the fancy aesthetic there is a new Aurora glow finish that changes colors based depending on the light in camp Apple the design changes are minimal on the front the iPhone 11 Pro max looks just like the iPhone 10's max big notch at the top third year in a row without turning it around however things start to differ first unlike the note the iPhone has gained some weight and it shows he's the added book worth it however keep watching to find out on the back we see the biggest change coming to this year's iPhones the new camera bump with three smaller bumps on top of it look at you like a surprise insect some love the new look others hated for us it's an acquired taste but we'll get to the cameras and what they can do in a bit first let's go through a rundown of the hardware specs of the two phones for this place we have a six point eight inch one on the note 10 plus versus a 6.5 inch one on the 11pro max both all add both high resolution with the null having a slight edge over the iPhone with its quality resolution but my default is set to full HD where Apple has an edge however is screen brightness this year's Pro iPhones have new displays that can top around 800 nits of brightness and can hit 1200 miss for parts of the display when enjoying HDR content despite these slight differences both displays look gorgeous and they're considered some of the best of the market and for a good reason what's driving these displays from the inside is also quite impressive Apple's a 13 Bionic chip is crushing it when it comes to performance but the snapshot an 8 5 5 within the note 10 plus is no slouch either top performance coming from both sides of the Ring as expected the iPhone receives a serious blow in one category in Telus storage the iPhone 11 pro max comes with only 64 gigabytes of base storage it's just not OK for a flagship phone in 2019 especially one costing that much the no 10 plus on the other hand comes with 256 gigs and a slot for expandable storage on top of that to finish off the specs list and avoid the rage of tech nerds we have to mention that the note also has three times more RAM than the iPhone now specs are one thing but how does it feel to use these phones in the day-to-day well the iPhone feels like any other iPhone really throws the same iOS 13 any other iPhone released in the last four years us of course with the 11pro max there are no signs of lag or any hiccups even when using more demanding apps but ultimately there is nothing exciting or different about it this is where the note 10 plus says hold my beer hand pulls out if I spend the s-pen is more than just your regular stylist let's just scribble a quick note on the display use it as a camera trigger or even change camera modes granted it's not a vital feature by enemies but if you're the type of person that would make use of it every day there's really nothing that can replace it it's what gives the Galaxy Note its name and has plenty of loyal fans that would hate to see it gone trust me on that one apart from the unique software features that come with the s-pen Samsung's 1ui is built at productivity in mind we can separate apps and pop-up windows and arrange them any way you want if you're not dead productive just have the screen split in half so you can listen to a YouTube video while texting can you do that on the iPhone nope but how long can you enjoy these pinnacles of smartphone technology before having to ground them for a recharge well this is where the iPhones expanded guts come into play despite still having a smaller battery than the note the iPhone manages to squeeze out of it about an hour more useful screen on time according to our new battery test which you can check in the description below this means the iPhone 11 pro max the new benchmark for flagship battery life and competitors will have a hard time beating it now it's time to take a look at the camera performance a category every flagship wants to dominate but only if you succeed harder wise the two phones have a similar toolkit at their disposal main camera telephoto camera ultra wide-angle camera and of course a selfie camera at the front so let's look at a few camera samples daytime shooting is a breeze for both phones and differences come down to the approach of each camera the no tops for more striking visuals with increased color saturation and sharper edges while the iPhone sticks to a more realistic representation that some might find a little bit bland things get interesting when the Sun gets involved with its extreme brightness coming from weird angles or in other words when HDR comes into play the iPhone consistently handles both the brightest areas of the pictures and the shadowy parts better than the knob 10 the same can't be said when it comes to selfies however the Samsung flagship is doing a better job at HDR while in normal conditions the two phones achieve similar results at night the two devices take on different paths once more then no ten plus takes longer exposures which results in brighter images but if your hand isn't very steady here might be some smudged elements meanwhile the iPhone sacrifices some light in favour of sharpness and quicker shots still both holes do an admirable job when it comes to low-light photography something that can be said for older iPhones we can spend our sniff picking follows and other details about these two phones but we covered the most important aspects and that's enough for now more
