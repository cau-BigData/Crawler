just yesterday we were the first on the Internet to give you a look at the Android 10 update for the Samsung Galaxy S time series and today we'll dive into a little more detail hello there Rick with phoner in here and yesterday many of you asked us whether this is a beta that we are running the answer is no it's not and we can prove this by going into the Samsung members application where you can see that our phone is not registered for the beta program with this in mind let's explore the biggest new feature that comes with the Android 10 update on the Galaxy S 10 plus the new animations for years we have pointed out that Samsung phones don't appear quite as smooth as other phones and the reason for that was because they lacked those transitional animations Android 10 now finally fixes that and to see the difference that will open and close a few applications on the just updated Galaxy S 10 plus on one side in the galaxy note 10.1 zhan the older Android 9 version on the other side notice how the note jumps from the app to the home screen with no transition it looks a bit jittery well with this new update you have the animation that makes for a much smoother experience on the galaxy s 10 plus these animations show up with both the new gesture navigation interface as well as with the standard three button Android navigation speaking of gestures we have a brand new gesture navigation here and here's how you use it you can swipe from either the left or the right side of the screen to go back one step to go home you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the recent cards you swipe up from the bottom and hold it for a second and finally to open the Google assistant you swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right parts of the screen and this will work even when you have an app open but will not work from the lockscreen one feature I'm really happy is now available Samsung phones is screen recording go into settings and advanced features and select the new screenshots and screen recorder menu and you can set your phone to record your screen and different resolutions plus you can also record your screen and yourself with the front camera and microphone something especially useful for those who record their game or tutorials another lovely new feature is a change to the wallpapers menu that now looks much cleaner is now it's easier to pick a wallpaper for just the lockscreen or the home screen night mode that would turn the background to black is now known as dark mode on Android 10 and what's really cool is that now wallpapers didn't ever-so-slightly when you turn on dark mode so they are easier on the eyes we also love the new smart reply option for notifications when you receive a message you now have a couple of precomposed replies plus you can easily open links that someone sends you right from the notification drop-down and if someone sends you an address the system will automatically show you a link so you can open it directly in Google Maps super useful switching over to the camera we've already mentioned the new look of the interface but you should also know about a few new features first you can now use night mode for selfies you need to manually enable night mode first and then shoot a picture which will take a few extra moments but it's worth it because it will turn out brighter and better looking at night the other new feature is a our doodle which was available first on the note 10 series and now comes to the Galaxy S 10 as well while these features might not be groundbreaking they are really nice improvements to the Galaxy S 10 series that make an already great phone work even better we have not noticed any change in battery life so far either a big question remains when will everyone get this update and unfortunately we don't know the answer yet so far it seems that the rollout is limited to just a few countries do you have any questions about Android 10 on the galaxy s 10 plus don't hesitate to drop them in the comments below and we'll do our best to answer thanks for watching this don't forget to hit that like button subscribe to see more of our videos my name is Vic and I'll talk to you next time right here on fawn arena
