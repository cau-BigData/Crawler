these are two of my favorite phones of the year the Google pixel for Excel and the iPhone 11 Pro max but what are the differences and which one should you go for hello Internet Viki oh it for Narita and I have been using the pixel for excel in the last few days and I'm impressed how much fun this phone is first things first though let's compare the design of these two both use glass with a soft matte finish on the back choose very nice to touch plus this finish keeps fingerprint smudges away the stainless steel side on the iPhone feels a bit more premium and it's also a slightly heavier phone of the tool while the pixel feels a bit more airy but in terms of actual size they're about the same the physical buttons are on the side but we noticed that the large power button on the iPhone is easier to find this one little convenience that you appreciate you also have the mute switch on the iPhone which you don't get on the pixel both are ip68 water protected so they will survive a few drops of rain or if you spill a liquid on them which is a great thing on the bottom you have the universal USB C port for charging on the pixel while the iPhone still goes with a lightning connector and this release just annoying USB C is everywhere and it's a pain that Apple sticks with its own proprietary connector lightning cables are more expensive and the ones that Apple makes break easily speaking of annoyances there is no headphone jack on either one and you need a dongle for Wired headphones in my opinion the one feature that makes flagships these days stand out from cheaper phones is display quality and these two aren't absolute joy both have all that screens and both look incredible pixels used to have subpar screens just a couple of years ago but the pixel for excel really has an amazing screen with very nice color balance and excellent viewing angles the pixel also looks a bit sharper thanks to its higher resolution but which one is faster in daily use Peppo has always been the gold standard for smooth performance but I've used it this year the pixel feels like the faster phone this is mostly because gestures finally work well on the pixel but also because the screen reverses 90 times per second well the iPhone one refreshes 60 times per second everything seems to move smoother and faster than before in the pixel well the iPhone feels smooth but slower the pixel is also a joy to use because it gets the small things right take the live wallpapers for example they are extremely well made even that Pikachu one is a ton of fun and the Apple ones feel a bit boring honestly however when it comes to functionality iOS has a few features that are missing on the pixel there is no native screen recorder for example an extremely useful feature if you want to record just a part of a video and you have it on the iPhone then dark-themed is available in the pixel but instead of automatically turning on at night you have to enable it manually every single time which is just stupid we won't go into the whole Android versus iOS thing I bet you're well aware of the limitations of the closed file system in iOS the big problem with pixel for me is face unlock it is extremely fast yes but it is completely unsecure it will unlock your phone even when you have your eyes closed which is just absurd I can be sleeping and someone can just point the phone at me and to unlock Google has promised an updated that will fix it but it's just an absurd situation right now face ID on the iPhone on the other hand requires you to attentively look at it to unlock it and it is the proper safe way to do face recognition so what about the cameras this is a topic for a separate video but put shortly the iPhone has a bit more versatility with user White's camera and it beats the pixel for video while the Google phone does better with dynamic range in wins it when shooting in low-light the iPhone insists on taking pictures with a yellow tint to them well the pixel has a way more natural white balance take a look at a few photos yourself next up battery life the iPhone has a slightly bigger battery and it also lasts longer for browsing and social media the iPhone lasts around thirteen hours while the pixel goes for just nine hours and a half a big difference and for YouTube video streaming the iPhone lasts nearly nine hours while the pixel only goes for seven hours and 17 minutes surprisingly for 3d gaming in games like fortnight and minecraft the iPhone actually dies faster it lasts 5 hours and 15 minutes on average compared to open eight hours in 20 minutes on the pixel yes both support fast charging and both also have wireless charging onboard and while many have complained about the big notch on the iPhone the bezel on the pixel for Excel is even bigger and the reason for that is that it now features a new motion sense technology featuring radars for the first time on the phone but to tell you the truth I've used this for a while and I disabled it after an hour and 2 and the reason for that is if you use an app like Spotify in the background and if you just wave your hand around the phone without intentionally trying to skip the song it was sometimes still skip it and it's just annoying motion cells still doesn't seem to work perfectly well but finally let's talk prices the pixel with a starting price of $900 is $100 cheaper than the iPhone but we would say that if you can wait it out don't buy it right now previous pixel phones have quickly seen their prices cut by a couple of hundred dollars and we expect the same thing this year so yes the pixel is the better deal in to be an even better deal in a few months summing it all up the pixel feels like the fastest and most enjoyable Android phone out there for the year and also the one with the best camera the Eifel however beats it in terms of battery life video recording quality in this stronger iOS ecosystem with the Apple watch air pots and so on and this wraps
