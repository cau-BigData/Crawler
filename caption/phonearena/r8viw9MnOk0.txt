hey guys call me pres and this is the new iPad pro for 2020 yeah it does kind of look like an iPad pro from 2018 ah if you don't come the little stock design here and if you haven't seen the new iPad pros since two years ago first of all really and secondly yes it does kind of look like a prototype that made it to the production line but the design has grown on me it's very light very thin very comfy carry around and just do your work well on the go and I can kind of see where Apple was going with this especially since they announced the new magic keyboard which is not out yet these are starting to look like sort of MacBook Pros but not really so what's the only inside well of course there's a new processor is the Apple a 12 Z what does that mean I don't know all I know is that the 2018 edition had the Apple a 12 X inside so this is a Z all I know is that we're running out of out of that but it is interesting to note that the iPhone 11 has the Apple 813 so technically this iPad pro does not have the latest generation family of apple chips either that or Apple poached the guys from Sony who are thinking of the experience but now don't worry about performance this thing flies especially with the 120 Hertz screen which has been a staple of the iPad pro line for the past few years if you haven't seen I I mean iPad OS run on 121st screen so far it's so much smoother is just awesome to use now let's talk about this thing so yep we have a triple camera but the third thing it's a lighter sensor hey what okay okay I know that dozens of youtubers have explained to you what a lighter does but look I went out and I got myself an old Sony camera so I can get footage of the lasers in this thing so we're talking about it basically lighter shoots out a bunch of lasers that measures how much time each one of them takes to come back and this way it can determine what kind of objects there have been in the environment how close they are to you how big there are their edges distances measurements so on so forth what do we want to use it for augmented reality Apple has said that AR is the future I'm not sure I can see it yet but that's where we're going so yeah of course we tested it unfortunately all of the apps that we found in the App Store using air have not been optimised to use the lighter yet so yeah they work but you won't see much difference between this and the other iPads or the iPhones so technically the lighter should be able to spot real-world objects coming in and out of you so the virtual objects from your AR should be able to interact with them in some way either hide behind them or ignore them or move and we haven't seen this yet but the baked in measure app that does come with the iPad pro is better so first of all as soon as you launch it you don't need to wave your device around until it figures out what it's looking for the lighter is instant you launch the measure app you're ready to measure the surface in front of you it's definitely more accurate than previous iPads for the iPhones still not perfectly accurate but it does get a good job done it mostly struggles with remembering where the virtual points you placed are so when you turn around and you turn back to where you started from the point is slightly off which throws off your measurement by an inch maybe basically the longer the distance is you're measuring you still get a higher chance of a mistake but we found out that for short distances it's pretty spot-on oh yes we also get two cameras on the side that we have the irregular wide-angle and an ultra wide-angle camera the wide-angle one is a 12 megapixel shooter it performs pretty much like the iPhone 11 it's probably the same camera same awesome color reproduction great details fantastic HDR the ultra web camera has been slightly downgraded it's 10 megapixels here whereas on the 11 it's 12 megapixels so with the iPad pro we get softer details on the ultra wide-angle pictures some more noise especially if you move indoors I mean it's usable it's good but not as good as on the iPhone now even have noticed that I'm kind of zooming as the camera part here there's good reason for that who cares hip-hop's cameras on a tablet I mean who walks around shooting pictures with this thing yeah I know I did I did I was walking around the city taking samples for this review people were looking at me but I mean otherwise there is one camera on a tablet that does matter and that's the front-facing camera cuz you know you'll be using this for business calls Skype calls FaceTime with your friends so it would have been really nice to get the same high quality selfie camera from the iPhones here but no this is a seven megapixel shooter it's not terrible it's not bad but it's not as good as on the iPhone I was kind of hoping that the lighter would be used for a portrait mode on the main camera with the iPad but no portrait mode on the iPad still only uses the front-facing camera utilizing the face ID sensors onto the big news no iPad iOS 13.4 finally supports it bluetooth mouse now of course you can just have a simple pointer on the iPad because Apple has to do Apple things and you get this circular pointer that kind of changes shape every time you go in and out of items and different items on your screen so it looks like a cartoon metal character I'm not sure why it still just works like a regular pointer and it's available on all iPads that support the u.s. hybrid OS this in combination with split screen and the slide over mode really make this a multitasking machine well sort of it's it's not PC great multitasking but it's nice to see it which brings me to the obvious question can the iPad pro replace your computer ya know maybe crap well it depends who really depends what you're gonna do with it I mean I love walking around with this thing as I said earlier taking calls checking emails chatting with my colleagues maybe even writing a small article or even the notes for this review I wrote them on the iPad now now I'm cheating by reading them from yeah I also absolutely enjoy using iPads for music I've been doing it for years it's super fun it's portable it's powerful there are so many apps it's it's just amazing but if I have to sit down and write a meteor bigger article if I need to do my research open hundreds of tabs in my browser edit images down to the pixel I'm not going to use an iPad I am going to use a computer of some sort maybe even a MacBook so it really depends on what you're going to do with it like if you're an artist you're gonna love the Apple pencil if you're in a sort of musician you will enjoy the portable power you get with this but you have a computer I definitely see it replacing the computer for some users but it still has some way to go and now you're probably asking yourself is it actually worth getting an iPad pro for eight hundred dollars when I can get the base iPad for three thirty or the iPad air for five hundred dollars both of which support iPad or West 13.4 and have Mouse support they have their own keyboard accessory they even support the first generation Apple pencil in my opinion this is absolutely worth it as an iPad fan but also if this was the 2018 iPad pro I wouldn't have been so sure the 2018 model has a starting storage of 64 gigabytes which kind of pushed you to upgrade I mean if you're getting an iPad pro it's minutes you're kinda serious about your tablet usage now this one this one starts at 128 gigs which is definitely not bad it could take a while to fill those up on a tablet the iPad pro also has the USB type-c port which allows you to connect it to Tom accessories out there like external hard drives even or this old Sony camcorder which I used to record the lighter lasers and then I downloaded the footage from this to this magic that combined with the quad speakers in stereo setup indeed awesome 124 display I love it I would go out and buy this one if you're just dipping your toes into iPad territory right now and if you are wondering if it's for you get the base model the cheapest one and and if you like it for going down the line you can get accessories for it like a keyboard and pencil but if you're out there looking for an iPad that's you know serious and you're wondering whether you should get the iPad air for the iPad pro hands down get this one I love it I absolutely adore it hey you like the home set up well subscribe to for every line you may see more of it [Music]
