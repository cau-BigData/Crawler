how long does it take to charge up the s20 ultra and how it's charging speeds compared to the fastest chargers offered another flagship phones like iPhones pixels and oneplus devices hello guys my name is Vic would phone arena and today I have seven of the most popular top-tier phones in 2020 and I have drained their batteries completely all of them are ready for charging speed race I have prepared the charges that come in the box with each of the phones now there's the same 25 watt fast charger for the s20 ultra and no 10 plus you have an 18 watt charger for the s10 plus an 18 watt charger for the iPhone and the pixel in a 30 watt charger for the oneplus and finally the shameful 5 watt super slow charger for the iPhone 11 we can see more battery specs on your screens and it's time to kick this thing off flip the charging switch and the phone start charging all at the same time on the side you see a timer for your convenience as well and five minutes after the beginning of the test it's time to do our first check starting with the new S 20 ultra it already has 29% on the battery meter quite a good start the galaxy s 10 plus next to it already has a 20% charge the no 10 plus has 32 percent on the battery meter next up the iPhone 11 Pro max has charged up to 22% the iPhone 11 which uses the incredibly slow fire watt charger only has 11% finally the pixel for Excel has 24% charged up and the oneplus 70 it actually leads the way with 37% what oneplus does with swarf charge technology is truly impressive but let's move a little forward and do our next check 30 minutes after the beginning of this charging test the galaxy s 20 ultra keeps on charging at a nice fast pace and already has 59% battery level the s10 plus is noticeably slower and has just 40 percent charge now I see note 10 + which uses the same charger as the ultra but has a smaller battery pulls ahead and has a 64 percent charge level the apples are a bit slower the pro max has charged up to 46 percent and the iPhone 11 is though only 20% the Google made pixel for Excel has a 40% charge and finally the oneplus 70 again impresses as its battery has already charged up to 74 percent in just half an hour the rest definitely could take a lesson from oneplus and our next check happens in 45 minutes after the beginning of this test the s20 ultra now has 86 percent on the battery meter the S 10 plus has 59 percent the note 10 plus has 87 percent and at this point the ultra and the note have almost equalled out the iPhone 11 Pro max has 68 percent battery charge while the regular iPhone 11 only has 29 percent battery charge it is just sad next the pixel has 68 percent meaning that it charges just as fast as the iPhone pro max finally the oneplus 70 is nearly finished at 94% and it is the phone to get if you want the absolute fastest charging speeds just a bit later 58 minutes after we started this test the oneplus 70 reaches a full hundred percent charge beating all the phones in this test the funny thing is that all of the phones here are way more expensive than this $600 powerhouse coming from China it's a great value for money offer and we do our next check at one hour into the test and the s20 ultra now has 98% charge the s10 plus has 78 percent charge the note M plus stands at 95 percent as it seems to have slowed down towards the end the pro max has 81 percent charge o the regular iPhone 11 only has 38 percent on the battery meter and the Google pixel runs alongside the iPhone pro max at an 82 percent charge level in just a few minutes after this check the galaxy s 20 ultra finish is charging and it's done in one hour and four minutes oh it's not quite as fast as the oneplus keep in mind that it has a much larger five thousand milliamp hour battery on the inside too it's also interesting that Samsung seems to have done some optimizations for charging here because the s20 ultra actually charged faster than the note 10 plus and both phones have the same Chargers but the ultra has the larger battery speaking of the note it reaches a 400% charge in one hour and six minutes a great result - we still have four phones left to run and all of them take their time we do a routine check at the one hour and fifteen minutes mark and you can see the scores the sn+ has 90% the iPhone 11 pro max also has 90% the regular iPhone 11 has just 46% and the Google pixel for excel is a bit ahead at 92% let's keep this test going next up we do a check at one hour and a half and these phones still haven't finished charging you have 96% on the s10 plus the iPhone 11 Pro max also has 96 percent deaf 11 is just 55% on the battery meter finally the pixel has 97 percent these last percentage points are the slowest to charge but wait for a few more minutes and the sm+ reaches a full charge in one hour and 42 minutes the Google pixel is neck-and-neck with the iPhone but the pixel finishes the best faster with a full charge in one hour and 48 minutes the iPhone 11 Pro max gets to a 100% battery charge just three minutes later in one hour and 51 minutes with all of this the only phone left charging is the regular iPhone 11 with its super slow 5 watt charger it really is an embarrassment for Apple to ship such a slow charger in 2020 we for once won't have you sitting around waiting for hours for this one phone to finish charging so just give you the final score the iPhone level takes a painfully long three hours and 33 minutes to finish charging yikes we should also mention that the iPhone 11 does support fast charging speeds but only if you purchase a compatible adapter which is sold separately it just boggles the mind that you have to spend about 30 dollars on a fast charger and then $20 on a cable just to use fast charging on the iPhone 11 anyway here's once again the list of the phones in this comparison in the time it took them to reach a full hundred percent charge using nothing but there is included with the phones the galaxy s 20 ultra did surprisingly well Samsung has optimized a 25 watt charger so it's a bit faster than the same charger on the note 10 plus and both these phones charge much faster than last year's s-pen series which is a nice improvement of course we'll also be showing you our detailed battery drain test of the s20 ultra and other phones so stay tuned for that and also don't forget to visit us on the web at www.ctvn.org the future thanks for being with us stay well and I will see you in the next one
