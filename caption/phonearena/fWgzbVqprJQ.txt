I have been using the Samsung Galaxy Note m+ intensely in the last week or so and we have run all sorts of tests here at honoring that and it's time for our full review hello guys my name is liquid phone arena and the Samsung Galaxy Note m+ is Samsung's latest flagship its latest and greatest and compared to its Samsung Galaxy Note mind first look doesn't look all that much different the phones have a similar physical size but once you actually get to hold them and to use them you start noticing the differences where's the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 feels a bit heavier both carry always felt like a hefty device not very comfortable to use while the Galaxy Note templates is actually very lightweight it has subtle subtle curves on its back that makes it feel more ergonomic it's a way more pocketable it feels easier to hold and to handle now the other big change here is that the headphone jack is gone and the headphone jack has been one of the staples the signature features of Samsung phones in the past few years but for the first time it's gone here on the flagship phone and is it important it's something that I will personally miss and many power users who also miss because of the convenience not always you have the ability to use wireless headsets not everyone has them not always are they charged up so this is one little inconvenience this is a deal-breaker in 2019 probably not but it's something to keep in mind now the other thing about the note 10 plus is that it feels more symmetrical if you remember in the past Samsung phones had a little bit of this symmetry the USBC port was a little bit off-center now all of that is fixed everything is very symmetrical even that punch hole right here in the camera is right in the center everything looks very nicely balanced on the side of the phone you have an aluminum frame some people who say it's a stainless steel with Samsung actually confirmed that it's aluminum on the back you have a glass back and on the front you also have a ruggedized glass and another interesting thing is that all the buttons on the Galaxy Note m+ are moved to the left side which is a bit weird at first you do get used to it but it tends to stay a bit weird I tend to reach as a right-handed person I tend to reach on the right-hand side it's a little bit more convenient for me I did get used to it but it's not perfectly convenient now the other thing about the note m+ is of course the S Pen and the S Pen has been improved here and the first and foremost thing about it is that it's now a unibody design use much more solid there is no wobbling parts or anything in it feels very solid very well built there's a new battery inside it that lasts up to 10 hours and when you fit it back inside the note 10 plus it automatically starts charging up so no worries about battery life of course you have convenient features like the lockscreen memo so you can just start writing the write on the lockscreen and what's better with the new S Pen is that it now supports more gestures and it can now better recognize your handwriting even if you don't have the prettiest of handwriting which let's face it many of us do so if the phone will still recognize what you've written and it can even convert this to a Microsoft Word format which is kind of convenient so let's say about the S Pen the new gestures in the camera you can switch between the front and rear cameras you can take pictures as before it's convenient Samsung keeps on building up the features of the S Pen making it a little bit better so that's nice to have now for me personally I'm not a heavy user of the S Pen but what I do like about the Samsung phones and the note M plus in particular is the screen we have a giant 6.8 inch display here that looks absolutely gorgeous it's an AMOLED screen it has excellent viewing angles excellent brightness so you can easily see the the screen outdoors even under bright light it has nice colors you can switch between two modes now so you don't have that much variance in terms of options previously used to have four different color modes now you have just the natural mode which I'm using right now and you also have a vivid color mode where colors really start to pop but don't look quite that realistic the screen really is gorgeous on this thing what it's lacking though is ninety Hertz refresh rate now this is one of the latest features that we've seen on phones like the oneplus 7 pro and it makes a difference it's not something that you notice right away but once you start using a nine first phone I find overall experience more refined and you don't might have this extra refinement here in the one and Samsung Galaxy Note templates now that you breaker again but something to keep in mind the display on the samsung galaxy note m+ comes with a quad HD resolution but by default it's set to full HD and that is enough you can't really see much of a difference I've tried switching to between quad HD and Full HD and Full HD is better for the battery life so I tend to stay at full HD the difference is really quite minimal and you really have to stare at your screen from very up close to see any real difference one thing I like about the note 10 plus and this might be a little detail but Samsung has really done a great job with the wallpapers here you have two new live wallpapers one of them is dark the other one is light so the darker is easier for your eyes at night and they look gorgeous they're very well animated and even the static wallpapers here on the home screen look absolutely beautiful now in terms of biometrics and security you do not have 3d face recognition like on iPhones and some other phones and here is that you have a 2d face picture based face recognition using the front camera it's not as secure but what is more secure is the fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen and in the same thing I was in note M plus you have an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner the technology is similar to what you have on the galaxy s 10 series it's a slightly bit improved but it's not great it's not as fast as the second gen article fingerprint scanners that we've seen on phones like the oneplus 7 pro the Wi-Fi 30 pro does really work great they do a good job and here you get a few missed attempts like a few failed failed readings it's not perfect now under the hood the Samsung Galaxy Note m+ is powered by the Snapdragon 805 5 chip or internationally the model will have an Samsung Exynos chip the Exynos 9825 both are similar in terms of performance they deliver true flagship great performance so you will not be disappointed in terms of benchmarks this phone is at the top of the rankings but in actual use is fast of course it's very fast but there are a few places where it doesn't quite feel as smooth as a Google pixel or a oneplus phone for that matter if you pull down the notification creation tray or if you're waiting for the keyboard to start it takes just a split-second more so it's not perfectly smooth but again it's very fast and one thing that's really impressive about the note 10 plus it has 256 gigabytes of on-board storage that is massive this is a that's a lot of storage and that's ufs 3.0 storage what this means is that this basically is the fastest storage you can get on the phone right now we'll show you benchmarks that show just how much faster it is compared to earlier devices but this makes a difference when you're loading games when you're loading large files and even in daily use it contributes to a more zippy performance and in terms of other options you also have a hybrid SIM card slot meaning that you can use the phone as a dual SIM phone or you can use it as a single SIM phone and you can also add a microSD card to expand the storage and get even more using a micro SD card now the defining feature of flagship phones these days must be the camera and the Samsung Galaxy Note template has an excellent camera setup you have a main camera here you also have a 2 x telephoto zoom and you have an ultra wide sensor as well which is a pretty well-rounded package now in addition to these three main cameras you also have a fourth one on the galaxy note 2 M plus and that is a depth camera it is able to measure the depth in an image so basically it comes in handy when you are measuring distances using augmented reality or for life focused portrait effects this is where it comes really handy there's an image quality it's not exactly identical to the samsung galaxy s 10 series but it's not much different these use practically the same sensors the image quality there are some differences in the colorscience but they are very very minimal what this new is actually the features now in terms of feature is the biggest new one that I tested and I tried out is called life focused video what it does is basically blurs the background leaving only you or your subject and focus or everything else is blurred kind of like the shallow depth of field effect that you get on professional cameras but personally it did not work very well in my experience now it has had a lot of artifacts and you can check out the footage to see when a person is moving it just not very accurate the other new feature here is a our doodle it allows you to jot on top of yourself or another person using the s-pen and those drawings just stick on top and it's a fun gimmick it's a gimmick but a fun one and of course you can also now control the camera using the s-pen and we guys have also shot a great cinematic movie showing you the capabilities of the galaxy note Templars camera is full range of video capabilities using 4k recordings and you can check it out right here so click on this link to take a look so if you're wondering about battery life on the Galaxy Note m+ you have a forty three hundred milli amp hour battery which is a huge size so this should mean that you get pretty good battery life and that's true but in my experience it's not quite stellar and what I mean by stellar is phones like the Huawei p3 Pro the oneplus 7 pro that have proven themselves to be excellent performance in terms of battery life the Galaxy Note template is not quite in that league now it lasts a full day sure and even a bit more if you're not using it all that much but it's not quite at the top of the rankings and you can see our benchmarks to see where exactly it stands in terms of results you also do get a new charger in the box it's a 25 watt wall charger using USB C connection and that one is actually great it allowed the Galaxy Note templates to rank among the fastest charging phones that we have ever seen charging fully from zero to hundred percent in just 65 minutes so that's really impressive and we really love this new charger on the galaxy note M plus it also supports wireless charging it also supports reverse wireless charging as well so you can place a pair of samsung wireless headphones on the back of the phone and they will charge up which is kind of neat now last but not least you have two loudspeakers on the samsung galaxy note and plus you have one at the bottom and you have another set of speakers at the top what is interesting is that they fired through those very tiny holes here at the top of the screen but you also have a third opening here at the top of the phone and that's also where sound comes from the quality of the last view is actually quite good you get a very loud sound but unlike iPhones for example that's a popular comparison iPhones get a bit more depth but this one is just louder with more definition in the higher tonality it's definitely a great loudspeaker now summing it all up what are our impressions of the Samsung Galaxy Note templates would I personally be buying one now you have to start with the price and the price on this one is quite high Samsung Galaxy Note m+ starts at $1,100 which is about the same as an iPhone 10's max it's more than most phones on the market and what's different about the note n plus this year is that it skips on some innovative new features it doesn't have a 90 Hertz refresh rate it doesn't have a super zoom camera as on the huawei phones so it's a great phone that is a bit less exciting than before so overall the Samsung Galaxy Note m+ is a phone that performs very well in all aspect it might not be the most exciting phone out there but it will certainly not disappoint we're just expecting a tiny bit more and maybe that's what we're missing so for more reviews and more interesting articles you can visit our web site at www.affordablecomm.com and thanks for watching [Music]
