the Apple earpods are some of the most popular headphones this holiday season and the past one and you can see them everywhere but how do they compare against a pair of dirt cheap copies these were bought for just $30 in Amazon and they are the eye 14 GWS hello guys my name is Vic with palm marina and we start this off by looking at the boxes you see some really strange BB fly ball it's probably the version rx quality doesn't tell me anything about the the earphones and here the original airports very nice packaging they cost around two hundred dollars so let's unbox them let's see what's inside the box and you can see that the original airports are easier to unbox and Wow okay guys so these are the high 42 WS I might forget the name of these during this video but this is the packaging that you get really cheap they sell everything that's in it this is the case that you get and we'll take a closer look just a second so what's interesting about these here i-40 three WS air pass copies is that they also use the proprietary lightning connector so we can use your standard iPhone cable to charge them up which is nice you can see that there are some problems with the alignment right here the detail is just not so good and if you lighter but also flimsier here the plastic feels very solid and on this it's kind of cheap feeling let's open these up okay that's kind of weird it's kind of strange they don't even stay in place the lid just kind of closes automatically on you when you just tell them a little bit and in comparison the original air parts stay locked very firmly very nicely see it's a bit hard to get these out Wow look at that that's probably the indication LED light here but it's all over the place you can probably see this in the close-up while the the light the lights on the airports are very delicate here on the case you can see this very delicate light she agency is just kind of ugly flashes and all sorts of disco colors it's not what you would call quality but in terms of actual size not much of a difference the copy is the I 14 TW s are maybe a little bit thicker just slightly bit bigger and in terms of actual way to these feels a little bit airy the copies don't feel quite as solid as the originals so let's try to pair them up and see what I mistook the I took the wrong case here so we have an iPhone line here and we'll use these fake ones so open these up and here there you have it my fourteen ninety four percent 100% really impressive they paired quite easily just like the original airports you have these this nice animation tells you the battery life on the air path let's hit done and try and listen to some music and this is what the fake air balls look like they feel pretty good in the year they don't fall out my ear and actually the original air paws don't fit that well in my ear and one of them twists falls out so these actually feel quite comfortable maybe just a little bit of an adjustment so I have some music playing on YouTube and the music pauses when you take one of the figure airports out and of course you can listen with just one of these fake air paws in your ears one thing that you really notice is there's no bass here they get the highs but the mids and the bass doesn't sound good so in this particular song I would say that the quality is definitely not that great and you can buy wired earphones for bit about 2030 dollars it will sound great and these just don't compare okay guys so these were the fake airports and these are the originals and right now I have the originals in my ears and what I can tell you about the fit is that they're comfortable is probably most of you have seen them but the big difference is in audio quality and these fake airports they don't have the bass and the mid well covered especially the bass he sounds very thin they don't have the definition and richness and the airport the originals while they don't sound outstanding in any particular way they do sound good and they cover both the bass and the mids and the highs in a very balanced way which is just pleasing to listen well these are just not quite that great so in terms of quality they don't really match up in terms of convenience they stay nicely in your ear they are very lightweight the case is not that well made and the lid will close automatically on you it just feels very flimsy and not well made but if you want something really cheap something to get you started in the wireless headphone revolution and want to just try these out and probably give them to someone you don't like as much these are not great guys for $30 these are an alternative we wouldn't recommend them we would recommend getting the $160 original airports or if you can get them on sale for about 130 dollars this would be a great value and that's it guys let us know what you think about these fake airports would you get a fake product let us know in the comments below that was what she thinks
