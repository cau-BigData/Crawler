instead of giving us a new iPad pro at its last event Apple refreshes cheapest tablet simply name the iPad or iPad 7 generation what's new what's old and is it worth it let's take a look the 7 gen iPad has a slight upgrade which is immediately evident when you take the device for the first time its screen is slightly bigger and this is one of two major upgrades that you should care for with this iPad instead of having a nine point seven inch display it has a 10-point two inch one the difference doesn't sound huge but it is noticeable this change will affect you differently depending on whether or not you're looking for a big screen or more compact experience with your tablet the screen itself is not laminated like on the more expensive models and it has no anti glare protection so it has this basic healthy look with the screen panel looking like it's a bit sunken inside the iPad body it's color calibration is pretty much on point though Peppa has always been great when it comes to image accuracy upon inspecting the new iPads frame we see the next major new feature a magnetic smart connector here this will allow you to connect the seven generation iPad to an apple smart keyboard and achieve that full unquote laptop replacement form factor that was previously only possible on the more expensive iPads and yes it also has support for the first gen Apple pencil but not for the newer second gen one so this thing is slowly turning into a very very affordable iPad pro of sorts one might wonder who is it any different to it's more expensive siblings well let's take a look at what hasn't changed if you take a look at the new iPad spec sheet you'll notice that it's not that new on the inside it is powered by the Apple 810 processor which was also in last year's iPad 6th gen but the chip itself is even older it was in fact the processor that powered the iPhone 7 released way back in 2016 sure it's not bad apples chips do have a lot more Headroom than others and can perform well with iOS 4 years after their release we have no complaints with the iPad 2019 its performance right now but considering it's running three years old hardware you wonder how long it will take to become obsolete also did I just say iOS sorry I meant iPad OS Apple realize that if iPads are to be productive tablets that can replace a casual users laptop they do need some quality of life improvements iPad OS is basically a branch of iOS which emphasizes on multitasking better file management and fitting more stuff on your screen and it's doing a great job at it you can have any app float over whatever you're doing right now or with most apps you can have this split screen experience the apps don't exist in their own vacuum but you can grab items from one side and paste them in the other if at any point you need to switch to doing something else you can always come back to the same split screen seen as iPad OS remembers what you've been doing of course all work and no play makes the tablet adult product iPads are most often used for multimedia consumption bringing your favorite series while doing chores around the house or while away from home here the iPad 2019 delivers a very familiar experience the screen is big enough to enjoy at an arm's length away and the speakers sound decently loud with a good amount of clarity definition and even base to them in typical cheap iPad fashion both the stereo speakers are located on one side of the tablet so technically it isn't giving you a real stereo experience but at least they sound nice there are cameras here of course there nothing impressive an 8 megapixel camera on the back and the 1.2 megapixel camera on the front basically they're there so we can have a FaceTime call or take a photo of something around you so we can quickly share it but not to capture any memorabilia in great detail and what about battery life unlike newer iPhones which airpo equips with larger batteries this new iPad has the same size battery as its predecessor at exactly 80 827 milliamp hours this is almost three times the size of a typical phone battery but this tablet is also tasked with driving a lot more pixels since many people will be buying this on for gaming for themselves or their kids battery drain for 3d gaming games like fortnight and minecraft and went from 100% to dead in a matter of both six hours and a half in comparison the iPhone 11 pro max lasts about 5 hours and 20 minutes on the same test so you're getting slightly better battery life on the tablet and that is about it there isn't much to say about the new iPad because well it's an iPad it lets you experience the full range of basic features of the iPad pro at a fraction of the price the iPad 2019 starts at three hundred and thirty dollars for the 32 gig model and really 32 gigabytes is fine for a medium machine and an internet browser but if you intend to use the tablet for some productivity or gaming you may find yourself running out of space real fast you can get the 128 gigabyte model for 430 dollars but at this point you're kind of entering the realm of the iPad air which has a better screen and a more powerful processor so is the base iPad really worth considering that's an open question and unless you are on a really tight budget or don't intend to do anything serious with it possibly otherwise we'd recommend taking a look at the iPad there or looking for a new old stock iPad pro models from previous years which may still be sold with a warranty depending on what store you get them from and this wraps up our review
