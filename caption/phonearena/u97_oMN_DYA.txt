the Sony Xperia v is a surprisingly good compact phone with top-tier specs is the smaller version of the company's flagship the Xperia one it's very comfortable to use his amazing cameras but also a few infuriating issues let's take a closer look one can say that the Sony Xperia v is the spiritual successor of the Xperia Compact series from before it has all of the flagship specs of a top-tier phone stuck in a smaller body which is much easier to hold even so it's a very tall phone so it's not as easy to interact with as the compact series of the past as you can see the Xperia v has a beautiful design Sony sticks to its signature starke rectangle as a footprint with clean looks and a very balanced feel in the hand the side-mounted fingerprint scanner is back and let me tell you we're not fans of this one not only is it inconvenient to use when the phone is on a stand or lying on a table it's also very very unreliable a little luck sometimes takes multiple attempts and often the scanner doesn't recognize our fingerprint at all the screen on the front is a beautiful wallet panel with a 6.1 inch diagonal this might sound like it's huge on paper but keep in mind that the screen ratio is 21 by 9 meaning that it's narrow and tall in reality we have little trouble handling the Xperia v with one hand it's light and very easy to shove around your palm so that you can reach every point of the screen with your thumb the display sharp and vibrant with the number of settings that you can tune to taste we found the stock calibration to be a bit too cold or dull but it was easy to set the colors up to our preference with the RGB sliders in settings when it comes to raw performance the Xperia fire does not disappoint it's equipped with a Snapdragon 805 5 and has 6 gigabytes of RAM which ensures that the phone is responsive snappy fast to load and doesn't get bogged down by any app you can find out the Play Store we did run into some software issues like random crashes of the camera or specific slowdowns when interacting with some interface elements we would hope with Sony's on top of dolls and ironing them out for a future patch and when comes to software we have the typical Sony interface onboard a very light rescan of Android with a few proprietary Sony apps this time around we did get a pre-loaded Fortnight installer and asphalt 9 which is a bit annoying but disabled them with no issues so it's not worried you wanting this unique to the Sony interface is the side sans feature you tap twice at the very edge of the display where the glass meets the metal and you get this customizable app drawer so you can quickly call up and switch between your favorite apps there's also a face unlock feature which you can fine-tune by taking multiple photos of yourself in different environments so it gets even more accurate this one really saved us from going insane over the terrible fingerprint scanner cameras is what the new exterior phones put a heavy emphasis on the Xperia v has the same camera setup this is bigger sibling the Xperia 1 and let me tell you it doesn't disappoint one bit the triple setup has a regular wide-angle camera 120 degree ultra wide camera and the two times zoom telephoto lens it was a very pleasant surprise to see that all three sensors are calibrated somewhat close to each other in color reproduction so taking pictures with the three lenses doesn't make it look like you're using three radically different cameras it's also cool that the camera support HDR video up to 4k at 60 frames per second the auto mode is pretty good at picking up scenes and setting up the camera to take a great photo as you tap the shutter unfortunately Sony's camera software is still not fleshed out and the manual mode use clunky at best aspiring filmmakers who have a lot of fun with the cinema pro app it's so nice take at the pro grade camcorder app developed specifically for film you can record 4k HDR video and 21 by 9 with different color profiles all simulating popular professional Sony cameras you've got access to all three cameras for video manual focus with programmable ad presets white balance ISO and shutter speed control the app is certainly fun to play with and while we would have liked to see focus speaking as a feature we've got no complaints here yes aspiring youtuber with the knowledge and the vision can record a short movie with this thing and achieve pretty impressive results the Xperia v comes with a 30 140 milliamp hour battery which is about the average size for a compact phone these days but what about the actual battery life for this we test rigorously using three different components first browsing we're opening a set of pages that refresh at the same pace and also scroll up and down to simulate browsing to read aloud news or use social media this test is a great indication of how long you can expect your phone to last the Xperia v scores eight hours in 30 minutes here which is a bit below the average and this is about the same score as the galaxy s 10 but lower than the iPhone 11 which scores about 11 hours on this test next up we also test YouTube video playback here the Xperia v finishes with a score of all six hours and a half this again is a bit lower than the average so if you watch a lot of YouTube videos the Sony phone will die quicker than most finally we test 3d gaming and this result will tell you how long you can expect your phone to last if you're playing games like fortnight or asphalt on it the experience scores almost 6 hours on this test which is an impressive result all in all we're really impressed with the Sony Xperia v nowadays you very rarely get to see a compact phone that has all the bells and whistles of a flagship but it also comes with a flagship price of $800 is it worth that much it's a weird question nowadays with smartphone prices going constantly up and down as manufacturers fight for every little piece of the market they can secure for themselves what we do know is that certain places will sell the Xperia v bundled with the exceptional Sony w:f 1000x and three wireless headphones which is an extra 230 value on top that's the case for you we'd say it's an amazing deal if not then the Xperia v has two main competitors for your consideration the iPhone 11 which starts at $700 and is more powerful has a great camera but is a bit on the wide side and not quite that comfortable to use with one hand and then the Samsung Galaxy S ten which has its compact size and powerful performance on the side and it runs Android but the price is a bit higher at $900 and this wraps up our review of the Xperia v a different phone in an ocean of sameness what do you think about it do you like where Sony is going with this phone
