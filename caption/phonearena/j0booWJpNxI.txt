[Music] so I just wrote arranged and recorded a full song using only the iPad pro and my guitar I know there are some pretty awesome videos out there showing you how to do this using GarageBand which is pretty cool but there are so many fun and useful apps on the App Store and I like to use many of them so I figured let's make a song with them and showcase them so before we listen to the song here's the story of how it was created first up is the app navitor whether you're an experienced musician or just learning the ropes right now now the code will help you it lets you pick a scale and instantly shows you which notes you can use as well as which codes are available to you and their relations to one another in other words it can help you out of a rut so when you're trying to finish that tricky chord progression okay so I already know that I want the song to be in the key of A but just to demonstrate Nava chords prowess I decided to go extra exotic so I picked a Hungarian now here's how this sounds you have very exotic as you can imagine it's going to be tricky to come up with a chord progression that will sound acceptable to our ears so yes I will cheat and change tonalities here and there but I will use this as a general guideline of which notes I want to be in the song once you have your mind set on a chord you can save it on this trigger pad once the pads are set up you can even go in and edit the chord voicings to get the inversions you want in there so here's our song and what's even cooler about it is that you can use navigate as a MIDI controller and sent every one of these voicings on a separate MIDI channel yeah very exotic as you can imagine it's gonna be tricky to come up with a chord progression that sounds acceptable to our ears so I'm gonna cheat I'm gonna switch tonalities go around a little bit but I am going to use the a Hungarian as my basis to always come back and what's even cooler about it is that you can use Navajo as a MIDI controller and send every one of these voicings on a separate MIDI Channel now it's time to come up with some riffs and melodies for this purpose I like to use oxy Pro it has a super simple super easy to use MIDI editor whenever I have an idea about rare for harmonics in my head I quickly just tap it away in this episode I can hear it for the purposes of this song I'm actually don't build the entire intro with oxy pro because it kind of has that sound that's in my head setting up the different loops and separate scenes is very easy and when you press export song the app exports the scenes in consecutive order now that we have our configuration figured out we have a melody it's time to move into a TW um cue basis is probably the best it's just a bit pricey if you just want to dip your toes into it there are some cheaper options that you can consider there is a beat maker 3 which is $27 and still quite good and here we have beat maker 2 which is really showing its age now but it's 12 bucks it can still help you get some kind of a job done it's an OK DW with some basic effects a convenient MIDI editor which works great on touchscreen and a lot of samples which sound well they sound kind of mad but at least they help you get your song structure right so I wrote a bass track I put a sax in there and some pads some piano to get some better sounding samples I installed SampleTank by IKEA multimedia thanks to interrupt although I can send MIDI from beat maker to SampleTank and get the sounds from SampleTank into bill maker and SampleTank has some okie sound examples its basis usable and its acts doesn't sound too bad but for piano I did go out and get my grand piano which has better samples you may have noticed I still don't have drums in there that's because I'm a bit lazy I am actually going to use GarageBand here we'd be like drummer option because it saves me so much trouble so I exported the bass MIDI file from beat maker and imported it into a new Garage Band song then I made a live drummer track and I told it to follow the bass track fiddled with the sliders and the options until I got the drum sound I wanted then i exported the drums as an actual song and imported that audio file back into beat maker now it's time to plug my audio interface in and record some guitars I do use bias effects because I believe it's one of the best guitar signal processors for iOS and iPad OS I am going to record two guitars here one thing or a 5153 one - a messy boogie it's kind of bad here is that I don't get the option to reamp my guitars later due to my setup you can kind of do it with cubasis and audio bus but it's still a bit too fiddly a bit too finicky and quite the woggle-bug to do work so I just tried to set my sound up as best as I can and hope to be able to fix it with EQ should I need to later now some bad news um attempt to record vocals and as you can imagine I really don't have access to a single right now I actually wanted to use an terrorists altitude mobile to fix my terrible singing but unfortunately it hasn't been working for some months now you get some hisses you get some pops and delays while recording some version of iPad always broke it a few months back and we're still waiting on attacks in other words I'm quite sorry for my singing secondly the iPad pro now has to do quality microphones so I wanted to sing directly into the iPad now obviously that's a pretty vague marketing term there are a lot of different microphones you can find in the studio dynamic out membrane ribbon mics card you a blob whatever obviously I didn't expect it to sound amazing I just did it for the memes this microphone does sound pretty good when dealing with even dynamics youtuber iphonedo recorded a really awesome acoustic guitar track with the iPad pro mics but when it comes to high dynamics this is another dynamic microphone like in the song in the beginning and silent by the Carlos I'm already yelling and it's constantly changing up the frequency response on me which made it pretty hard to mix afterwards also check me out using my winter hat as a pop filter now it's time to mix everything thank you it beat maker to has all the basic tools that I need parametric EQ buzz tracks and the compressor which supports sidechain it still wasn't the best experience the interface can only show you one effect at a time one instrument for the time so it was fiddly to say the least still global and I'm pretty sure that someone who's better than me at this would have been able to come up with a better sound time for the Big Finish the final mastering I used grand finale' by clever friend and I'm very sorry if I'm butchering that name I like this developer there are apps or skimmed simple you have everything you need in a very elegant interface so about thirty two versions of mastering later I think I was done so before we go ahead and listen to the sound final thoughts can you actually make entire songs on this thing probably yeah sure you're not going to want to though I'm thinking for simple tracks maybe royalty-free music you can definitely find some apps with the proper samples that work great together don't need a lot of mastering and not a lot of fiddling so you can turn out products easily even while on the go for the actual writing process of the song I actually really enjoyed the tools that the iPad gave me and I can imagine it's a great tool to just add to your studio for its interface and features but if you intend to record actual instruments then mix them with samples from different sources and EQ and master it's not impossible but it's quite fiddly quite a bit of a headache and I imagine people prefer to use a computer still for that big big project [Music] [Applause] [Music] the cognise relations but it's a vacation there's a real confrontation ooh towels down because it's full of toilet paper my brother sockets open I could collect weather and think which brand of bridges pastor drink [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] situation [Music] [Applause] [Music] well you've made it this far duplicated it let me know in the comments below if you liked it let me know in the comments below also there's a subscribe button somewhere around there maybe a like button hmmm-hmmm see you next time [Music]
