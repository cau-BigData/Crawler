this is one of the biggest boxes that we have received in the office hello guys my name is Vic with phone arena and inside this box is the brand new one plus 70 so let's open it up and take take notice that this is not your regular box you get just the smaller box but this is a reviewers box so you have a few gifts inside so let's take a look so let's open it up and the first thing that you see is of course it opens in a very futuristic way and inside it you have a signature one plus black notepad to put to the side you also have the tall and narrow box of the phone itself in striking red color with a bold black font that tells you about the oneplus 70 and its design idea to take a closer look at the box a bit later on the other side you also have three cases that you sit purchase separately these are usually not included and who take a closer look at them later on and then you also have the bullets wireless version to some one of the greatest wireless headphones feature great battery life great sound quality and again you probably need to buy these separately they're not coming with the phone but what we want to take a look is at the box itself and let's take a look at the brand new one plus 70 so let's open the box up and what we have inside is the phone in beautiful glacier blue color which is a lighter shade of blue we'll fire it up and take post a lot later on what else you get inside the box or you have some user manuals you have a letter from the oneplus CEO Pete law that thanks you for your purchase and explains a bit more the oneplus idea and the input from users and how it's valuable to the company and you also get a free chase in the box it's a free c2 silicone case some of the companies are selling this for $40 or even more the others for free in the oneplus 71 you think here is the charger which is a warp 30 t which gives you faster speeds in fact it's not the charger that gives you faster speeds but the battery chemistry inside the phone so you can use an older charger and still get the same charging speeds is the new oneplus phone and it's battery that's improved you get the signature red cable USB to USB see and what else you get inside to get a sim tool the phone itself comes with a screen protector that that's a nice touch and that's about it so let's fire up the phone and take a look at it that's a guy's the oneplus 70 features a 6.5 inch screen and of course the big feature for the first time on an affordable phone you get a 90 Hertz refresh rate so everything looks extra smooth extra buttery extra zippy and it's a big difference oneplus 70 comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate 6.5 inch AMOLED display 1080p resolution you see all everything in the details to this video under the hood you get the newest Snapdragon 805 5 plus chip which brings you an improvement to the graphics up to 15% better graphics performance which is a huge help for oneplus as it allows you to get those smoother refresh rate and get the smoother performance with the phone overall let's take a look at the phone itself it features frosted glass she's really nice to the touch we also have a silver version that we can show you right now and on the side you have volume button and on the other side you have the power key and the familiar mute switch that is here again on the oneplus 70 it's a very nice touch you can either set your phone to vibrate to mute it completely or to have it with full sound on you don't have a headphone jack here so no 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the bottom we have a USB C port the speaker of course and the notch itself you see here you have a teardrop notch which is 30% smaller than the 1 plus 7 which is a nice little improvement nothing big and of course on the back is the big change in terms of design it is that round camera bump which now houses three different cameras you have the main 48 megapixel Sony sensor you have a telephoto camera here it's 2 times zoom not three times like on the 1 plus 7 Pro you have the ultra wide camera as well so all three cameras work together it's a nice package and we'll take a look at some pictures later on ok let's jump to the interface and this is the first phone that we see running on Android 10 out of the box and it's not just Android 10 here you have oxygen OS onboard which bring some added optimizations and improvements such as for example now if you're using the phone in landscape mode and use the gesture navigation you can swipe from the bottom and Lenski landscape mode which is just logical oneplus also has a few interesting features like Zen mode it allows you to switch off every notification and just have a peace of mind and it was possible to set it for just 20 minutes and now you can set a custom time so we can leave it on the side for maybe two hours or an hour and important calls will still go through but everything else all other noise is not coming through in terms of biometrics and security you have an optical fingerprint scanner embedded under the display this is the second-generation scanner that works faster than the earlier versions and it works pretty well you don't have 3d face recognition instead you can only get a picture based on face recognition which is not the safest option so we recommend you stick with the optical in screen fingerprint scanner instead hunters of cameras you get some new features here you can now use the ultra wide camera for video and you can also use your wide camera for the nightscape mode which is meant to capture cityscapes at night and get just that wider perspective with your white camera the telephoto camera at two times zoom is a nice addition for portraits and now you can shoot portraits both with this telephoto camera or with the main camera if you want a wider look at the tanks but you have that choice now one important change for video is the new hybrid video stabilization which gives you even smoother and more stable footage and you also have a new macro mode that allows you to capture of objects from very up-close just 2.5 centimeters or just one inch so you can get a close-up shot like this one here of a bug with a lot of detail so it's a nice new feature we should also take a closer look at the wallpapers which are always different with different oneplus falls and here you have a bunch of interesting to live wallpapers that animate in a really nice way and it shows just attention to detail that you don't get on many other phones except let's take a closer look at the cases that you can purchase separately for the oneplus 70 and one of them is the sandstone one which has been a material that the original oneplus launched an and now it's available as the case and just roll back to the original one you can also have a carbon option which is feels very smooth to the touch and gives you a little bit of extra protection and for the most protection you have a all-around rubber case in a bold red color which will give you the maximum protection so that's guys a quick look at the oneplus 70 your really exciting mid-range phone with flagship level specs with a great camera a ton of new features the first phone would get too fast with the Android ten and a lot more so the phone will first be available in India and the United States and coming and it's coming later on to Europe as well prices will be announced soon and you'll
