the new Moto G 8 plus is a big phone with the big four thousand milliamp hour battery and it comes with an action camera on his back and a few tricks up his sleeve hello Internet Vic here with vulnera and the g8 plus is Motorola's new budget offering sold at a price of less than three hundred dollars and have already used it for a couple of days these are our first impressions first inside the box you find a fast charger a standard USB to USB C cable and a clear case which is a nice extra the phone itself has a fully plastic body but it looks good if you keep it clean with a nice gradient on the back but it is an absolute fingerprint magnet on the back you'd find the traditional fingerprint scanner with the moto logo in it and it works without any issues it's actually a bit more reliable than the trendy in screen fingerprint scanners commonly used in expensive phones these days on the top you have a headphone jack tool so you can easily plug in your headphones without any dongles the screen is 6.3 inches in size with a full HD resolution and well it is big and it features small bezels with only a tiny teardrop notch at the top it's also an LCD screen and color solid don't look nowhere nearly as impressive as colors on AMOLED screens viewing angles are also not great and while you do have three color modes and settings all of them feature colors that look very cold and like in vibrancy these days you can get a phone with a beautiful AMOLED screen like the galaxy 850 at about the same price so moto has few excuses for the screen but has its other advantages the clean interface is one of them the phone is powered by the mid-range snapdragon 616 you have four gigs of ram not a lot but now so that the phone runs fast and without hiccups it also gets a lot of the little things right the Moto actions tricks are not new but are still quite fun you twist the phone to open the camera or double chop to start the flashlight or tap it with three fingers to take a screenshot one thing with this like though is moto steak on gesture navigation what you get here is the one-button gesture nav which is fiddly doesn't work very well we hate to be too picky for a budget phone but then a few months since Android 10 is out and the ga+ still counts with the older Android 9 version so you're missing out on some of the new stuff and especially on the much improved google gesture navigation the one thing that you might want the g8 plus four is the new camera system you have a 48 megapixel main camera that does a decent job capturing photos and you can check out a few shots with captures with the phone and it even has a dedicated night mode to get more light in the dark but the real highlight is the ultra wide-angle camera that you can only use for video Motorola got really clever and turn the sensor at the 90 degree angle so you can shoot landscape videos while you hold the phone in portrait orientation and it basically turns it into an action camera of sorts coupled with the quite good stabilization and 4k video support this might not replace a GoPro but it surely will allow you to get some awesome footage that you simply cannot capture with other phones the third camera that you are seeing here is a depth sensor that comes in handy when you take part with follows with a blurred background and you can customize the amount of blur right in the camera under the hood the moto G 8 plus comes with a quite big 4000 milliamp hour battery that we have not tested in detail yet but our first impressions are that it gives us almost two days of use more than your average phone by a good margin the fast charger included in the box delivers 18 watts of power so the battery will charge up quicker too and that is our first look at the Moto G 8 plus a phone that in many ways feels like a bigger sibling to the Moto 1 action how do you like it there's no your thoughts in the comments we read all of them don't forget to like the video subscribe for more my name is Vic Mel talk to you next time right here on phone arena [Music]
