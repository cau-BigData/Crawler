the desire to own the latest and greatest smartphone is an understandable one even you've been carrying a smartphone since the days they were just PDA the cellular connectivity there's still a thrill to coming home with the latest Hardware armed with blistering fast performance the hottest new features and featuring a sleek futuristic design for Apple fans this is the time of year to go shopping for a new iPhone but this year the question of which model to go with is trickier than ever you go with a standard iPhone 7 with a 12 megapixel camera a very respectable camera with an X 1.8 aperture and extended color range or if you double down on image taking hardware with the new iPhone 7 plus and it's all new dual camera arrangement the two cameras mean pictures that look twice as good and what about those other iPhone 7 plus enhancements like the extra RAM and extended battery did they add up to making the 7 Plus this year's must-have upgrade I'm Steven shank with phone arena and you're watching my full review of the Apple iPhone 7 plus the iPhone 7 is a handset that's all about refinement taking the familiar look at the 6 and the 6s streamlining that design with a new solid state home button fading into the background antenna lines and a long-overdue dose of water-resistant construction it's very much a derivative phone and that's great because apples really nailing what's working for it while also not being afraid to tweak a few things here and there in the aim of perfection even if that includes the controversial move to drop the familiar headphone jack and while the iPhone 7 plus builds off those same choices that brought us the iPhone 7 it pushes out on its own in the way we haven't quite seen from a Plus model before really emphasizing that this isn't just about big iPhones and little iPhones but about the user experience these two ultimately distinct phones can offer and a whole lot of that has to do with a fancy new dual rear camera on the 7 plus before we dive full into a look at that new camera hardware let's step back for a broader overview of the new plus sized iPhone the iPhone 7 plus comes in with the very same footprint as the iPhone 6s plus button placement remains consistent but if you look closely you can already spot some of the ways Apple has been refining its design like removing the shallow cutout between volume keys while button placement may be the same the hardware itself is evolving and the biggest difference here is the presence of a new home button it still got touch ID which continues to make authentication quick and painless but now it's no longer a physical button that moves and clicks when you press it instead the new solid state component responds to finger pressure in much the same way as the screens 3d touch system and the phones tapped ik Engine recognizes a firm button press with an emulated click of its own it doesn't feel quite right at first but the illusion quickly overtakes you and you'll forget the button isn't really clicking at all in no time continuing our tour around the phone's body we see that big new camera Bolg around back housing the pair of 12 megapixel shooters and flanked by the upgraded quad LED flash and while that stretched out camera bump may be the most attention-getting component of phones backside we're also very interested in what our eyes aren't drawn to namely the tucked away antenna stripes they're more visible on other iPhone 7 plus color options but with this black palette they practically fade into nothingness and that makes for a really nice clean look finally we can't ignore what's happening down south and it wouldn't be an iPhone 7 plus discussion without talking about Apple's decision to remove its phone's analogue headphone jack instead users now have to make a choice go with new headphones that connect over lightning cables like the pair of new ear pods that shipped with a smartphone carry around the included lightning to analog adapter Apple provide and keep on rockin your old pair of headphones or just go full-on Wireless with a Bluetooth pair maybe like the soon to land Apple earpods doing away with ports may seem like moving backwards some of you but it definitely makes one job much easier for Apple sealing up one point of entry as the manufacturer brings us its first ever formerly water-resistant iPhones like the iPhone 7 and new Apple watch the iPhone 7 plus offers water and dust resistance you probably won't want to try using it while scuba diving but Apple's harden the phone's body against the threat of water penetration from things like casual splashes sprays and even a not too deep drop underwater while all this hardware comes together in a package that's the same basic size as last year's iPhone plus Apple still managed to shave a few grams off its weight giving us a lightest plus model since the original 6 with everything staying the same size it shouldn't be a shock to learn that Apple's brought us another plus phone with a 5.5 inch display resolution stays at 1080 by 1920 but Apple brings the panel the same sort of upgrades also picked up at the iPhone 7 higher brightness and increased color range in its official docs Apple claims of both the seven and seven plus should share the same brighter screen tech but an hour test the plus actually came out significantly ahead with a display much brighter than even Apple advertised and hey who doesn't love it when a company under promises and over delivers but while the iPhone 7 plus may compare favorably to other iPhones there are lots of other 5.5 inch handsets out there an apples model though sleek enough on its own can seem positively bulky when placed head-to-head with a more of a t 5.5 Avenger like Samsung's Galaxy s7 edge after upgrading our existing iPhones and iPads to say nothing of spending some time with a smaller iPhone 7 we're intimately familiar with iOS 10 by now and its execution the iPhone 7 plus doesn't really offer any new twists that shipping sound like a complaint though as iOS 10 brings a lot to the table that we really liked from the tricked-out new look of messages with stickers in emoji galore to the convenience of rise to wake and a widget enhanced lockscreen while you can get access to iOS 10 on any number of Apple devices the iPhone 7 plus manages to bring users one of the smoothest implementations of it yet thanks to the power of the phone's new a10 fusion chip and the most Ram we've ever seen on an Apple smartphone in our battery of benchmark tests the iPhone 7 plus an iPhone 7 also packin that same a10 fusion processor went head-to-head for the top spot sometimes the plus took the honor while other times the 7 itself pulled ahead possibly due to reduced rendering requirements of the lower res screen but not only does the 7 plus offer this kinds of great performance but it also features 3 gigabytes of RAM to the 7s two gigs helping to prepare this handset for dealing with particularly demanding apps or just a lot of regular ones speaking of apps you're going to have plenty of room for though thanks to the new base level of 32 gigs of storage for this year's iPhones the 7 plus included while the days of 16 gigs have long been numbered it was especially frustrating to see such paltry storage on this top shelf phablet so we're glad to finally see it go and a 16 gigs retires Apple hooks us up with a new high-end storage option providing a 256 gigabyte model for users who simply can't get enough space just like with the iPhone 7 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte storage tears are also connected to Apple's limited availability jet black color option you won't find any 32gig jet-black iPhone 7 plus in addition to glossy jet-black the iPhone 7s color options are joined by the matte black you see here as well as the return of silver gold and rose gold the big story with multimedia this year maybe the iPhone losing a tech bonejack but we do gain something in the process as the iPhone 7 plus picks up a pair of stereo speakers the bottom mounted component we're familiar with from years past is now joined by a speaker in the phone's earpiece and the pair of them together sounds pretty good like with the iPhone 7 though we've noticed how the ear speaker is a lot lighter on the base in the bottom edge component making things sound a little unbalanced at times but at least it's really loud and combined with a big 5.5 inch screen that makes the iPhone 7 plus a good phone for sharing video with friends oK we've been taking our time getting here but how about that camera Apple doubles up on its camera tech with the iPhone 7 plus pairing the wide-angle 12 megapixel camera from the iPhone 7 with its bright f1 pointed aperture with a second 12 megapixel camera this one equipped with an F 2.8 telephoto lens well that arrangement sounds like one that could make photo taking unnecessarily complicated Apple software makes dealing with the Peres breeze just keep the camera in 1x mode for wide shots and tap the button once for an effortless 2x zoom that's it switching back and forth is painless with no worries about long waits while refocusing and if you really do want to push limits digital zoom extends to an admittedly noisy 10x just like dual camera smartphones on Android apples not above using the iPhone 7 plus as pair to pull off some neat shooting effects promising a cool controlled blur bokeh portrait mode unfortunately that one's not ready just yet or at least it's only available in beta that's an odd move for Apple to launch hardware like this without all the software ready but we're still eager to give it a shot once it arrives video performance on the iPhone 7 plus is as smooth and crisp as we'd expect from our experience with the iPhone 7 but the availability of zoom adds a great new twist to the execution you can jump in and out of them without taking a break from filming making sure you don't miss any important moments all this new hardware demands a lot of electricity an Apple responds by upping battery size from last year giving the iPhone 7 plus a twenty nine hundred million power component that's around five percent larger than the six Plus had sadly that doesn't translate into a similar gain and battery life and our testing showed the seven plus coming in at just about the same time as the six plus even a few minutes shorter actually still with a brighter screen faster processor more RAM and an extra camera things could be a lot worse and admittedly we're resigned to be happy just not seeing a bigger loss with the new iPhone 7 plus apples given us one of the most compelling reasons yet to say goodbye to smaller iPhones and embrace the plus for all of its extras battery life adds an hour and a half over what you get with the iPhone 7 extra RAM gives software room to grow and maybe more than anything the two times zoom when the new dual cameras telephoto lens will change the way you take pics and shoot video very much for the better still apples 5.5 inch handset is starting to feel a little bit on the large side while we appreciate the desire to return to a familiar design maybe this time to start tightening up those bezels and shrinking the overall build a little still if you don't mind the size this is the iPhone to get well worth the price of admission even as we wait for some new features to arrive via software update if not the iPhone 7 still won't steal you're wrong and who knows maybe next year the 7s will inherit the dual camera from the plus giving us the best of both worlds for now though I'm Steven shank with phone arena thanks for watching and be sure to subscribe so you don't miss any of our
