the Motorola one action truly awarness over Motorola calls it the first phone with an action camera and while it may not replace your GoPro it's pretty damn close hello youtube my name is Vic with fawn arena and this phone has superb video stabilization and the whole phone itself is designed around the concept of being an action camera take a look at the design the one action may have a 6.3 inch display but don't let that diagonal size fool you it's actually a 21 by 9 aspect ratio screen which means that the phone is very tall but very narrow the handset is grippy organ AMA can light by the way it may look like it's made of metal and glass but the Motorola one action is fully plastic we really don't mind the choice of materials here considering that this is a phone that's supposed to be constantly handled and put in danger of being dropped it does have action ends name right but then we have to wonder why does it not have any sort of waterproofing the Motorola one action is rated for IP x2 which is basically just splash protection keep it away from pools or Jets of water the screen itself gets the job done but we wouldn't call it impressive it looks bluish and cold the colors are not very accurate and the LCD panels backlight bleed is easily noticeable at least it gets very bright and the phone was perfectly usable out on a sunny day you also can't expect wonders from the hardware interestingly enough the Motorola one action is powered by a Samsung chipset the Exynos 96 online comes its humble home underneath the hood it runs okay at best but we did experience stutters and framedrops while operating the phone in our day to day lives but enough about all that let's talk about that action camera Motorola went ahead and installed the sensor horizontally meaning that you can take a 16 by 9 video while holding the phone upright with just one hand this will instantly put a stop to the portrait video complaints in your comment section the lens on this thing offers a 117 degree viewing angle which helps you get a lot of stuff into the frame and it's stabilization and handling of dynamics and colors is superb as you can see in our sample videos here you can no joke get the Motorola one action to use it as a budget action camera which also happens to come with Android onboard now there are a couple of shortcomings you need to be aware of the sideways mounted sensor is a great idea for handheld recording yes but let's remind you that almost every smartphone tripod or mount out there will turn your device horizontally then this means that if you want to put the Motorola one action on a mount and record something hands-free you might need to get creative also at the time of this review you can't use the wide action camera to take photos with which we have no idea why that's not a thing the regular camera is a different story it's an OK shooter which can take some sharp photos with good colors but this dynamic range is pretty limited it's very easy to get burn outs or black shadows and shots and you almost always have to play with the exposure settings on the phone do that pick your framing right and you may end up with some pretty okay photos for your Instagram feed when it comes to my shots that's a lost cause blurry light sources and lots of grain are a given but that kind of goes with the territory for mid-range phone Motorola 1 action is currently available in some international markets for around $300 if it lands in the USA at that price point we'd say it's a pretty good deal as long as you intend to use a section camera day in and day out in fact for the money it's worth buying it just for the action camera and using its phone features as an extra on top but if you're looking for more of a phone and less of an action camera you may want to look at some other models like the Moto G 7 which offers a metal and glass build and better performance overall and that wraps up our review of the moto 1 action we can find links to videos and photos in the description below my name is Vic was a pleasure talking to you and I'll see you next time here on Reno [Applause] you
