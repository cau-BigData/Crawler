[Music] the Samsung Galaxy Note fan is here and it's not just one phone but for the first time in the history of the note series you now have a more compact Galaxy Note 10 in addition to the standard larger model that now goes by the name of no 10 plus so what new features did the note 10 series bring and what's new with the s-pen hello guys my name is Vic with vulnera and I have used both new note 10 phones and I can say one thing have impressed first though unimportant warning no 10 phones don't bring any revolutionary new features no superzoom cameras no new camera sensors the same Snapdragon 805 processor in the S 10 series it's possible refinement and polish there is one radical change though the headphone jack is gone on both phones Samsung was the last mainstream company to keep the convenient headphone jack and now it's removed at - you don't get a dongle in the box but you do get a pair of USB C in your headphones tuned by AKG that should do a good job one more thing stands out there is no big big button - we're actually quite happy to see it gone I would often accidentally press that button on previous Samsung phones and it will interrupt the experience and if you want the Bigsby assistant you can still access it with a long hold on the power button we should also say that another staple of the Samsung experience the microsd expandable card slot is only available on the larger note 10 plus you don't have a microSD option on the smaller note 10 but we really don't mind much after all the base versions of the note 10 and no 10 plus both start with a generous 256 gigabytes of on-board storage that would please most people in times when other flagship phones still ship with nearly 64 gigs of storage samsung really shows that it can flex its muscle with four times as much storage with all the said let's now look close the Falls and boy do they look really well-designed with a solid premium feel the bezels are trimmed to a bare minimum making way for the beautiful and bright dynamic AMOLED screen to shine those screens are the true highlight here with vibrant colors excellent viewing angles and the great contrast they are a joy we have a 6 point 3 inch screen diagonal on the note 10 and a 6 point 8 inch size on the note 10 plus one important difference between the 10 and the plus model is the resolution the regular note 10 features a full HD resolution while the note 10 plus rocks a quad HD resolution it looks a bit sharper but really it is a tiny difference if you hardly even notice in real use on the camera front you have the versatility of Samsung's triple camera system you have a normal lens a 2 times zoom telephoto lens now with a wider aperture so it's faster and an ultra wide-angle shooter the no 10 Plus model also has a fourth depth sensor for more precise portrait shots or a samsung calls them live focus new in the camera app is the full AR duo option where you draw on top of your video and the drawing sticks to your face and moves with it it's a gimmick but the fun one you also have live focus video meaning that you can blur the background and leave the subject in sharp focus which looks really cinematic and works mostly well the S Pen is here too it's the defining feature of the null series and this time it doesn't just have a couple of new features it physically feels like a much more solid piece of gear now has a unibody design that feels extremely sturdy much more durable when you compare it against the plastic you feel that you had in the S Pen and earlier notes it's a night and day difference this new S Pen will also automatically charge once tucked inside the note and it now features a new lithium titanium battery that lasts much longer than before so now you can get up to ten hours of standby time on it there is of the features all the familiar tricks are still available you can still take the S Pen out and hop up directly to the lockscreen mammals to quickly jot down things the pop-up s menu hover is a bit different it's now a list instead of a carousel and it's easier to navigate Samsung has improved its notes application so it now doesn't much better job recognizing your handwriting and you can easily export those notes to a Microsoft Word format then you have the new air gestures in the camera you still use the s-pen as a remote control to take a photo but now you can also hold the S Pen button and swipe up to switch between the front and rear cameras you can switch between the camera modes with a swipe to the side you can even zoom in using these new gestures like the circle with the s-pen under the hood the Snapdragon 855 power is a show in the US based models while the rest of the world will get the note 10 series with the company's own 7 nanometre Exynos chip both the small note 10 and the larger note m+ who have the same processors but they will differ in the amount of RAM you have 8 gigs around on the note 10 in an absolutely massive 12 gigabytes of RAM on the plus model overkill yes good to use absolutely of course the larger model also comes with the bigger battery while the note 10 will have a 3500 milliamp hour battery cell the Plus version will feature a massive 43 hundred million power battery that will last bit longer both will support fast wired charge and who come with a wall adapter that provides charging speeds of up to 25 watts if you buy a compatible adapter that will be sold separately the no 10 plus will also be able to charge up even faster in speeds of up to 45 watts both models will also support wireless charging finally I should say that after looking at all the new features I grab the old note 9 alongside for a quick comparison and it looked so outdated yes Samsung might not have made anything revolutionary but the more mother and cleaner design and the beautiful edge to edge screen really make a big difference for me personally the no 10 series are some of the most exciting new phones I have seen in a while would you be getting one let me know in the comments thanks for being with us my name is Vic and I will talk to you next time with our next review right here on phone arena
