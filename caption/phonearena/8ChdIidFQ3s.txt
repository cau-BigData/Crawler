what are the best games of the year for iPhone and Android phones from shooters to role-playing games we take a look at the games that got us hooked the most this year and we're starting with the biggest release Call of Duty mobile Call of Duty mobile quickly became the most downloaded game soon after being released on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and of course a lot of this has to do with brand recognition but make no mistake when it comes to first-person shooters on a phone call of duty' really is among the best it is evident that a lot of effort was made to make the controls as smooth and precise as possible considering the touch input the fact that its matches play out on the most popular multiplayer maps in Call of Duty history makes it very easy to jump in and play for gamers that are familiar with the franchise it doesn't support external controllers and it's unclear if it will in the future although developer Tencent has said it's considering it if number two we have brawl stars developer supercell certainly knows how to make games that just blow up on mobile we've all heard of clash of clans right in 2019 the company released brawl stars which is an action-packed competitive hero based shooter from bird's eye view and again it just became insanely popular in no time the game is free-to-play and you can get a lot of matches from it without needing to pay as you can probably imagine you can pay money to unlock heroes or level up faster instead of grinding for them next up on the list comes sky children of the light this is a beautiful 3d platformer that sends you on a journey to find some fallen stars and restore them it has a meditative quality to it with beautiful visuals and soft ambient sounds it also has a multiplayer element as you can see other players being on the same journey as you while the gameplay itself is strictly single-player the game does carry that sense of a shared goal and camaraderie as you run alongside many shadows of others it's a free-to-play game that is out on iOS and available as an early access app for Android number four is dota under Lords all or chess although chess has been an unexpected hit it started out as a mod for dota 2 then moved on to being its own thing as a separate mobile and PC game valve also noticed that the mod is super popular so it launched its own version of all the chests that's dota under Lords in any case both titles are very similar their gameplay is an addictive mix between turn-based strategy resource management and tower defense one has to try to fully grasp it thankfully both games are free to play at number 5 we have our Magette our Magette isn't all out guns blazing side-scrolling team deathmatch game you can throw a futuristic soldier with a jetpack and a big bad weapon facing others in a fast-paced three minute long matches it's also cross-platform meaning you can play against people on PC Mac Android or iOS your account is shared across your own platforms so whatever your character has unlocked on mobile you have on PC as well next up comes grim valor this is a pretty amazing side-scrolling game that puts heavy emphasis on exploration and challenging combat it is a bit Souls like on a few points the bosses can destroy you really really fast the combat is centered around well-timed dodges and resting at an altar will heal you but also respawn all of your enemies let's add we found it to be much easier than an original Souls game but it's still super fun and satisfying to kill a boss without being hit once at number 7 we have odd mar a quirky platformer where we control odd mark the dwarf through an epic adventure of mostly collecting coins this one feels like it drew some inspiration from super mario and all the good ways you've got a lot of obstacles to jump over fall through or bounce off of you've got plenty of enemies we should defeat by stepping on them the level design is solid and animations are smooth fun and quirky next you should also look at our chair oh this is a roguelike top-down shooter which sends you in demon infested dungeons time and time with each run you gather gold items and experience which lets you level up your character between level restarts there are a ton of weapons and skill variations to try out as low as monster patterns to learn 213 hard to beat chapters number 9 and our ranking is mu origin to a dungeon crawling through them up that looks like it drew a lot of inspiration from Diablo 3 but also has some sprinkles of bigger MMORPGs in there for example you can ride the mount as you traverse the rather enormous world of MU you can team up with others or even join guilds to go on raids together or you can join the arena for 4 versus 14 fights or 1v1 that matches the game is free to play so there is some quite obnoxious in-game monetization for example paying users can literally buy experience points which is basically half the RPG game experience so maybe it will be a good idea to stay away from PvP and just try the quests first last at number 10 but definitely not least is stardew valley stardew valley is an oddball farming simulator game that somehow became viral the game has been available on multiple platforms over the past 3 years and finally made it to mobile in 2019 don't be deceived by the pixel art the game is deceptively deep it has a ton of seeds to plant barn animals to care for in villagers to build bonds with there's even some light battle elements is you fend off bees that are hiding around your land in a strong social component if you choose to go multiplayer and this runs up our top 10 of the best games of the year there were dozens if not hundreds of high quality games out there and we didn't even scratch apple arcade titles so of course some great games did not quite make the cut but that's the beauty of YouTube you can go into the comments and tell us which game you think should have been included and which one
