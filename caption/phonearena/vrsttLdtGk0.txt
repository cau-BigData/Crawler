hey guys John V from phone arena here good quick unboxing of the iPhone 6s plus 6s plus so this is the phablet version of the new iPhone it complements the 6s latest smartphones from Apple in let's just get started talk about the packaging here so what's a little bit different from before is that you have now you know slowly different look with the front bus because in previous years it was just a subtle subtle no design to it you just saw the subtle shape of the iPhone but now you have some more details here so you can see the the spacers on the sides here the plastic bandings and of course you have now an image here look give a little more colorful package but besides that pretty typical iPhone 6s plus logo right there Apple logo in the back and on the sides and this is the 16 gigabyte rose gold iPhone I believe this is for t-mobile so what let's just jump in and just do this quick unboxing here so let's just open this guy this time the proper way got that fat fat okay so we got that let's put that away and let's see what comes out ready there we go so a little bit heftier notice that wait okay so I just fall down right onto the table here here is the iPhone 6s plus in rose gold now it's weird because I have some weird lighting going on I have an incandescent light ain't combined with some fluorescents so the lighting might be a little bit little bit off so it looks at times a little bit silver now when you tilt it a different angle it looks a little bit gold and then at some angles it looks more Sam and I really don't see a strong presence of pink right now but I am called color blind as well so anyway so this is the rose gold version I'm going to turn it on right here real quick I've been different about design per se you know the hardware is gonna be a little bit different course or very different but in terms of the overall design footprint to the language it's just identical to Asher's model so let's put that aside right here well that limits up let's check out and see well so we got in the packaging here so a typical Apple Apple nothing should be different with it so with that we have things like documentation some phone information and those typical Apple decals here so you have that and lastly you just have the usual set of accessories that includes lightning cable the wall charger and the earpods so nothing different simple straightforward minimalist packaging occupies a very minimal amount of space which is nice I guess you know when you're when you have this you know warehouse you had to rent a warehouse and all that space adds up it's nice you know I'm pressure they're saving some sort of money in having such a minimal footprint here so let's take a look at the phone I'm not going to go into too much detail about these specs because by now you should all know what entails it's going to quickly set this up here see if we can get this up and running so I quickly show you on your Wes 9 here if you haven't seen it already some of the notable stuff with the phone now includes 3d touch you have also faster processor I believe saying it's same display same resolution size all that nothing different faster processor bleep a little bit more RAM newer camera which is great so higher megapixel camera same thing with the front-facing one and they said it also has a faster touch ID sensor for even faster unlocking and whatnot so we'll see about that here so wait while this loads up let's take out the plastic here it looks good it feels good too of course now I'm holding this it's um it's actually it still feels the same way to me but I had to check it out against the other one now the iPhone six-plus Lasha was already pretty heavy for me I thought was pretty heavy so well you know this has a good amount substance to it'll be interesting to see how much heavier it feels so let me set this up later oh just set it up later there and see what else so that's  so hopefully this loads up here get this connected just to show you the 3d touch and whatnot if this loads taking some time here okay maybe not try hit the home button still working its magic but anyway that is it with the unboxing I'll be checking it out testing it out see Affairs yeah there we go agree agree but if you guys want to learn more about it you could check out our website phone Reno coms janvi thanks for watching
