hey everybody Vic Christophe here with phone arena coming at you from my home as we all stay inside to slow down the corona virus pandemic we had fallen arenal of the best and greatest phones that push the boundaries with incredible new cameras super high refresh rates and a bunch of great innovation but in these tough times ahead we also understand that not everybody will be able to afford the very best phone out there so that's why we have compiled a list of what are our favorite phones for those of you who need to get a phone right now a phone that they will love without having to spend a thousand or more dollars on it let's get started with the best phone deals around and also the most underrated phones right now in 2020 and we kick it off with one of the best camera phones that you can get the Google pixel 3xl Google's finest phone last year is this year's amazing deal at the moment of shooting this you can get this phone at the price of just four hundred and fifty dollars which is exactly half of its original price the pixel 3xl is a big phone with a good-looking AMOLED screen but the reason to get it is the clean software that was incredibly fast and the updates that it is first in line to receive over the next two years and of course that camera can take just stunning photos take a look at a few shots we captured on it and see for yourself the second great deal that we recommend is the Apple iPhone 10 R which now costs $600 the only major thing that you would be missing compared to the newer iPhone 11 is that ultra wide-angle camera and for all else the iPhone Tanner is pretty much the same it runs on iOS so you can use it with the Apple watch and other gadgets the airports for example it runs very smoothly it's got excellent battery life when the camera performance is great too so definitely consider it next on our list is another phone that isn't absolutes to you and that I have personally used for a couple of months and regretted having to switch away from it that phone is the oneplus 70 currently sold at just $500 this phone can do it all is the only one in this list that features a 90 Hertz refresh rate screen and thanks to that it has those smooth moves that you don't quite get on the other options on the other phones battery life is solid the screen quality is great and what I personally love about this phone is just how compact and easy it is to use with just one hand did we mention this super cool mute switch now the only downside here is the camera that is not quite great but if you don't absolutely insist on that you'll love the oneplus 70 and it's a great value for the money - next we have the big guns from the big boys these are not the latest phones that cost a fortune though first we recommend you to definitely consider the Samsung Galaxy S 10 yes last year's s10 it costs merely $600 at the moment and it's a device that will not disappoint it's got probably the highest quality display of all phones in this list it's got a great camera and battery life is above average - and if you want a slightly bigger phone the Galaxy S 10 plus with the price of $700 is another outstanding option last on our list we have another one for the Apple squad and that's the iPhone 10s max this is the phone that I have been using personally in the past couple of weeks as my daily driver throughout these a virus quarantine times and I love it if you go with the 10s max over the newer iPhone 11 Pro max you'll save quite a lot now the 10s max is available as a refurbished unit only over at Apple for eight hundred dollars and you can find it in mint condition websites like swapper for a lot less than that first it's got a great camera and that's important the iOS platform also has multiple years of updates yet the beautiful AMOLED screen and face ID also works great and these are the phones that we think often go under the radar these days but don't really deserve to these are excellent devices now solve for reasonable prices and let's face it spending $1,400 on a brand new phone in these troubled times might not be the most reasonable thing to do so what do you think about them which of these devices would you go for let me know in the comments and meanwhile stay smart protect yourself and the people around you we wish you all to be well and healthy my name is Vic this is fallen arena and I will see you in the next one [Music] you
