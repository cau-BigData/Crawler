hello everyone victor with fawn arena and today I have something exciting to show you and this is the brand new galaxy a 51 the newest mid-range phone by Samsung that will be sold at about the same price is this here extremely popular device the Google pixel 3a and we all know the Google pixel 3a is one of the best budget phones for one simple reason it brings a revolutionary camera experience at a price of just around 350 dollars this phone is able to capture images that are comparable to those on flagship phones that cost three times as much so what about this new galaxy 51 you can see right here in the back it has a very imposing new camera island for this thing cameras it should be able to challenge the Google pixel 3a in the camera Department and the thrown it from its number one position but is it really so let's take a closer look in our 1v1 comparison this is a plastic phone the Samsung really paid attention to the details here we have the black version here it looks very nice if you tilt it at an angle it captures light and reflects it in a very captivating manner now it's a plastic phone as we told you so it will stretch easier but one advantage that you have with plastic phones the pixel 3a for example also plastic foam if you drop it it won't shatter it won't break like glass phones so this is definitely one important advantage it also makes the phone lighter it gives it a better reception so these are the practical advantages of plastic phones to in compare these two you see some obvious differences you see there's almost no bezel here the punch hole design everything looks very elegant very discreet very good-looking the Google pixel 3 on the other hand has a very prominent top and bottom bezels so if you want the bigger screen and the more immersive experience of course the galaxy a 51 has the advantage in this department so speaking of design the galaxy 51 wins this round next up let's look at the pours here in the buttons the buttons are on the right hand side you have a power button the volume keys and on the bottom of both phones you have USB C for charging USB C is the standard in 2020 and we're glad it's so it's just one cable you don't have to worry about it on the bottom of the galaxy 51 you also notice a 3.5 mm headphone jack another useful convenience that you don't get on more expensive phone and speaking of comparisons the pixel 3a has the headphone jack as well but it's on the top of the phone so you don't need to worry about dongles on each of these phones both of these phones sold at around 350 dollars come with AMOLED screens and this is the next generation that comes after LCD screens which gives you better color saturation better viewing angles deeper blacks an overall better experience and it's really shocking guys that the iPhone 11 for example just an example comes to mind the phone that costs around $700 still comes with an LCD screen with a much lower resolution and both of these Falls are 1080p full-hd perfectly crispy perfectly sharp now of course if you want that more immersive screen the galaxy 51 has a bigger 6.5 inch display this one here is 5.6 inches you can see a 51 is a little bit taller so it has a 20 by 9 aspect ratio the galaxy 51 you also have one option that is I find extremely useful and if you go into settings and display you can adjust the colors to either a vivid mold it gives you more boosted colors or you can choose the neutral mode which gives you more toned down colors the next thing on the list that we should discuss is right here in the back of the Google pixels VA you find the good old fingerprint scanner a traditional capacitive one which works extremely well extremely reliable fast no issues whatsoever here in the galaxy 51 you have an in display fingerprint scanner so it's built right here under the screen you have to tap it and hold it for a while in order for it to work and most of the time it does but here's the thing that's most of the time and not all of the time and it's nowhere nearly as quick as the fingerprint scanner on the Google pixel 3a so in terms of biometrics and security the pixel wins this round next up we should also talk performance and you should know the specs of course first we have the Google pixel 3/8 ones of the snap 6:17 chip four gigabytes of RAM here you have a Samsung made processor the Exynos 96 11 again four gigabytes of RAM you also have a version with six what we have the four gig one and these numbers and these names shouldn't tell you anything what matters is the real life performance of course and the real life performance tells you the following story will pixel to a buttery smooth performance it's not the fastest one and if you load an app or a game or something that's more intense it will take an extra second or so but it feels smooth it feels uninterrupted it feels good to use the galaxy 851 it gets the job done but it's nowhere nearly as buttery smooth and if you use the particularly the new gesture navigation that comes with Android 10 on this phone and speaking of software we should say that both of these phones run on Android 10 here you have Samsung's one UI interface on top here you have a pretty clean version of Android but the performance of the galaxy 51 gets a little bit choppy especially if you have a slightly more challenging load on the phone terms of performance and speak the galaxy 51 loses this round but here's something interesting the galaxy 51 comes with 128 gigs of on-board storage and that's a lot for an affordable phone you can easily keep all of your files or videos for years to come and the pixel 2a it only has 64 gigs of on-board storage which is a little bit on the low side Plus this one doesn't support microSD cards and you can expand the memory storage here on the galaxy 51 using micro sd card so in terms of storage the galaxy 51 is the better deal but enough with the host details let's skip to the camera because camera is what you came here to see and these new cameras on the galaxy a 51 the biggest upgrade a new sensor for the main camera compared to last year's a 50 now you have a 48 megapixel main camera this is supposed to take better pictures you have an ultra wide camera as well you miss this one you don't have an ultra wide camera on the pixel 3a you also have a macro camera dedicated macro lens here on the galaxy 51 and even afford lens a time of flight or depth camera but in terms of actual quality when you look at pictures those numbers fade away and the image quality is simply better on the pixel 3a even though it's an 12 megapixel camera is the older phone still has that incredible dynamic range that Google software magic and you can see in the photos right here on your screen how colors detail everything is superior on the Google pixel 3a now what about video shooters if you record a lot of video you'd be happy to learn that the Galaxy a 51 now supports 4k video recording with the main camera but there are a few compromises and a few little caveats that you should know if you want to shoot video on such an affordable phone first of all you can record it the main camera in 4k video resolution but you cannot switch the ultra wide camera if you want to use the wide camera while recording video you have to exit the recording and started all over again using just deal 2 white camera if you start with the old right camera you can not jump back to the main camera so there are a few limitations here how the focusing looks good but you don't get quite as much detail on the galaxy 51 is you do on the pixel 3/8 so overall in terms of the camera experience would definitely give this one to the Google pixel 3a last but not least we want to talk about battery life because there is a big difference between these two now the galaxy 51 comes with a four thousand milliamp hour battery while the cell here on the Google pixel 3 is three thousand milliamp hours that's a big difference what about actual battery life numbers we have tested both of these phones and you should be able to see right here on your screens and the chart we test three different components web browsing YouTube video streaming and 3d gaming and the galaxy a 51 is the superior one in all three of them now it also beats the Google pixel 3 a excel in all aspects except for the 3d gaming so this one really has an exceptional battery life you should be able to get a full day of use easily and if you don't use your phone all that much you can even go two full days without charging the galaxy a 51 while on the Google pixel 3 a you're more likely to need to go to the charger more often the galaxy 51 also supports 15 watts fast charging which fully charges up the phone in about 1 hour and 45 minutes in neither of these phones supports wireless charging so at the end of the day is time to draw the line and see which phone should you get if you have around three hundred and fifty dollars and are shopping for a budget phone that is good well it really depends what you prioritize for me personally it's an easy choice I value a good camera and a good experience good performance these are the areas where the pixel excels the galaxy 51 it has the upper hand when it comes to the screen the more modern design and the battery life but it is a bit of the tree and the camera performance is not quite great so this is guys our quick take our quick comparison between the Google pixel 3a and the Galaxy a 51 which one do you prefer let me know your thoughts about these
