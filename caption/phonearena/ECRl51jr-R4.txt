hello everyone and welcome to another big phone arena battery drain test and this time we have five phones with the brand new oneplus 8 pro at the front oneplus has risen to the very top of the smartphone market from humble beginnings the original oneplus one launched way back in 2014 with a price of just 300 and an ambition to be a quote-unquote flagship killer the latest oneplus 8 pro now costs 1 000 and it's not a budget flagship killer it's just a flagship but nonetheless it's an impressive one and this time we compare it against the very best the samsung galaxy s20 ultra the galaxy s20 plus and then the iphone 11 pro max and the popular iphone 11. so let's quickly go to the battery specs as we prepare the phones to start first the oneplus 8 pro comes with about 40 500 milliamp hour battery you'll see the exact numbers below the galaxy s20 ultra features a 5 000 milliamp power cell the biggest in this test the s20 plus has a 4500 milliamp hour battery about the same size as the oneplus the iphone 11 pro max has a nearly 4 000 milliamp hour battery and finally the iphone 11 comes with the smallest battery cell at a capacity of about 3 100 milliamp hours what you're seeing on your screen right now is our youtube video streaming battery test now this drains the battery on phones a bit faster than just browsing and scrolling the web but some phones are better than others for video and some are worse we won't reveal the names of the phones that are worse but let's just say that they rhyme with iphone and yes the first one to die on this test is the iphone 11 scoring just seven hours and 13 minutes for youtube video streaming not a great showing by any means all other phones still have quite a bit of juice left in the tank it's not until we reach the nearly nine hour mark that we have the next phone to die and that one is the iphone 11 pro max with a score of 8 hours and 58 minutes the oneplus 8 pro lasts just a bit more 9 hours and 15 minutes interestingly the galaxies do great on this test and they just keep on going finally after a while the galaxy s20 plus is the first one to give up at 9 hours and 53 minutes and the winner who get the chicken dinner is the galaxy s20 ultra we wonder what the equivalent of chicken dinner is for a smartphone made of chips maybe the neverending attention of its human creators in 10 hours and 30 minutes of non-stop video playback about does it don't you think so to sum things up the galaxy s20 ultra gets the win in this round while the iphones last way less than other phones for youtube video streaming and that's important especially for those people who watch a lot of youtube videos what you see right now running is our browsing and scrolling test this is our lightest test it uses mainly the cpu a bit and most phones on this test last for more than 10 hours often we're running this test a couple of times on many of the phones to ensure that the results are correct battery testing is quite complex and sometimes results will differ a bit between the runs and we're giving you the average score for each phone and that's why what you see on your screen right now is not the actual test run for each of the phones we don't want to keep you waiting seeing all of the runs for 20 hours or more but what you're seeing instead is a placeholder and that's also the reason why the upper parts of the phones are blurred and with this in mind we have the first phone to die on this test and surprisingly is the oneplus 8 pro it lasted exactly 10 hours and 54 minutes and that's a very good showing but it's just not as good as the others in this test just a half an hour later the next phone to die is the iphone 11. it scores a respectable 11 hours and 25 minutes and shows that apple is able to squeeze out a good amount of battery life out of such a tiny battery cell the lcd screen might also be a bit more frugal and help here next up an hour after the iphone 11 the galaxy s20 ultra bites the dust and ends up this test with a score of 12 hours and 23 minutes we're a bit surprised that the s20 plus which has a smaller battery still keeps on going but it's not long before 2 dies with a score of 12 hours and 14 minutes at this point we only have one phone that's still running and manages to squeeze out a few extra minutes before also finally surrendering at the 12 hour and 53 minute mark that phone is the iphone 11 pro max which gets the w in this test nice showing apple this is the time to also mention that all of the phones were running at 60hz for this test if you're not familiar with mr heinrich hertz an honorable german man who lived in the 19th century and gave his name to cool new smartphone tech and a bunch of other things you should also know that 60hz means that the display on your phone refreshes 60 times a second the s20 series and the oneplus also have the ability to go at double that rate or 120 hertz for a super smooth experience for the end user but that experience has a cost and often a big one in terms of battery life so next up we have just the oneplus 8 pro the galaxy s20 ultra and the galaxy s20 plus only the three phones that support the 120 hertz option and they're running the very same test once again from the start but this time set to the 120 hertz and interestingly the results are just about reversed in this case the first phone to die here is the galaxy s20 plus with a score of just 8 hours and 30 minutes that's a huge drop from the first test when it lasted 12 hours and 40 minutes using the 60hz option the galaxy s20 ultra still keeps on going for a while but it also dies at 9 hours and 40 minutes also way faster than the 12 hours and 23 minutes it was able to last with the 60 hertz option and finally the oneplus 8 pro is the one that still keeps on going and that's a great testament to the work of oneplus engineers the 120hz option might be cool but seeing the battery drop like crazy on samsung phones might have you switching back to the good old 60hz option on the samsung devices meanwhile we are seeing the oneplus 8 pro also finally bite the dust and it finishes with a score of exactly 10 hours and beating the s20 series by a big margin very interesting and our final test is one for the gamers it's called 3d gaming because we use a game that puts a strain on the gpu and we play game with 3d graphics but it's important to know that we played at lower settings so that all phones can run in the same conditions and in real life your battery will likely die much quicker but the idea here is to show the difference between the phones here not to be perfectly realistic with 3d gaming so once again you'll not see the actual test run here but instead the simulation we have run the test a couple of times on these phones to ensure that the results are correct so after some pixel crunching and shader rendering the first phone to die on this test is the iphone 11 pro max it seems that the powerful gpu inside also taxes the battery more and the pro max lasts exactly 7 hours and 30 minutes on this test and yes it's a bit of a surprise that the larger iphone lasts more than the smaller one and interestingly the iphone 11 with a smaller battery but also a much lower resolution screen is able to outlast the pro max in its course 7 minutes more now the other phones last quite a bit more the galaxy s20 plus finishes this test with a score of and 26 minutes then we have to wait a bit more until the galaxy s20 ultra also dies at the 9 hour and 12 minute mark very good showing for samsung phones that last quite a bit yet still the one left and the one who gets the win is the oneplus 8 pro was it for its cooling and internal structure or just that snapdragon 865 chip efficiency the oneplus 8 pro is our new champion when it comes to 3d gaming all phones were tested at 60hz this time around but combine this with the oneplus also offering 120hz option for the hardcore gamers and it's a killer gaming machine especially if you're into pubg mobile or call of duty or other intense games that require a fast reaction and there you have it guys our complete and exhaustive battery test this is a good time to recap the results the iphone 11 pro max won the browsing test but both iphones did terribly with youtube streaming then the galaxy s20 ultra won the youtube battery life test but the galaxies failed pretty much with their 120 hertz option and finally the oneplus 8 pro lasted the longest in the 3d gaming test at the end of the day we're glad to see that the whole industry is moving towards much better battery life even the iphone 11 has some very impressive battery numbers despite a small battery cell and as to the oneplus 8 pro while it's not the absolute battery beast it's definitely not too far away from the iphone 11 pro max and the galaxy s20 ultra and that's it for today my name is vic and i hope you enjoyed watching this test smash that like button if you enjoyed watching testing
