soccer seasons all over the world were put on hold just as the champions in each league we're going to be determined then we're left with nothing but watching replays well we're about to put you back in the action but this time as a player I'm Vic with phone arena and today we have for you the 10 best mobile soccer games or is it football obviously games in this list are just as confused about the name as possible so don't blame us for using the wrong name for your favorite game but this in mind not all of these games are about realistic graphics and licensed teams but they're all about bringing you the soccer experience one way or another let's jump right in and we'll begin with something less serious and more arcade stickman soccer is the name suggest players in this game are all stick men but that doesn't mean they don't have personalities you can play with clubs that sound and look very familiar and through the in-game currencies you can buy the stick versions of popular players if you're not into that you can customise your own team and players to create the perfect mix of stick players the gameplay is fast paced and the controls simple making the game quick to pick up and enjoy the referee standards for what's considered a flower pretty low so you can be a bit more aggressive than usual stigma in soccer allows for local multiplayer with controllers so if you have some laying around it's a great game to play with a friend so maybe even with your kid next we have Soccer Cup 2020 a game with realistic graphics and player movements but the ball mechanics are a bit odd sometimes the ball sometimes sticks to player's feet or the goalkeepers gloves like a magnet overall this game can be hard to master there is an extensive tutorial to help you with that however the developers seem to be using it as a way to make you watch ads before you can even play a real match so some patience is required there are no licensed players in teams so prepare to face masse or Rinaldi their respective store-brand teams not really a big deal since after a while you don't really notice it but unique twists on soccer gameplay are the challenges that you can complete such as the floor is lava and plenty to do in Soccer Cup 2020 that's for sure next game we have a score exclamation mark hero that takes away the boring parts of soccer and instead puts you right in the situations that matter most scoring opportunities the game offers more than 700 challenges from corners to full-fledged offense combinations you'll be put in positions varying from trivial to almost impossible what's great about this game is the D accuracy of your plays is a direct reflection of your input when you manage to curve that ball pass the defense and finish with a volley in the corner it's extremely satisfying plus the turn-by-turn gameplay means you don't have to be stuck to your smartphone screen for minutes at a time as you do with real-time games against human opponents don't get distracted too much however if you miss too many opportunities you need to ward some ads to gain back stamina and there's a simple story that traps the different challenges into one advancing campaign but you'll likely ignore most of what's happening between the stages FIFA football is probably the first game that comes to mind when you saw the title of this video it has the benefit of having all the real players and teams no intentional misspelling here however EA has pushed things a bit too much into the marketing side of things making it seem like the game revolves mostly around opening packs and acquiring better players that's because a big part of FIFA football is the so-called vs attack mode where you get to play out different attacks and try to score while your opponent does the same on his own the better the team the easier the situation's you're putting the likely or it is to win this makes having players with good stats extremely important and while the graphics are great and the game looks appealing this style of gameplay isn't as enjoyable unless you're willing to spend some cash on flair packs next this game will let you forget famous stadiums and superstar players extreme football takes you back to the neighborhood playground where you can show off your mastery of the ball in extreme football you play quick matches in which you control only one player and the rest are either controlled by the in-game AI or better yet your friends and some random opponents the matchmaking system picked out for you you can choose between one versus one two versus two or three versus three so you don't need that many other people to enjoy the there aren't many rules you should worry about just get the ball to the back of the net of course you get to customize your character and have it look the way you want to be represented on the field if you're into the street dive sports games you definitely enjoy extreme football and we continue with dream League Soccer which brings us back to a more traditional approach to soccer the game includes plenty of licensed players if that's important to you and the graphics are satisfyingly good movements are fluid and realistic allowing you to make some nifty moves and impressive finishing strikes when you get the hang of it all of that will be accompanied by a surprisingly good comment rate the game lets you get into the shoes not only of soccer players but also the owner of a soccer club you get to decide how to upgrade and expand the club's base each decision giving your team additional benefits dreamleague soccer is an excellent title to try out if you're bored with the more popular games of the genre football strike is another game that puts you right in the heat of the moment in it you'll face another player of the human variety and either a penalty kick off or target shooting with a timer it's not as close to the real soccer experience as other games but it's extremely engaging and fun for each game you need to pay a fee using the in-game currency that contributes towards a prize pool so as long as you winning you can play until your battery dies by winning you also get tags that are in the shape of a gym bag and contain all sorts of goodies from new hairstyles to balls it to improve your power and accuracy football strike is a great game to kill a few minutes of downtime with a quick round of penalty kicks it might not sound like much fun but you'll be surprised next up the gameplay of soccer star 2020 is similar to strike hero you get to decide the outcomes of different situations by swiping on your screen to aim the ball however in the case of soccer star if you don't get the desired outcome the match goes on with text commentary until the next time your input is needed this gives you the opportunity to redeem yourself later in the game if your initial plays were a bust you're still not as much in control as you would with some other games but if you're often bored with running around wondering whether to pass the ball or not then soccer star 2020 is right up your alley champion of the fields is the next best thing if you're looking for an alternative of the big names our games the game looks good and has precise control so you can make the right play in every situation you get to see some familiar player names just don't expect the flash Ness and grandiose of FIFA this game is more about the experience on the field than what you're doing between the matches that doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to assemble the best impossible of course as with other games better players will improve your chances to land that top corner shot from an impossible angle and lead you to victory at the end of the day however if your terms don't have the dexterity you won't be getting the W so start practicing finally if he for soccer and PS have been fighting over the best soccer simulation ground for a while and on
