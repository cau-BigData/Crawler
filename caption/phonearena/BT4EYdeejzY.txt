hey guys it's John vhere with phone Reena so the new Moto Z 4 indicates that the motor Z series is now on a totally different path it's the latest Moto flagship phone but in the greater scheme of things it has mid-range written all over it it seems as though the motor Z line is now focused more the core experience rather than specs proving that a phone doesn't need all the bells and whistles to be a meaningful handset for the masses the Moto G line has always followed a strict design language due to being moto mod compatible so it's no shock that the Moto Z 4 looks very much like its predecessors it's a tired look at this point but at least the phone is solidly constructed made of Gorilla Glass 5 at the back and Gorilla Glass 3 at the front with a 6000 series aluminum frame around the edges the first noticeable difference is the all screen look with a subtle notch for the front-facing camera gone is the side mounted fingerprint sensor replace instead by an N display of one that works pretty well just as long as your thumbs over it interestingly enough a welcome surprise is the addition of a headphone jack of first for the series one of the biggest selling points of the Moto Z 4 is that it's upgradeable to 5g on Verizon through the help of moto mod just like the Moto Z 3 before it it's clearly an option for eager tech enthusiasts and early adopters but beyond that there's still a healthy selection of moto matza choose from to satisfy nearly any need now the most exciting things about the Moto Z 4 screen are the addition of an in screen fingerprint sensor and the all screen appearance it's a six point four inch 1080 by 2340 OLED display and it features all the hallmark qualities we get in just about any other recent phone like wide viewing angles sharp details and color tones that appear either oversaturated or natural depending on the display setting choose in terms of brightness it peaks at about 413 it's which can make for some difficult viewing outdoors under the gaze of the Sun the Moto Z line has always offered a mostly stock Android experience and the Moto z4 is no exception running Android 9 PI out of the box what we continue to appreciate is that the Moto experience as its packin aren't redundant or over they complicated two examples are launching the camera app by twisting the phone twice in our hand or turning on LED flash by performing a chopping motion when we think of a flagship phone what comes to mind our handsets with top-of-the-line hardware specs but the motors e4 is different it's armed with the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset coupled with four gigabytes of RAM and Adreno six awake GPU even though it's enough for fluid navigation across the interface it's not quite as capable as a Snapdragon 800 series chip when it comes to handling more intensive applications such as 3d gaming the 128 gigabytes of built-in storage is plentiful and a micro SD card slot is available for users who need more when the more discreet changes in the Moto Z 4 over its predecessor is that instead of a dual camera system the phone sports just a single camera at the back it has a 48 megapixel sensor that produces 12 megapixel photos by default all on the larger sensor the company is put into any of its phones to date it also features optical image stabilization 4k video recording a dual LED flash and this new quad pixel technology that combines 4 pixels into a larger one which theoretically should deliver better low-light performance using the same approach the 25 megapixel front-facing camera produces 6 megapixel selfies in low-light expectations are naturally high especially after Google's pixel 3 a series of smartphones but thankfully the Moto G 4 delivers better than average results for its price point not surprisingly the best results occur when there's great lighting the scene after shots taking under sunny conditions are filled with details but they're not the best in terms of dynamic range the camera simply doesn't add enough to boost the shadows so some of the compositions appear a little on the underexposed side taken indoors and a details would still be pretty good but colors would seem a bit flat under low-light the motors e4 is capable of capturing good-looking shots which you can see in some of these carnival samples under extreme conditions though and using night vision mode it results in some noticeable details loss and heavier digital noise yes the overall shot looks brighter and more exposed but the noise that infiltrates the scene doesn't make it to please clearly it's not as good as nitesite mode with the pixel three a series still it comes in handy for moderately low light situations especially when there's a presence of strong light somewhere using the same quad pixel technology found rear camera the motor z-force twenty five megapixel front-facing camera also delivers exciting snapshots it's really good at taking them on there's ample lighting around resulting in strong detailed images that aren't over sharpen and are accompanied with natural color tones then again the camera is not a strong performer under low-light video recording performance is just okay with the mode of z4 it's not a hit out of the ballpark but it's not bad either topping out at 4k resolution 30 frames per second the cameras best suited for sunny daytime settings details are sharp but dynamic range continues to be a struggle another thing worth pointing out here is the optical image stabilization which seems to apply a slight bobbing effect it's noticeable but it's not extremely distracting the weakest point about the motors ephors camera is video recording under low-light artifacting and digital noise are very rampant it doesn't help you know that the overall look is on the softer side so fine details are just about non-existent the motor support performs decently in the call quality apartment the voices have a subtle artificial quality to them through the earpiece which thankfully doesn't hinder the overall call experience aside from that there's really very little to complain about here because the earpiece and speakerphone deliver strong volume output inside the motors e4 spelled chassis is a thirty six hundred million power battery the largest in the series to date daily usage allows us to get more than ample time with the phone but more impressive is how it performs in a custom battery benchmark test it beats lasher's motors III by over an hour and even newer phones like the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus reaching a mark of nine hours and 49 minutes in our tests over the recharge aside the turbo power charger that comes included with package requires 120 minutes to get the battery pack back to full capacity that's longer than its predecessors tally but then again we're dealing with a much higher capacity battery cell there's no built-in wireless charging but you can always add later with the help of a moto mod and now comes the price the motive c4 can be fetched for $500 unlocked it's bundled with a free 360-degree camera motor mod it's a nice incentive to sweeten the package but the real treat will come to new subscribers to Verizon who can get the motor z4 for as low as $240 now we have 2 total different prices here and there's no nine of the fact that $240 is a steal now that undercuts a lot of the competition while still offering users the option to add features through the extensive lineup of moto mods but if you're planning on buying the motor z4 unlocked at $500 it's treading close to 1 plus 7 in pro territory moreover the Google pixel 3a and 3a Excel are priced below in the Moto z4 and are likely to impress you more of their camera performance we wouldn't hesitate to tell you to buy the motor z4 if you intend on having big red as your carrier it's a phenomenal deal however if you're not going to steer towards that area they'll ultimately come down to whether or not you plan to invest on add-ons for the phone either on day one or down the road with the help of those motor mods if so then absolutely consider the Moto z4 and that is it for a review guys if you wanna learn more about
