the 1 plus 7 Pro is the last major flagship to launch before the big summer smartphone break and with all new smartphones in hand we knew it was time for our ultimate camera comparison of 2019 or at least the first half of the year so let's get started and take a look at the differences with photo number 1 on this photo you can see me launched on a chair by the beach and enjoying the view perfect photo opportunity starting with the 1 plus this photo looks fine on it but you can instantly instantly see that colors look a bit pale and slightly washed out now next up the iPhone has much more vibrant and lively colors and a much more shareable look now the galaxy does a good job use the pictures from the galaxy the galaxy does a good job with a balanced look and a good exposure but the image is just not as catchy as the one from the iPhone right here and finally the pixel on the other hand under exposes the image so it looks way darker than it should so we did that some points for that and lastly the Huawei V 30 pro has some weird colors and a yellow tonality that don't look quite as good as the rest keep in mind that you can take a closer look at these images and read more

all the phones here do a decent job with slight differences so let's take a look at photo number 2 the original files starting with the image from the 1 plus now the strange thing here is the image from the samsung galaxy which is strangely flattened the default so that you can not see the contrast between the cloudy and the sunlit part right in the middle as you can see on the other picture and these are not just different conditions this is the way the picture was shot [Music] the phone does the same flattening in the next shot too which is really bizarre so let's take a look at the next shot shot number three original files and you can see once again very flat image on the Samsung and much more dynamic image on the other phones on this next shot you can also see that the pixel takes a way to dark picture it loses a lot of the detail here in the trees on the sides picture number four is full of greenery and it's a perfect illustration of how these phones render color the oneplus looks okay but again you see those washed out colors they do not catch the eye at all the iPhone does a better job here with a bit too bright of an exposure but it is the galaxy that shows all different shades of green the beautiful blue skies and it has plentiful detail so it gets the best score here now the pixel has skipped to the pixel has this image with much colder colors it's noticeably darker too and finally the Huawei p30 Pro colors just look strange is the only phone which makes the sky looks yellow and the whole image kind of looks yellowy [Music] we have one more shot let's get to shot number five [Music] and next up we jump to the low life pictures right off the bat you see that the WOM Plus captures an average photo looks a bit blurry in highlights or a bit blown out and then the iPhone well just looks too dark not a great look and definitely not an image you want to share and then the galaxy skip to the galaxy the galaxy does a good job but colors look just too saturated and definitely not realistic the pixel the pixel strikes the best balance between a good dynamic range good amount of detail and finally the Huawei exposes the person but the background appears a bit blurry and doesn't have that much detail not bad but not quite great either [Music] you see those patterns repeat and the next images the image with the buildings right here number seven [Music] next up with the bank building you can see that the pixel brings out a ton of detail and video from the shadows and it clearly looks the most impressive of the bunch [Music] now the secrets Bar photo is a photo that looks quite similar in all phones but if you look closer you'll see a few important differences and interestingly here the iPhone is able to pull out a good amount of detail and ranks close to the pixel [Music] and this last photo of our bar-hopping photo tour you can see that the WOM Plus captured the barely usable image with a lot of noise souls let's skip to the last image number 10 on the 1 + C it captures a barely usable image with a lot of noise and then the iPhone capture the pretty much useless photo that is just too dark and the galaxy was decent and it was really the it was really the Google pixel that once again impresses with its ability to capture color and light at night when no other phone could the Huawei p30 Pro here did just average nowhere nearly as good as the pixel now with all this in mind we have placed some scores based on a small jury of four photo enthusiasts that we have gathered and that have looked at all of these photos without knowing the brands to avoid any bias the big winner here is the pixel tree and that is mostly because of the excellent low-light performance that others can't quite match just yet during the day it has its own share of issues the biggest of which is that it underexposed photos and makes them darker than you'd like the galaxy s 10 plus ranks second and it performs well in all sorts of different conditions we found it to be mostly a very reliable camera with excellent colors the iPhone 10's max ranked at number three with a great showing during the day but with photos that were often barely usable at night the YP 30 Pro ranked at number four the big issue with the Huawei phone is questionable color science is practically all images from the phone have a yellow tint and this is the only phone that could never get the blue color of the sky right and finally at the last place in this comparison we have the oneplus 7 pearl with three cameras on the back this phone is versatile but if you look at the main camera what we did here you see that colors are a bit bleak and images look a bit washed out there not bad they just don't impress much of course this comparison does not look at telephoto cameras for small selfies and so much more which is that is something that you can find on our website at www.fiberlinecommunications.com let me know what you want to see us
