today we have a more unusual pick for games and you've probably already figured out what gave us the inspiration for it the five games will present you today all have something in common they are set in the world where something has gone terribly wrong and zombies and other ungodly creations are roaming the earth it's up to you to get rid of as many of them as possible let's get going with game number one zombie frontier three zombie frontier three is separated into different missions in each mission you're guided through a level until you've killed all the zombies around since aiming moving and shooting all at once with only two thumbs is inconvenient the game does the moving for you letting you focus on aiming and shooting it's important to be precise with that since your ammo is limited and running out means certain death between missions you get to upgrade your weapons or buy more powerful ones but that will cost you in-game currency of course some of it can be acquired by spending real money as usual you have to either grind it out or pay up next up we have dead trigger - dead trigger 2 is somewhat similar to zombie frontier 3 but with some significant changes here shooting is automatical you don't have to worry about that but you do get to move throughout the levels on your own this gives you the freedom to choose your approach to enemies and explore different areas looking for hidden secrets that give you bonuses as a result the game feels less mobile like which is definitely a good thing the campaign is also better fleshed out and has an interesting story to it again you have different weapons to choose from but ammo can drop from enemies you kill which lets you enjoy the gameplay more and worry less if you want to run out of bullets overall dead trigger 2 is a very well-rounded zombie shooter next up we have last day on earth survival last day on earth is a third-person RPG we should begin with literally nothing and start gaining levels and gear by roaming around looting stuff and crafting you have your own spot on the map where your bases you can expand it and enforce it any way you like to protect it from incoming zombies or even hostile players the main hurdle here is that moving from one area to another takes either a lot of time or a valuable in-game resource an interesting feature of this game is the auto button when you press it your character will automatically gather resources from the area you're in so the game basically plays for itself so once you take care of all the zombies you can let the game take care of the boring part as the name suggests you have to take care of your hunger and thirst or else things will go south rather quickly no surprise there next up we have dawn of zombie survival Dawn of zombies is quite similar to last day on earth but has a more gritty looking setting which better fits a post-apocalyptic world once again you set out to make a life for yourself by scavenging rags cutting down trees and making the most of whatever resources you can get your hands on there are a plethora of things you can do to make your experience unique customize your shelter upgrade your vehicles or even try to get a full set of armor from one of the bosses be one though if you want to get all the best items in the game you'll have to think in some serious hours into it with the current situation you might have some extra hours in your hand anyway so feel free to go at it last but not least we have zombie gunship survival zombie gunship takes survival games to another level literally it takes you to the sky because you're on board an airplane that's raining fire from above onto unsuspecting zombies the tricky part is that you're offering air support to your ground troops and keeping the hordes of zombies away from them is not as easy as it sounds as with any self-respecting zombie game you get a base of operations that you can upgrade to meet the needs of the ever harder missions you have to complete you can arm your gunship with various weapons depending on the next levels requirements but you also have to make sure your ground troops are well equipped for the job this game gives a nice twist to the zombie theme and if you're looking for something out of the ordinary it's a great choice and that's all we have for you today if you want to see more game compilations give this video a like and do not miss any of our videos by subscribing to our Channel following the here on YouTube and hitting that bell I can see you next time
