the Samsung Galaxy S 2002 comes with an unprecedented camera that allows you to zoom in further than on any other phone and it's also got a completely reimagined understand 8 megapixel main camera with a huge sensor size and I mean just look at the size of the camera array on its back but is this overhaul the camera system enough so this Samsung can win back the top spot in the camera phone game to find out we took a bunch of photos with four phones that are all competing for that privilege which one takes better pictures let's take a look in first we kick off this comparison with probably the coolest new feature on the s20 ultra and its ability to zoom in while retaining crisp clear detail but starting at the 2 x zoom level you would notice that the s 2003 is actually not as detailed is even last year's Galaxy Note and Plus that might be surprising but there is a reason for that while the note has a dedicated 2 x telephoto lens the s20 ultras periscope camera only starts working once you reach the four times to zoom level this means that the quality of zooms from 2 x right to the 4 x mark is actually not as good as it used to be on previous Samsung phones in this range the s20 ultra is just using plain lossy digital zoom and one more example shows that once again the level of detail at two times magnification is not quite as good as you have on the other contenders but once you reach that 4 times zoom level and the periscope lens kicks in you notice an immediate change in the balance of power the yes 20 ultra easily grabs the win in this round with a very clean and detailed image we do one more comparison this time at 10 times zoom and this is probably the point where the difference between the ultra and the rest is most pronounced heck the Google pixel for excel can't even zoom ten times it maxes out at 8 times magnification and would have just left it out of this round you have a similar case when you look at ten times zoom in low-light the presence of the periscope lens really makes a big difference and the s20 ultra emerges head and shoulders above the rest okay we have already proven that the 20 Ultra is in a different league when it comes to zoom capabilities but what about just using the main camera after all you have a brand new hundred and eight megapixel sensor here an impressive figure it DIF also taking pictures at 12 megapixels doll is it combines nine individual pixels into one let's call it super pixel to achieve that and the results should be a photograph with a superb quality is that really so though we like the image from the over here it has nice colors and a cheerful bright exposure but the dynamic range on the Google pixel is still superior and the other two also capture very good looking shots we really think the second image shows some of the peculiarities of the camera on ES 20 ultra notice how the image is sharp but almost too sharp it seems like the thorns on the pine trees appear almost brittle and the monument has got a bit of a halo around its edges that is due to an excessive amount of over sharpening as Samsung is applying in what we do appreciate the detail that is a bit of an overkill compare this to all other phones that have a softer but more realistic detail still we like the colors and you cannot say that damage from the ultra looks bad per se not at all but it's not quite perfect either in this next scene you'll notice the strong contrasted colors on the s20 ultra it almost seems like this photo has been shot and then already edited with added sharpness and contrast to notice this clearly when you compare it to the Galaxy Note templates which has a more neutral look to it [Music] in our next scene number four again you would see the striking difference in sharpness yes 20 ultra makes everything appear extra sharp and you easily notice it when you contrast the photo against the one taken by the note 10 plus the Google pixel for Excel here shows that it can still capture amazing images as you can see how the dynamic range and the depth of color that it has captured surpasses that from other devices and this time we'd easily pick it as the winner in this round see number five and let us ask you a question are you convinced that newer always means better it is not always the case and this scene shows it in our opinion the older Galaxy Note captures the better photo here with more lively colors and more dynamics while the image on the ultra is not bad but the contrast is overly applied and the colors don't look quite natural interestingly the pixel here captures an underexposed shot that doesn't look all that good this is a bit of a trend on the pixel that you will see sometimes another photos too in the next scene number 6 the differences between the phones are not huge but look closer and you'll notice that the Google pixel shot pulls ahead it just looks good the white balance the detail that is not overly sharpened the dynamic range the color depth it is the photo that we would pick here and let's finally jump to scene number 7 with the entrance of the restaurant and here the ultra has captured a very nice-looking photo with beautiful colors and a nice exposure the rest of the phones are also doing quite well and this scene looks pretty good on all of them but with Big D Ultra as our favorite okay we have looked at a few days shots but what about portrait mode or live focus on Samsung Galaxy devices the s20 ultra has the option to capture two times zoom portraits with the live focus mode but if use a simple digital zoom since it no longer has a two times zoom lens and the quality is decent but it's a bit of a regression compared to life focused photo captured on the two times telephoto lens of the s10 series or the note 10 plus here you can notice how half of the face of our model is overexposed and burned and the picture is no match for the quality that you get from the other three devices we were surprised with the poor quality from the pixel as well the food was just very underexposed very dark and you can see that you lose a ton of detail in those darker areas of the image it doesn't look great either and in the second portrait there is no harsh light to throw it off and yodhraj does a pretty good job and we like the strong inky colors still the Galaxy Note 10.1 the iPhone also does a very good job when it's dedicated to time zoom telephoto camera and the pixel here is the odd one with a slightly different view the view in a darker moodier exposure next up we turn to selfies where you'll notice something that is very typical for samsung phone cameras smoothening the skin it looks very silky in this shot of our model which might be an effect some people will like it does look very good in this shot the other phones you'll notice a lot less of that smoothening and those photos appear more realistic but we'd actually prefer the photo from the ultra here it might not be the most realistic one but looks good in this next selfie on the ultra you would notice that my face looks a bit blurrier than on the rest which have a much sharper cleaner detail our favorite image here is the one from the null 10 plus it exposes my face brightly has a lot of detail I mean has the best colors okay most phones these days do well during the day but what about low-light well good news is that the ultra is not afraid of the night it is able to capture a great looking photo here especially when you compare it against the note 10 plus which struggles with color and noise in those green patches of grass at the bottom part of the follow the Google pixel also captures a good photo but it can't quite match the insane amount of detail you get on the ultra good job Samsung [Music] in the next scene once again the galaxy has 20 ultra flexes its camera muscle and shows that Samsung has really improved its game tons of detail proper white balance in an excellent photo all around the iPhone while it has captured more light with the auto night mold it also makes everything appear just unknowingly hello the Google pixel strikes a good middle ground but detail in the grass is completely lost on it and finally the Galaxy Note shoots a decent photo but nowhere nearly as detailed as the ultra jump back to night scene number three and it's a close call between the s20 Ultra and the iPhone but we do give preference to the iPhone here it just has the better dynamic range and a more controlled image last but not least we included this one image to show that the ultra sometimes has its low moments too while it did exceptionally well in low-light most of the time here it bashed the photo and you notice in both the weirdly rendered neon sign in the bushes at the bottom don't have the detail and the clarity that you get on other phones all in all the galaxy s 2003 has a camera that deserves to being the conversation for the very best camera phone of 2020 is it the single very best one out there well in some cases yes especially when you zoom in more than four times but most often times in low-light it does a stellar job we do feel however that Samsung tried a bit too hard with it there's an excessive amount of sharpening that often makes objects in the photo appear too sharp and almost brittle now the iPhone once again proves that Apple is able to create a very reliable and consistent camera it does well in all sorts of conditions but we're still puzzled with that persisting yellow tint to images the Google pixel for excel often impressed us with his dynamic shots that look professional and exceeded our expectations of a phone photograph however it was not consistent and yo too often out did it in low-light which is bit surprising finally the Galaxy Note m+ proves that not everything old is necessarily worse than newer gadgets it's softer detail looks more flattering and realistic in many pictures it has a better job with selfies most of the time it's a bit behind the rest in low-light photography and can we pick a favorite not really all of those phones have their strong points and their lows but once you know them you can work around those shortcomings and enjoy snapping pictures after all that's what this is all about and this guy's wraps up our camera comparison between the s20 ultra the iPhone the pixel and the galaxy note we hope you enjoyed this little distraction from these tough times we wish you and your loved ones to be well stay healthy stay at home and we'll see you in the next one [Music]
