it's not every day that we get a phone to test and it comes in a suitcase this here is the do GS 90 it's a rugged phone it is designed to resist water damage to survive extreme cold and heat and to withstand serious drops but it is also modular what this means is that you can attach different magnetic modules to this foam and add different functions on its own the S 90 has a 5050 milliamp hour battery which is already quite substantial but using a battery module you can add another five thousand milliamp hours on top of that the phone will easily last you several days like this even though it might have a hard time filling in your pocket there is also a walkie talkie module which doesn't sound particularly exciting but the so called night-vision camera caught my attention unfortunately it's not great it is not an actual night-vision device it simply uses its own dedicated camera with higher sensitivity here's what the photo from the do GS 90 looks like and here are the same shots taken with the night vision module it is 2 megapixels in resolution and very noisy for comparison here is also a picture that I took with the Sony Xperia one that I had on me at the time ok modules aside the phone itself is thick and heavy but that's kind of expected with seriously rugged phones it has a large 6.2 inch display surrounded by a thick protective bezel I also noticed that the lip around it is slightly raised which is great it acts like a bumper to prevent scratches and damage the buttons on the side are large and easy to find there is also an additional button that you can program to launch an application of your choice or to do things like to turn on the dual flash light at the back over all the doogee s90 appears to be much more durable than any other mainstream phone but is it we decided to test its durability and see how much abuse it could take [Music] phone has a rating of IP 6 9 K which means that it is protected against high pressure high temperatures place of water sure enough dumping a bucket of water wasn't enough to cause any damage but we weren't done with the water tests yet we dropped the phone in a bucket of water for 1 hour to see what would happen an hour later the phone was still going strong not surprisingly the touchscreen didn't work while it was wet but once I wiped it it was back to working normally it was clear that we had to try harder if we wanted to do any damage to this phone I saw that on the phone's official web page it is shown being frozen in a block of ice so I decided to give it a try I put it in a plastic box and filled it with ice and water then I put it in the freezer for one hour an hour later most of the water hit frozen solid it took me some time to take the phone out of its icy prison and when I finally did it did seem to be working fine again the touchscreen was acting up because it was all wet but that wasn't surprising so far we were quite impressed by the S 90 and by how tough it was unfortunately when it came to the office on the next day I saw that the phone had died and it wasn't turning on it looked like water had somehow got inside when I opened the protective flaps for the SIM card tray there was clearly water coming out of the opening things weren't looking good for this phone some days later it came back to life but now the screen wasn't working anymore presumably because of water damage but the body of the phone was still intact so we decided to do a quick drop test the first drop was from shoulder height on the concrete tiles and I am confident that most phones wouldn't have survived without a case but the S 90 made it the phone walked away with only a small scratch in one of the corners so we decided to see how long it could last we dropped the phone from shoulder height again again again and again it survived a total of five drops without any major damage which was impressive on the sixth drop we finally managed to crack the display of the do GS 90 the phone itself seemed to be working because the screen was lighting up but the display was badly damaged at this point it would have been unusable so while the do GS 90 is not indestructible it is a lot more durable than any other popular phone we weren't impressed by its claimed water resistance but when it comes to durability this phone is seriously tough thanks for watching us destroy a phone in the name of science and subscribe to our YouTube channel to never miss any of our future videos [Music]
