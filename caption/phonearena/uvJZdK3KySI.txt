hello guys you often hear that the latest iPhones have even better cameras and you hear this every year but how good are they and how much better we took the last six generations of iPhones and took them on an epic spin for a massive camera comparison we have the iPhone 6 the 6s the 7 the 8 plus the 10s series and finally the 11pro max it's time to compare their cameras and see how they have evolved throughout the years let's get started and the first thing that we'll look at is this picture here shot during the day and you already see some massive differences to shut against the Sun you see a lot more shadows on the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6s pretty similar and on the iPhone 7 you see the image looks brighter more cheerful you have a lot bigger than Namek range starting with the iPhone 10's max which features the smart HDR option and the iPhone 11 Pro max comes with an even better picture with more detail next up let's jump to the second image here okay here we have a picture of the road and once again you see what a big difference for example here in the details you see as you cannot see anything here in much blurrier or get a much sharper picture on the iPhone 7 the iPhone 8 plus and again a much bigger dynamic range with the iPhone 10's max and the iPhone 11 Pro max we get a higher amount of detail and a more crisper and a crisper picture in this picture you have a high dynamic range scene you see the sea and on the horizon and again you can see the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6s capture very dark images a little bit Moody not that much dynamic range they don't look that good with the iPhone 7 here which have a brighter more cheerful image the iPhone 8 plus is another improvement in terms of dynamic range and then the iPhone 10s max knife only level throw max really takes things to the next level in terms of sharpness and detail jump into a picture number four again take a closer look at the colors in the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6s again darker pictures very contrasted and the iPhone 7 you have a brighter shot the iPhone 8 plus a little more detail the iPhone tennis max takes a huge jump in terms of dynamic range you can see here in the trees you have a lot more color much more pleasing picture and then the iPhone that I don't draw max takes things up to the next level you see a lot more detail on that so great job jumping to the next scene again we have the beach here a much darker photo on the iPhone 6 the 6s the iPhone 7 brighter picture but the highlights a little bit burned out and then the iPhone 10's max take the leap in terms of dynamic range the iPhone 11 Pro max even further you can see a lot more in the skies not so burn the highlights the image looks much better keeping up with the day shots again you see the iPhone 6 and the 6 s you have those dark pictures that don't look quite that good on a bigger screen iPhone 7 is an improvement you see that features a little bit of over saturation the iPhone 8 plus is the first one that we really like then the 10 s max takes a jump and there's a dynamic range you can see a lot more in the shadowy areas right here where the building is and the trees are in the iPhone 11 Pro max very similar image - 10 s max but if you look closer the detail is sharper and you have a lot more information in this photo keeping up the pace with the next image again you see the darker shots on the 6 in the 6s the iPhone 7 - 8 plus and then a bigger jump with the 10s Max and 11 for max it delivers again that higher detail and one last picture before we jump into the night photos here we have a building and the images here are not that much different but again you see here in the darker areas you just get a lot more information with the latest two generations of iPhones especially the pro max will get that added sharpness where is the bigger difference in terms of image quality of course when the light gets lower just can't this was the big issue back in the day with the iPhone 6 three or four years ago we didn't have night mold we didn't have anything so let's take a look at how the cameras have evolved throughout the years in terms of night photography and this picture is of glasses here on a bar stand and you cannot see anything on the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6s similar story the iPhone 7 you can already see a little bit the damage is very brainy don't get a lot of detail it's hard to make out what you're actually looking at the iPhone heat loss has captured a little bit of a blurry shot here maybe my hand was trembling a little bit and then with the 10s max we have that added stabilization the image is sharp you get a lot more detail and then boom the iPhone 11 pro max has that night mode for photos and you see a lot more this is actually a picture from a bar that I could share on social media one more picture that I really want you guys to see the difference here again in the same bar the iPhone 6 complete darkness you cannot see anything on this screen the iPhone 6s similar story you have to use the flash with those images and you know what happens when you turn on the flash you have these cold colors name it doesn't look good so you don't really want to use the flash but you have no other option yeah iPhone 7 slightly better but again not great the iPhone 8 plus similar to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone x max is an improvement but the bigger difference is the night mode on the iPhone the 11pro Mac wow what a game-changer night mode you get to see a lot more in the picture you don't have to use the flash it just looks good going over to the next scene you have the roll here very little detail on the iPhone 6 in the 6s and the 7 similar story the iPhone 8 plus has does some weird things with colors it looks very yellowy and unnatural than the iPhone 10s Max and the night mode on the iPhone 11 Pro max really you start to see the clouds in the skies you start to see a lot more color in the shadows it's just a much their photo you can see a huge difference between the iPhone 6 back in the day and the iPhone 11 Promax it really is that noticeable one more night photo here taken with the iPhone 6 very dark very moving not a picture you want to share i phone success same sorry iPhone 7 again same story I found 8 + you start to see some improvements and can you see problems with the white balancing which looks very yellowy not the color that you want to see and the iPhone tennis max finally captures a decent photo but notice the the lights here they look a bit blurry and then with the iPhone 11 Pro Max and night mode you see a lot more color in the shadowy areas you see that the lights are sharper and the image is overall much much better one photo I really want to show you is this sign of my hometown you can see right here it is very dark on the iPhone 6 and the 6s I want you also to pay attention to the lights here they look blurry and not really natural same thing on the 78 + you start to get a little bit of an improvement to the iPhone 10's max but notice how the sign here appears extremely dark and then boom night mode from the iPhone 11 Pro max fixes all of that one more night shot here we have a bar it's very popular around here and you can see the neon signs they look red in real life the iPhone 6 iPhone 6s iphone 7 get it completely wrong now if only it was a little bit better then you have the red color on the iPhone Denis max showing up for the first time in 2018 Apple gets colors right here and this year on the iPhone 11 Pro max you can see here in the darker areas get a little bit more more color a little bit more detail so much nicer picture and finally one last shot here of a ninth time of a nighttime scene that is not that challenging but you can see that all of the phones here did a pretty good job even the iPhone 6 and the 6s but on the 6 you see up here the areas the the highlights are burned out so don't get that much detail the 6s similar story the iPhone 7 also and for the first time on the iPhone tennis max to get that better dynamic range thanks to the smart HDR mode which really makes a big difference and then the iPhone 11 Pro max take things further with a lot more detail to the image and that's it guys a quick comparison of the cameras all the way from the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6s iphone 7 iphone 8 plus I found 10s max in 2018 and this year the iPhone 11 pro max which really feels like a huge jump especially over the 8 plus over the 7 if you're upgrading from those older phones you'll see a lot of difference in terms of smart HDR images during the day look a lot better more dynamic night mode even compared to the 10s max huge difference to get a lot more color images that you can actually work with while previously just gap you just got too dark of a photo so this guy is a quick comparison of the evolution of the modern iPhone cameras I hope you found this video interesting my name is Vic and I'll talk to you next time right here
