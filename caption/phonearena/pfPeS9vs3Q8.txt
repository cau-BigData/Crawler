the Google pixel for in the pixel for Excel are finally official after all the leaks and just as you expected they are all about pushing the boundaries in photography also radars but along with all the exciting things there are a few disappointments that you might want to know about hello guys Vic here with fallen Arena and let's take a closer look at everything good and bad about these new pixels first the new camera there are four major new changes nitesite is now better and by better we mean it's so good that you can now take photos of the Milky Way on your phone something that basically no other phone can do second it uses AI to get the white balance right in challenging conditions when even a professional DSLR would have trouble third it now features an even better super resolume features which allows you to zoom in further and portraits are better especially when your subject has crazy hair waiting around or here taking a picture of a pet and last but not least you have this super cool live hdr+ viewfinder with you exposure controls so you basically have something like Photoshop like image editing tools built in the camera second we love that this is the first pixel phone with a 90 Hertz screen the high refresh rate gives you an unmatched sense of speed and interface and in places where you don't need that high refresh rate to be turned off to help save battery power and it's also on OLED screen with excellent colors third the pixel for is the phone with the fastest secure face unlock system out there and yes the sensors on the front capture a 3d rendition of your face so you cannot just fool it with a picture and you get a level of security similar to face ID on iPhones unlike with iPhones though here the system starts working the moment it detects you are about to pick up the phone so it's much faster at number four this phone has radars no other phone offers this feature the radars are built in the top bezel on the front and Google has done the hard work to make it understand the difference between an accidental swipe and an intentional one so far the radars are only used to leave it a Pikachu wallpaper that waves back at you as well as to silence alarms and skip songs so would not call it a game-changer but it's certainly a very cool gimmick number five the Google assistant can now basically answer your requests instantly and is integrated deeply in Android and in apps this means that you can buy a movie ticket with just your voice or look up something on Twitter without ever touching your phone but as much as we love these new features there are few disappointments first and foremost to pick so foreign pixel for excel both come with much smaller batteries than all of their rivals we have not tested the phones yet but this doesn't bode well for battery life and last year's pixel three phones were no battery champions either as much as we like new technology just give us a slightly bigger phone with a good battery life Google second the base pixel formado has just 64 gigs of on-board storage which is just not enough for a powerful camera phone that you're supposed to snap thousands of pictures with and the other option is 128 gigs for $100 more a hefty price to charge for modest jump in storage at this point in time Gugu is charging you more for extra storage than Apple third Google seems to have done nothing for those who want to shoot better video on their phone this is the only flagship phone we can think of that does not support 4k 60 video recording and wonder with just 64 gigs of storage onboard 4060 will empty that storage bank even quicker our next gripe with the pixel 4 is it doesn't have an ultra wide camera which can be super useful in tight spaces and for certain landscape shots the funny thing is Google admits it did not include it and just says no we don't think that's important so you're not getting it just included next year Google thanks the fifth and most anticipated one in this list of disappointments is the lack of a headphone jack and expandable storage and we get it most new flagship phones don't have it but both those things are nice little convene for some users which are still missed and that's our quick summary of the Google pixel for series a phone with a camera that you crave and a battery life will most likely hate at least this year Google will sell the pixel for family across all major US carriers and it's also keeping the excellent pixel 3 and selling it for as low as $500 how do you feel about this new pixel for what do you love and what do you hate about it that's know in the comments hit that like button subscribe for more my name is Vic here you can find me right here on palm marina
