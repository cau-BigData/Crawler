this is the new Motorola edge one of the most affordable 5g phones out there it just seven hundred dollars it undercuts even one plus and to get to that lower price Motorola opted for the next best alternative to Snapdragon 865 and equipped it with the more cost-efficient Snapdragon 765 chip instead this is Qualcomm first integrated 5g chipset it also added a huge battery 64 megapixel camera and a headphone jack hello guys my name is Vic with fond marina and this is our review of the Motorola edge available in midnight magenta and solar black the Motorola edge looks pretty and feels solid but not to having the palm love it or leave it Motorola is going all-in with the display curves - which aid in keeping the phone narrower than the screen diagonal number suggests the six point seven inch screen is all at one and it curves sharply on both sides enhancing the aesthetics of the phone and making the swipe to go back gesture a breeze the tall 21 by 9 aspect ratio of the display makes the large phone rather comfortable to hold and operate with just one hand the rigid power lock key on the side helps you feel it without looking and overall the moto edge design while not winning any contests and originality is rather organ amak as for the screen is sufficiently bright for outdoor use but it's far from the very best and also delivers rather code looking colors with the blue and green spectrum off the mark we were kind of used to seeing amazing displays lately so we definitely expected more here now what is great about this display is that it runs at a 90 Hertz refresh rate meaning that it refreshes 90 times a second rather than 60 years most other phones and this enhances the experience it makes everything run extra smooth but if you want to maximize battery life you still have the option to switch back to 60 Hertz which gives you around 10 percent improvement in battery life one thing that is missing on the Motorola Edge is an official ip68 water protection rating the phone has quote unquote water Pelham design as Motorola calls it and it does say they were tested according to ip68 standards but without the official certificate you should always be extra careful now with the edge Motorola is also proving that if there is a will a space for both a headphone jack and a large battery can be found in 2020 and it also comes with a pair of in-ear headphones that look good and sound quite decent too the phone also comes with an official case in the box that serves as a bumper on the sides that leaves the curved display sides exposed for operation and protects everything else which is a nice touch saving you extra money and time needed to look for and choose a wrapper now the snapdragon 765 chip on this phone is a big deal this shovel-ready 5g solution supports the necessary bands for us carriers as well as international carriers 5g with the only exception being the millimeter wave range which requires bulky antennas and is not supported on this phone so what about the cameras with the edge Motorola is introducing the trendy high-res sensor with pixel bending technology providing a 64 megapixel main camera on the back of the phone that merges four physical pixels into one virtual pixel for a detailed 16 megapixel final shot you also have an ultra wide camera to capture those epic looking shots as well as a 2 x zoom telephoto camera and even the so called time-of-flight sensor that captures a depth map for portraits the ultra wide camera does double duty as a macro shooter and while not great you can get an up-close view that is not possible in most other phones so how good are the cameras oh the answer is they're fine and daylight and they produce mostly sharp and clean photos with decent dynamic range and a good amount of detail we'd like to see a bit more punch in the colors though which lead to the cold side of the spectrum and a tad more saturation for more eye pleasing looks this will be hugely appreciated the edge is also capable of 4k video recording at up to 60 frames per se and can do high-res slow-motion as well the 4k footage comes out pretty well with no visible artifacts excellent continuous autofocus speeds and great stereo sound recording just like with the still shots though colors appear on the cold side now with the edge in the edge plus Motorola introduced a new version of its Android skin called my UX now Motorola knows people aren't fans of bloated skins with apps that duplicate the functionality that Google already offers so it still keeps it simple with only a few extra features there's also custom software to make the most of that curved edge display because the menus you can pull from the side in-game triggers battery indicators and notification lights are all part of the edge experience the good things about the new my UX Edition however and here wow you can now choose your own themes that the full settings look like we're back in Android Gingerbread days everything looks very basic and to top it off the phone comes with a great selection of exactly one wallpaper but it's a good-looking one in addition for a light stock Android overlay my UX bombards you with annoying warnings and tutorials from the get-go no matter if you fire the camera app the settings or try to set the trigger buttons for games we also must add the haptic feedback to our general list of complaints the vibration motor on this phone is too weak and be prepared for the phone to keep shaking loud and long with every notification which is quite annoying now as much as we complain about these nuances though we have to say that Motorola did a great job on battery life the edge comes with a 4500 milliamp hour battery that will last the average user up to two days of the charger and the phone lasted especially long while streaming videos online we can check out the full results of the Motorola edge battery test over at our web site at www.movinon.com you can find the link in the description now charging with the 18 watt charger that's provided in the box however is nowhere nearly as fast as you get on c-- oneplus phones and the food charge takes more than two hours on the Motorola edge so there you have it the Motorola edge a $700 phone that gives you 5g connectivity extra long battery life and the different curved screen design but it compromises a bit on display quality it comes with a dated Android interface and a camera that is just average if you're considering this phone don't hesitate to also check out our one plus eight review as that phone might be the better deal at the same price and if you're using the moto edge let me know how do you like it in the comments drop a like if you enjoyed watching this subscribe to our Channel phone arena for more
