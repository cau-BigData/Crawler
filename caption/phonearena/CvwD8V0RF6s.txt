which iPhone has the best battery life we have been testing all the latest iPhones over the past two weeks double and triple checking the results and now it's time to unveil the results hello Internet Vic here and it's time to test battery life the phone arena way we will be doing three separate tests first we will be testing browsing then we'll be playing YouTube videos and next we'll do some 3d gaming at the end we'll have a separate score for each of those categories and we'll look at a total score for each phone to see who is the winner and what are the differences laying on the table we have the seven iPhones that we'll be testing today ordered from the oldest to the newest ones and you can see how Apple has gradually increased battery sizes and the iPhone 11 series finally have beefy batteries it should give them a noticeable advantage for the browsing test we have a set of web pages that are refreshing at the same pace on all the phones and the phones are also running a script that Scrolls the pages up and down to simulate the way you use the phone in real life since running this test takes a very long time we'll show you what the test looks like in the actual results but we won't guide you through the full test in real time we should also tell you an important detail before we start this test we set the brightness on the screen at the same level using specialized equipment we set the brightness at 200 nets a level that is about the average for comfortable indoor use this is hugely important because screen brightness is one of the biggest factors for battery life and having different actual brightness on devices could affect their battery life significantly and 7 hours and 49 minutes into the test the first iPhone to die is the iPhone 10 s it has the smallest battery among all and it shows here we need to wait 40 minutes more until the next phone dies that is the iPhone 10 s max which finishes with a score of 8 hours in 32 minutes soon after the iPhone 11 pro has its battery depleted as well at 8 hours and 41 minutes the rest of the phones still have some juice left we need to wait for an additional hour so until the next one dies and that is the oldest iPhone the iPhone 8 plus with a score of nearly 10 hours the rest of the iPhones all reach the 11 hour mark the iPhone 10 our dies at 11 hours and 8 minutes and that was not a surprise the tenor was advertised as the iPhone with longest lasting battery last year soon after it comes the newer iPhone 11 which finishes the test with a score of 11 hours in 25 minutes the last phone this too keeps on going here is the iPhone 11 pro max it has a beefy battery of nearly 4,000 milliamp hours the largest ever on an iPhone and it manages to score an impressive 12 hours in 53 minutes on our browsing tests and win it with a big advantage notice that battery testing is a notoriously hard thing is practically impossible to get perfect results down to the minute and that is why we are running tests a couple of times and there might be small differences between runs which we usually approximate next up we line up the iPhones were probably the most important test YouTube video playback YouTube is probably my most used application and we're sure is the same for many of you so this test will give you a very good idea about how long your phone will last for YouTube playback again we'll fast forward the sequence and only show you the final results since this test takes so long and we run it at least a couple of times to ensure the results are correct in the first phone to die in this test is again the iPhone 10s the 10s scores just 4 hours and 52 minutes of YouTube video playback a really disappointing result not long after the iPhone 8 plus bites the dust' at 5 hours and 23 minutes in just 2 minutes after it the iPhone 10's max goes down the iPhone 10 hour which lasted quite a while for browsing that is much quicker when you watch videos on it and it is next in line the score of 5 hours and 15 minutes all the other iPhones in this test keep on going for quite a while the new iPhone 11 pro does much better than its predecessor the tennis with a final result of 6 hours and 20 seven minutes the iPhone 11 goes the extra mile and finishes with a result of seven hours and 13 minutes finally the only phone that is still going strong here is the iPhone 11 pro max it lasts nearly nine hours an absolute record holder amongst iPhones congratulations to Apple for hugely improving YouTube video playback which was iPhones weakside for years and now it's at least decent on its newest devices third we look at 3d gaming this test will show you the average time you should expect your phone to last when you're playing games like fortnight asphalt color duty minecraft or the like these are some of the most popular games out there and they take the phones to their maximum performance using both the CPU and the GPU so you can see those beautiful graphics this is the most intense of our tests but it still takes at least a few hours so the video you're seeing here is a simulation and not the actual test we have run the actual test a couple of times to ensure the results are correct and consistent the first phone that dies on this test is the iPhone 8 plus which lasts just three hours and 29 minutes which basically means that an hour of gaming please nearly 30% of your battery next the iPhone 10s the iPhone 10's Macs in the iPhone 11 all die at about the same time with just three hours and 38 minutes on the clock the iPhone 11 pro is next in line with a score of 3 hours and 48 minutes wait a few more minutes and the iPhone 10 are also bites the dust' at 4 hours in 5 minutes at this point in time only the iPhone 11 pro max remains and it lasts quite a bit more than the rest and finishes the test with a score of 5 hours and 15 minutes iPhones consistently score highest in terms of graphics performance and we have noticed that games look usually better on them with more detail but this also takes a toll on battery life and compared to many Android phones the iPhones lack battery endurance for gaming I guess that's why so many people still carry power banks with with all three tests done let's take a look at the overall scores first we have the browsing test result second the YouTube video playback test and third the 3d gaming test what we do next is come up with a total score we calculated by using the following ratio two parts browsing two parts YouTube video in one part gaming the last gaming test doesn't have equal significance since gaming is traditionally something that people do less often on average and starting with the worst performer here is the iPhone 10s last year's small iPhone has a total score of 5 hours and 48 minutes while the average for all phones that we have tested is around 7 hours so it falls noticeably behind second worst is the iPhone 10s max with a total score of 6 hours and 19 minutes then come the iPhone 11 Pro an iPhone 8 plus and finally the three best performing iPhones are at number three the iPhone 10 are number two the iPhone 11 and at number one pulling far ahead of the rest the iPhone 11 pro max with a total score of nine hours and 48 minutes the most expensive new iPhone is also the best battery performer and to fight for the title of the longest lasting phone of the year we'll be doing that and other tests in the near future but at the moment we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the performance of these iPhones what are your impressions about battery life are you happy now that iPhones are slightly thicker but have a much better battery life let us know in the comments match the like button subscribe for more videos my name is Vic this is fall arena and hope to see you again soon
