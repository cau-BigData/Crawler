fossil in its army of brands are launching a bunch of new SmartWatch models this year and if we have new models from Emporio Armani we have Michael Kors diesel and Puma and all of these smartwatches with the exception of the Puma to an extent are running on fossils Gen 5 configuration and now that basically means their Android wear smartwatches and they have a bunch of new additions to the configuration so let me tell you what those are they have built-in speaker they have smart battery modes they have increased storage that means around 8 gigabytes of free memory for most of those except for the Puma which has more internal storage they have NFC enabled payments they have swim proof so you can swim with those and they have heart rate tracking and many many more features so the micro course access Mart watch comes in two distinct variants first one is the go which is more basic sporty-er type of SmartWatch it's very colourful has rubber bands comes in around $290 something around that the other designs are way classier and dressier they're made of metal and combine different colors like you have silver watch there's a gold watch a rose gold and guys most of these are unisex however there is one which is more of a feminine SmartWatch which has some added bling bling to it in these watches being so much snazzier are also more expensive they come in at 350 dollars next up we have the diesel watches it's actually one SmartWatch the on axial but it comes in a bunch of different color variations all of which look very cool if you ask me the straps are rad there's a denim one there's leather there's metal one and all of those look very cool to think about these these are watches they're very rough masculine looking big so if you're into that kind of look basically like masculine guy like I am now these watches you're gonna find pretty cool terms of software there's a unique feature by these over here called information dunno guys if you're serious about your style first thing you got to do is you you got to replace that homescreen with something you know more traditional but other than that these are watches come in at the same price as the micro corresponds at 350 the Emporio Armani SmartWatch is part of their connected lineup it's called the SmartWatch 3 it's more basic simpler looking watch has a very lightweight aluminum body it comes in silver and black but also in some very interesting colors other than that is again identify SmartWatch as Android wear has Snapdragon wear 3180 gigs of storage it's pretty cool the good thing about it is a bit cheaper it comes in at 275 and finally we have the Puma it's one model a bunch of different colors very basic almost this interesting kind of design costs 275 again lounge is a bit later in the year in November unfortunately all of the models that we so weren't really functioning so but you know it's just basic Android wear stuff with a custom home screen design and that's pretty much it the thing about it it's more of a like Gen 4 point 5 SmartWatch so it has less storage inside and some of the other features are not present other than that just the basic you know some sports looking SmartWatch now a few words about all these smartwatches the designs themselves pretty good the hardware is good the thing is the software platform they are running Android wear or where OS by Google at that point feels pretty dated at least to me if it's not outright dead out it's very very stale for about the same price you can get a Samsung Galaxy watch active 2 which is a great watch that can act both as a sports watch and is a dress watch and samsung's Smart Watch OS which is based on Tizen is just miles ahead of whereas it's smooth its polished it's fun it just feels looks and feels like a healthy software platform so that's it guys new watches by for sale poor erm any visa Michael Kors and Puma let us know how you feel about them in the comments down below and I'll see you guys next time [Music]
