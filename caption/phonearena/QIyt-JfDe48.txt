is the zoom on the galaxy s 20 as good as the zoom on the galaxy s 20 ultra with all-new galaxy s 20 falls in our hands it's time for the ultimate zoom comparison that will show you whether getting the s 20 ultra for its super zoom capabilities is actually worth it over just getting the s 20 or the s 20 plus hello guys Vic with Phone arena here and the s 20 ultra impresses with a space zoom camera it features the folded periscope lens with a native 4 times optical zoom but it performs incredibly well also at 10 times and more thanks to Samsung's hybrid optical zoom technology it combines input from the periscope camera and the main camera Putra can even go as far as 100 times zoom but keep in mind that everything further than the 10 times zoom appears to be good old digital zoom where you lose a bit in terms of quality in detail now the galaxy s 20 and the s 20 plus on the other hand lack the periscope camera and they don't even have a telephoto camera at all the two phones use a sixty-four megapixel secondary camera Samsung itself admits that it actually sports a lens that is very much wide-angle almost is wide as the lens on the main camera the telephoto lens here only provides as 1.06 times zoom it's almost nothing compared to the regular camera so all the zooming is actually almost entirely based on software is this really bad bad when compared to the s20 ultra we have shot images at 30 times 10 times 4 times in two times zoom as well as the regular 1 times main photo with the main camera here are the results starting with the maximum zoom level on the s 20 and the s 20 plus 30 times zoom you can see that just as you'd expect the cameras on the s 20 and the s 20 plus phones are basically the same where you do see a huge difference is in comparison to the s 20 ultra which looks much cleaner and which has a lot less noise this is especially noticeable on the straight piece of hair that looks beautifully sharp and clear on the ultra and very noisy on the other tool in this next scene our own Peter K modeled for this shot and you can see that his face looks clean even at 30 times zoom well the same zoom level on the s 20 produces an image that is very noisy and it doesn't look as good finally we also zoomed in on some text far far away this is a good moment to mention that all these shots are taken without any tripods or Gamble's we're just holding the phones in our hand and shooting my hand has obviously trembled a bit on the s20 shot and you can see that it looks slightly blurrier than the s 20 plus but both are quite noisy when compared to the s 20 ultra so far at 30 times zoom the ultra outperforms the other two strongly next up we look at the image at 10 times zoom Samsung advertises that at 10 times you get hybrid optical zoom which still looks great and indeed it does the shots from the s 20 series are quite noisy and don't look nearly as good peter volunteered to set it out in the cold and he looks rather unhappy but I do hope the results were worth it once again this image proves that the Ultra is far superior in both the detail and the overall appeal of the image the difference at 10 times zoom is nowhere nearly as pronounced as it was at 30 times but it's still there next up we go to 4 times zoom level the native optic zoom for the s20 ultra you're framing would probably be different if you shoot at 4 times zoom as you would have a lot more subject than the frame for the sake of this comparison we stood still and didn't change our position and the framing so you can still notice the cleaner photo from the ultra which beats the other 2 handily look up close in this second scene and you see tons of noise on the photo from the s20 series while the s20 ultra remains crispy clean the Ultra is truly the most advanced phone when it comes to zoom in far and away interestingly none of the s20 phones have a 2 x telephoto zoom camera like the s10 series used to this means that quality at 2 times zoom level is actually worse than last year's galaxies but back to this comparison there are no huge differences it does at this zoom level between the phones the advantages of the ultra are only apparent after you zoom in at least four times one more shot to prove this and again we see no major differences between the phones at two times the zoom level and finally this is how this image looks with the main camera no zoom remember that first image three times zoom take a look at this image compared to the 30 times zoom magnification to appreciate the incredible amount of zoom range all these phones provide truly mind-boggling and this is also a good image to check if there are any major differences in image quality between the hundred and eight megapixel sensor on the s20 ultra in the 12 megapixel sensor on the s 20 and the s 20 plus the answer in our opinion is no not really it seems that colors in detail all look very comparable unless you really start pixel peeping one more shot to compare the main camera on the s20 ultra against the main cameras on the s 20 plus and we do notice a bit more dynamics on the s 20 ultra which reveals the blue color in the skies while the other phones don't quite cope with that task but apart from that one detail the images are very similar so we started with a question and that question was whether the zoom on the galaxy s 20 ultra is vastly better than the zoom on the S 20 and the s 20 plus in our opinion the answer is unequivocal yes images from the autre looked much cleaner from four times zoom to 30 times zoom and beyond and if you want to capture that special moment of your kid's first baseball game or a concert Cal cs20 ultra is the way to go yes 20 and yes 20 plus can still capture a great looking image especially compared to other phones but not quite the extent that the s 20 ultra can and the difference is noticeable so this is guys this wraps up our to zoom comparison between the s 20 ultra and the regular s 20 and s 20 plus let me know what you think about the differences could you see them on your screen and which one are you getting are you getting any of these phones let me know in the comments my name is Vic you're watching phone arena subscribe if you want to see more and I will see you in the next one [Music]
