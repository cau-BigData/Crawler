if you guys are tired of the $1000 price smartphones we're getting nowadays they're gonna be real ecstatic to know what Google has in store with its brand-new pixels thanks to the pricing they're far more obtainable by a lot of people hey guys it's John Vee here with phone Reena and this is a review of the Google pixel three a and three Axl the pixel 380 line for the most part embody the design language we've seen previously with the pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL obviously the most apparent change is the plastic bodies they boast which makes perfect sense in classifying them as mid Rangers the two-tone finishes continue to make them distinctively pixels but even with their polycarbonate builds they still look and feel incredibly solid what's rather odd though is that Google offer to bring back the headphone jack with these phones but hey we don't mind them at all they also feature a dual speaker system on the bottom edge combined with the one from the earpiece to deliver stereo output and lastly it's worth pointing out that neither phone offers any sort of water resistance or wireless charging which shouldn't come as a shock because these features are typically reserved for higher-end devices the pixel 3 comes with a 5.6 inch 1080 by 22 20 AMOLED display while the pixel 3 axl maximizes things with a 6 inch 1080 by 2160 AMOLED panel both displays have almost identical resolution meaning that the XL model has a slightly lower pixel density but that's not a big deal in our opinion they still boast all the local aspects of any good OLED panel like their wide viewing angles deep blacks and punchy colors and even though they're not quite as iridescent as the Super AMOLED in Samsung's flagship s-- they still deliver some appealing qualities the pixel 3/8 XL reaches 416 Nets which is lower than the majority of phones put out in the last few months so it can't be problematic trying to use outdoors in the gaze of the Sun and being mid Rangers were not too perturbed by the bezels around the displays uniformity that's the fundamental strategy at the heart of experience with Google's pixel line there's no difference in what we see and get with the new pixel 3 a series versus the flagship pixel 3 line they're running stock 9pi so they feature all the trimmings we've come to expect and love about the platform we also get features like Google assistance called screen feature as well as active edge that summons up Google system in an instance when squeezed on the sides of the phone but above all it's the fact that these are mid Ranger's much like their flagship counterparts they'll be among the first phones to get the next iterative update for Android and the wait for that typically isn't long at all on the outside it's quickly perceptible that these are lured to their devices due to their polycarbonate frames but it's also evident when looking at what's on the inside these new pixels are powered by qualcomm snapdragon 670 chip and coupled with four gigabytes of RAM generally speaking they're responsive just like any other device in the pixel line now the only downside to them is that they're not great for gaming so if you're a hardcore gamer they're not gonna be suitable because the frame rates are slower and they're a bit more choppy another major thing worth mulling over when making a buying decision is that these new pixels are offered in one single storage capacity that's 64 gigabytes with no expansion at their disposal it means that you're really going to need to rely on Google's cloud services to ensure unnecessary content isn't taking up space locally you think that a mid-range phone would be given a less formal camera or if you're to look at the specs of both phones you may be intrigued by the reality that they're identical to the flagship pixels we're talking about a single 12.2 megapixel camera paired with an F 1.8 lens and around the front of both phones we have an 8 megapixel camera with an F 2.0 lens but it's not the dual cameras of the pixel 3 Series the only qualms we have with the experience of taking snapshots with these new pixels is the image processing delay you get when you start shooting photos in succession now that's a compromise we'll gladly accept given the excellent overall performance out of their cameras there's no shortage of details or punch of link colors under ideal lighting saturation maybe a bit aggressive under artificial lighting but the end result still reels us in even low-light situations don't face these cameras they produce nicely lit compositions in an otherwise dark scene Nightside brings out some of these details by boosting the shadow but it's nice to see that the details in the shots aren't softened to a larger degree we're even impressed by how Nightside can bring out the colors to take for instance the red colored bench and green grass behind it in one this photos we snap in a standard shot you can barely see the colors but Nightside bumps up exposure while also adding a bit of saturation to enhance the overall look we're fans on the front facing cameras too when the lighting is good selfies are accompanied by good details with a little bit of sharpening applied add to that some punchy looking color tones and what we get here with these new pixels our selfies we're taking over and over again in low-light situations they're underexposed but nice I can come to the rescue by increasing the exposure and adding some much-needed color tones now equally impressive is the video recording performance it tops out at 4k 3840 by 2160 pixels and these new phones continue to show us they're full of surprises similar to theirs still sharp performance videos are presented in glory with their rich details and accurate colors more poorly though there is an option in the settings for video stabilization that's move-ins out the footage to give that walking on air look that there's one sore spot in their performance it has to be with low-light video capture it's just not that great in extreme low-light conditions you definitely see a lot of noise in the shots especially in the shadows so it just gives everything a softer look being mid Ranger's its company to know that these pixels don't have too many compromises when it comes to making phone calls for the most part voices sound fine through the earpiece while the speakerphone is pretty clear and strong our callers were also able to discern our voices on their end with minimal distortion too if you want the longer battery life stick with the pixel three Axl obviously that's because it's 3700 milliamp hour battery is simply a beast lasting well over a day of normal usage it's a top contender in our battery benchmark test to nearly lasting 11 hours of continuous on-screen time in comparison the galaxy s 10 plus tapped out at eight hours additionally these pixels have some of the fastest clock times for recharging with the pixel three Axl is able to get back to full capacity after 99 minutes of charging that's super fast and it all happens using the included charger so we're not too bummed by the fact that wireless charging isn't here Google has delivered superb mid-range phones looking at the overall picture we can Adamle say that the only area where they scaled back is in their performance as the snapdragon 670 is a notable step down from the snapdragon 845 other than that we don't think that the plastic designs are bad with starting prices of $400 and 484 - pixel 3a and pixel 3a excel respectively they show to all of us that you don't need to spend a fortune to get a great phone experience excelled all the important areas like taking photos offering long battery life and flawed responses navigating around the software the pixel 3a and 3a Excel are not here to replace our beloved 800 to 1000 dollar price flagships they are not even competitors to the oneplus phones but they are indeed great options if you're on the lookout for a more affordable smartphone with a great camera performance and clean Android and that is it for our review if you guys want to learn more about either the Google pixel 3a or the 3a Excel you can check
