this is the new Motorola RAZR a foldable phone that you can flip to close with a satisfying snap and one that fuse have the size of modern smartphones but most importantly this phone placed on your nostalgic feelings it's been nearly 15 years and only few phones have touched the same legendary status of the original razor and this new one does everything it can to remind us of those times first things first though let's talk about the folding and death screen Motorola partnered with Lenovo for the development of a unique hinge mechanism what's most interesting here is the fact that this display folds within the Motorola RAZR and it folds flat no space left for debris to enter and scratch the delicate plastic screen opening it however is not quite as easy as it used to be 15 years ago on the original RAZR well the new Motorola RAZR can technically be open with the flick of your thumb the heavier spring mechanism makes it a bit harder and definitely increases the risk of dropping the phone accidentally you'd be better off using both your hands to open it most of the time when folded the Motorola RAZR is so compact that it's almost surreal we had to double check our pockets just to make sure the phone was indeed there and we can definitely get used to not carrying a giant device the first thing that you notice when you take the razor in your hands is of course the small 2.7 inch external screen well it's so easy to get as much with fingerprints it's also surprisingly useful aside from telling the time and showing you incoming notifications it could be used to interact with any app or feature on the phone and if you feel tight on space you can unfold the razor and continue from right where you left off on the main screen at the back of the razor we have that neat dotted pattern that feels great in the hands then as a reassuring grip and even this design aspect of the phone feels nostalgic the chin at the bottom however is an acquired taste the main reason why the Motorola RAZR has such a large chin is you you guessed it to play with the nostalgia factor but I have to admit that it doesn't feel out of place on this phone at all and it helps with the grip and once you pop the lid open you're greeted by the 6.2 inch main display it's an oled one which looks and most importantly feels great when open it gets almost perfectly flat and you cannot feel much of a crease in the middle on the software front we've got a Motorola 5 version of Android 9 pi there's absolutely nothing groundbreaking here you have the Moto gestures in the familiar Android look but you should know about one trick this phone has one of the coolest Easter eggs ever a built-in full interface retro theme that immediately throws you back at least a decade the lower part of the screen turns into the good old moto keyboard or the upper part simulates the rudimentary low res screen of the original razor you can use t9 tech simple tap the virtual d-pad to get around the interface and even check your texts it's not something that you ever use in real life maybe except to prank your friends but it's just so cool and we love it in terms of cameras moto makes full use of the foldable design and you can use the main camera to take selfies there's also dedicated selfie camera built-in the notch on the main screen but you're better off using the main camera for its superior image quality overall however image quality is not quite comparable to the very best phones out there like the latest iPhones the Google pixels the galaxies these are our first impressions stay tuned for the review this new moto razor is all about nostalgia and you really shouldn't just judge it by the spec sheet but who are still kind of disappointed to see mid-range specs on the phone that costs $1500 it lacks a flagship chip but from our brief time with the phone to actually felt very capable and quite snappy the only real concern one might have here is the battery life well the company promises a full day of battery endurance heavier use might drain it even faster finally we should say that yes at $1,500 the Motorola RAZR is definitely way too expensive you can look at this from value-for-money perspective and it's absolutely not worth it but for the nostalgic ones the dreamers who proof of concept that sets the stage for something much bigger for Motorola's future it's also foldable phone done right showing that foldable phones don't need to be those QWERTY monstrosities that look so unnatural and unwieldy the razor is working its own way one that makes it hard to fold it for anything put shortly this is the most awesome terrible phone that we have used if that makes any sense and this wraps up our first look at the new razor what do you think about it would you be willing to spend extra to get this one drop us a comment hit that like button subscribe to see more from us my name is Vic this is fall arena I'll see you in the next one
