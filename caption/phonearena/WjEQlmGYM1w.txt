this year Samsung has come back with a completely reimagined idea about its affordable phones the J Series are gone and replaced by a brand new a series hello guys my name is Victor stuff with phone arena and we have two of these new a series on hand for a review the galaxy a 50 and the galaxy a 30 well these two differ noticeably in price they share the same screen size the same battery size and the same interface so we decided it would make much more sense to review them in one place mentioning the differences along the way so let's get started both the galaxy 850 and the galaxy 830 look well-made and elegant they are thin they feature a slightly curved back and you have a minimal bezel around the screen the back of the phones also reflects light and transforms with it in all sorts of interesting patterns having further style points look closer though and you will notice that the back of these two phones is not glass as it appears from afar but this instead plastic we were extremely careful handling these phones yet despite all the care the galaxy 50 that we use without the case quickly gathered a few scratches so we're not sure how well these phones will aged two features worth mentioning are the presence of the good old headphone jack so you don't need any clunky dongles and the lack of any form of special water protection unfortunately now if we had to pick just one favorite feature in Samsung phones this would without a doubt be the screen and the galaxy 50 and galaxy 30 both come with excellent displays both have the same 6.4 inch 1080 by 23 40 pixel Super AMOLED display protected with Gorilla Glass 3 these screens are an absolute joy they're sharp they come with rich vibrant colors they get plenty bright and they just look good significantly better than the screens on other rivals one of the major differences between the a 50 and the a 30 is the fingerprint scanner now the a 50 has a fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen while the a 30 features traditional fingerprint reader on the back so the 850 should be better right well not really the optical in screen fingerprint feels like a bit of a disappointment it often fails to get a proper read and you need to try unlocking the phone a couple of times before it finally works on the a 30 on the other hand the traditional fingerprint scanner is fast and works reliably and accurately every time in terms of interface both phones are powered by Samsung's latest one UI based on top of Android 9pi this is the same software yet on the galaxy s 10 series and it's the best version of TouchWiz so far it feels less cluttered a lot of things are optimized for easier one hand reach and you have a few useful new features like a dark mode for night use you also get the option to switch to the gesture based navigation that can replace a traditional three button Android nav which is nice now both the a 50 and the a 30 are powered by octa-core Samsung made Exiles chips but different ones and there is a tangible difference in actual performance now the big takeaway here is that neither of these two phones feels very fast or smooth but the 830 specifically often feels a bit sluggish now you commonly see drop frames animations are not as smooth as on many other phones and so on that's the issue first this is one of the major downsides of affordable Samsung phones in general these are no exception there is one more big difference between these two phones and it's in the amount of onboard storage we have a generous 128 gigs the foamboard storage on the a 50 while the a 30 has half that at 64 gigs of storage both phones also support microSD cards for memory expansion should you need more storage in the future let's get this out of the way while technically you get a triple camera on the a 50 and a dual camera on the a 30 there's not a huge difference in terms of actual camera performance between these phones and that extra camera on the a 50 is a depth sensor this is only used for portrait mode shot during the day follows have pleasing colors on both phones the differences between the a 50 and a 30 mostly ball down to the amount of detail where the a 50 has the upper hand the ultra wide-angle camera on both phones is a useful addition during the day as it allows you to capture some interesting perspectives in low-light neither one is great but the a 50 captures sharper photos while the e30 photos look mediocre as to the ultra wide camera at night you'd be better off not using it at all on both phones the photo quality really is not good enough on the video side video recordings max out at 1080p at 30fps but the bigger limitation on both phones is that you can not switch between the two cameras so once it starts recording with the main camera for instance you cannot switch to the ultra wide one Midway the lack of 4k video is also a bit strange especially on the pricier 850 model on both the a 50 and the e30 you get a single button firing loudspeaker the a 50 is a slightly louder one but the sound on both lacks any form of depth and is very very tinny piercing the years as you listen again we don't have sky-high expectations but sound quality via the last speaker was still a bit of a disappointment on a more positive note we did not have much of an issue with the incall speaker in these phones the earpiece is located right above the front camera and you get a sufficient amount of volume and a decent amount of clarity during calls the best thing about the a 50 and the a 30 however might just be their battery life both come with equally sized 4,000 milliamp hour batteries and they both last a long time the two scored great on our proprietary battery test which results close to the 11 hour mark longer than most lectures by a good margin and in real life this should translate to close to 2 days of use on average we also have supports for quick charging onboard and the charges that come in the box with both phones output a maximum of 15 watts and takes around an hour and 40 minutes to recharge the phones just as you'd expect in 2019 both new a series come with a USB C port but there is no wireless charging support so let's sum things up the new a 50 and a 30 are basically the same phone with the same screen same battery life same reliable Samsung experience but with slight differences mostly in cameras and performance power the galaxy 850 costs around $300 and the galaxy a 30 is sold for 230 and both phones are available unlocked at retailers like bmh is it worth paying the extra money for the a 50 considering that the differences from the a 30 are not that huge yes if you care about gaming and performance but for everyone else we're not convinced you should spend the extra cash for the very slight upgrades that you get and this runs up our review of the new galaxy 850 and the a 30 thank you so much for watching this thumbs up if you liked it subscribe for more my name
