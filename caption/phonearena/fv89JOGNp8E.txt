the iPhone alone Promax and the Samsung Galaxy Note templates are two of the best flagship phones around and both being large phones they also come with big batteries inside the 11pro max has nearly 4,000 milliamp hour battery the biggest one ever put on an iPhone while the Galaxy Note templates features an even larger 43 hundred million power cell so you might be wondering which of these two lasts longer let's start with the browsing test where we have Safari on the iPhone and the Chrome browser and the note and we're refreshing the same set of web pages and scrolling up and down to simulate real world use we start at 100% and measure the time it takes to drain the battery completely while browsing what you're seeing now is a simulation of the test and not the actual runs for the simple reason that those tests take so long to complete and we're running them a couple of times to ensure the results are correct keep in mind that the displays on both phones are set at the same level 200 Nets of brightness both phones are among the longest lasting on the market but the first one to die here is the Galaxy Note templates at 11 hours and 37 minutes this is a remarkable result but the iPhone 11 pro max keeps on going even further until it reaches a 12 hour in 53 minute mark this is a difference of nearly an hour and a half or more than 10% next let's continue to probably the most important test of them all YouTube video streaming watching videos is something I personally do so much and I was extremely curious to see which phone will give me better battery life for this again we measure the time it takes to fully drain the battery and for this we're using the same playlist of videos running in the same order you will see a simulation of the test and not the actual run is again this test takes a long time and we're running it a couple of times to ensure the results are right and again the note 10 plus is the first one to die here with the score of the quite excellent eight hours and two minutes of continuous YouTube playback but the iPhone goes even further and finishes this test with a final score of eight hours in 58 minutes so you can expect to watch an hour more video on the iPhone than on the note previously Samsung phones have always beaten Apple in this regard so we're glad to see that the iPhone 11 Promax finally catches up and even wins this round finally we're also running a 3d gaming test on both phones and if you played games like fortnight or asphalt on your phone this test will tell you how long you can expect the battery to last what we will show you here is a simulation and not the actual game we're using to test and again fast-forward this and the Galaxy Note m+ is the first to bite the dust at 5 hours and 5 minutes is this is the most demanding of the three tests the iPhone dies soon after at 5 hours and 15 minutes both all's get quite warm during this test but really the results between the two are not that much different in terms of the actual time so after running all of these tests let's take a look at the final score we calculate this using two parts browsing two parts YouTube and one part gaming as most people don't play games as much as they watch videos or use the web and the iPhone 11 pro max wins this contest with a total use time of 9 hours and 48 minutes compared to 8 hours and 53 minutes on the note 10 Plus meaning that on average you can expect to get nearly a full hour more of battery life on Apple's big phone than on the note good job Apple but we're not done just yet after draining the batteries multiple times we now also test charging speeds and this one is interesting because this is the first iPhone to finally come with the fast charger in the box you have an 18 watt fast charger for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and a 25 watt fast charger for the note 10 plus 15 minutes into this test we have our first check point and the pro max already has 24% on the battery meter while the note pulls ahead at 31% next up we check the phone's 30 minutes after we started charging them to find that the iPhone has 48 percent on the battery meter while the note already has 63 percent that faster charging clearly makes a difference for those short top ups 45 minutes into the test the note battery is recharged to 86 percent while the iPhone has fallen further behind at 67% 8 about this time the charging rate on phones drops to prevent the battery from degradation but still one hour into the test the note is almost completely charged at 98% while the iPhone is at 82 percent the note gets to a full charge in exactly one hour and four minutes while the iPhone will slow down dramatically towards the end and that is an amazing showing by Samsung of whom recharge in slightly more than an hour keep in mind that if you're using your phone while charging you get much slower speeds though with this in mind which I can at 1 hour and a half and the iPhone still hasn't finished as it has 94% charge and we need to wait for more than 2 hours for it to charge completely the iPhone 11 pro max arrives at the full 100% at 2 hours and 8 minutes and when you look at the final numbers the difference is quite dramatic but if you don't insist on getting a full 100% charge you can get to about 80% on both phones in less than an hour which is actually quite good still it is the note that clearly wins this charging test and it can charge even faster with the 45 watt adapter that Samsung is selling separately for around 40 bucks we're not sure about those super fast chargers and their effect on long-term battery health so we do have our concerns but if you're after speed you will love them let us know are you interested in the Stace ting this charger separately and this runs up our experience draining and charging the iPhone 11 pro max in the samsung galaxy note templates these are clearly two of the best phones of 2019 and probably 20/20 great cameras beautiful displays powerful performance and a bunch of other features the iPhone wins the battery life contest while the note has the faster charging let us know your experience with whichever one you're using in the comments below don't forget that battery life is a little Toria Slee difficult thing to measure since everyone uses their phone in a different way and the numbers you see are the results of multiple tests that took a long time so thumbs up would definitely be appreciated don't forget to subscribe to stay in the loop with the latest in tech my name is Vic and I'll talk to you
