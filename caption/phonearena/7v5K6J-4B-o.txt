if you don't like the way the air pods look and feeling in here then you may like this next pair we're going to talk about hey guys it's John be here wait phone ring and this is a review of the beats power beats Pro unlike the air pods the power beats Pro were designed for individuals with a more active lifestyle that's because they're designed to stay on snuggling your ear even during intense activities thanks to the ear hooks of course they're not necessarily the most discreet looking things but that's not the intention the design here instead there's a sporty edge to their style and we like that even with an intense 1 hour workout session at the gym they managed to stay in place there are also sensors in each one of them to detect whether they're worn or not so they'll automatically pause when taken off and then continue track when put back on again if there's one thing we're not totally stoked about here it has to be the battery charge in case it's just obnoxiously large easily as big as 3 of the cases for the air pods granted the case is ready to offer enough charge for combined playtime of 24 hours another thing worth pointing out is that the earphones have an awkward way of sitting inside the case for the first few times checking the mount we were fumbling around trying to figure out how they fit the pairing process is similar to the inter pods you open up the case in your iphone detects them if you want to pair them to an Android phone they need to be placed in the case and put into pairing mode by pressing on the single button on the charging case now considering that there are physical buttons on each of the earphones it's rather inconvenient that the case is necessary to pair them like seriously why couldn't you just press the button that's on here to put them into pairing mode you know once connected there's nothing else that's needed to be done in fact there's no accompanying app to download just like the new air pods the beats power beats Pro aren't down with Apple's new h1 chip for unbreakable connection in our time using them there was not one instance when the connectivity ever broke up now the true test and setting apart the best of the best wireless earphones is how they handle streaming video Apple's new h1 chip shines in this area as well since powerbeats pro have zero noticeable latency voices aren't in perfect sync to what we're seeing on screen so you can enjoy watching all of your favorite content both their phones feature the same set of fiscal buttons on them the beats logo doubles as a multi-function button for pause play accept or decline phone call and it can even initiate your phones and voices in service with the long press double and triple presses performed track forward and reverse functions that are also fallen controls embedded into each earphone for quick adjustment on the fly so you don't have to rely on your smart phone no weighing beats his earphones reputation for being bass heavy you think that piece wouldn't deviate from the strategy while they do indeed offer an ample amount of bass it's not as heavy the bass is still there but nowhere to the same effect as the obnoxious bass heavy output of Beats as previous offerings instead the mids and the highs are still clearly distinguished without being overpowered by the lows the beats power beats Pro set a new benchmark when it comes to battery life among true wireless earphones previously it was the jabber lead 65 T that delivered an impressive six hours of usage but the power beats Pro goes the distance and much more that nearly nine hours with music playback add to that the extra 24 hours of combined playback that the battery case offers you can go on for days without ham to remember to charge them the beats power beats Pro make quite a splash into the true wireless space offering extended battery life and exceptionally tight fit and superb audio performance the only thing however that will stop most people in their tracks from picking them up is the price add $250 the beats power beats Pro aren't cheap at all so widespread adoption will be a challenge they're more expensive than other major options in the true wireless space including the air pods and the jabber elite 65 T in fact they actually would be competing against some of the ultra premium offerings like the sennheiser momentum true Wireless and banging offs and pure play eh wireless earphones while beetus earphones are worthy they lack some of the additional features we're getting with some of the competitors it suggests it's custom EQ settings noise cancellation or sound amplification despite that the power beats pro are worth a look if you're not after those a per mention features and simply want something with great sound quality and long-lasting battery and that is it for a review of the beats power beats Pro if you guys want to learn more about them you can check out our website phone ringing coms jahnvi signing off [Music] [Music]
