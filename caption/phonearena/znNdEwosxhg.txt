remember the greatest scandal in phone history $1,000 price tag of the iPhone 10 well we're way past that and what we told him 2017 to be the price ceiling of what people are prepared to pay turned out to be the floor this 2020 flagship phone season the iPhone 11 Pro Series start from $1,000 all the way up to nearly $1,500 for the iPhone 11 Pro max okay those greedy Apple honchos our favorite punching bag but take a look around even the lowly Galaxy S 20 starts from $1,000 now all the way up to nearly $1,600 for a half a gigabyte model of the galaxy s 20 Ultra what they offer more than the iPhone you say well how about their fellow Androids now Chinese phone companies previously associated with value for money propositions only are now offering more value for the money and encroaching on the apples and Samsung ters when it comes to pricing to the huawei p40 pro now starts from $1,000 for 128 gig model and the Oppo find x2 Pro is priced at $1300 just shy of the galaxy s 20 ultra HEC d1 plus CEO even had to assure us that the one plus a series pricing won't peers through the $1,000 barrier in the US which would still make these latest series the most expensive one post phones ever made well now falls in the US are following the trajectory of new cars they get stuffed with ever more complex technology and they get more expensive and visibly because something similar like this car loans and here we have phone installments with a plan in the four years up to last monthly car payment showed up $60 as opposed to just $5 in the previous four years digital for phone payments but since it's just a couple of bucks more per month really anybody noticed so what gives well even per Apple gone are the days when it made the iPhone 6 for $200 and sold it will triple that as the camera component was just $12 now the iPhone 11 promo cost about four hundred and ninety dollars to make and stars from eleven hundred dollars the most expensive iPhone 11 pro max component you ask well you guessed it it's not the screen anymore as usually before but the $74 triple camera kit the Hawaii CEO is on records confirming that a camera kit with periscope zoom like on the p40 Pro cost upwards of one hundred dollars in components alone which is a record but there is 5g to blame too according to un plus CEO Hydra connectivity poses many more design and technical configuration challenges compared to 4G especially in times when prices across the supply chain from raw materials to 5g chips are all rising generally and unlike the Snapdragon 805 5 that could be bought from Qualcomm as a standalone unit the new Snapdragon 865 chip that powers the flagship phones these days is only bundled with the 5g modem this requires retooling of the phone's insides and if you wanted those much touted 5g speeds you needed to additionally pay Qualcomm for adding millimeter wave filters and outfit the handset with a lot more antennas all around has millimeter waves like Verizon's 5g network cannot travel very far or even penetrate walls or you palm easily this if you want a cheaper phone this year you'd have to go with the likes of the Google pixel 5 or the LG G 9 that may land with the cheaper snapdragon 7 6 5 but of course those are just rumors yet when you say cheaper we don't mean just the chipset cost but the price for the whole processor graphics modem antennas kit which when coupled with Qualcomm's licensing fees in the internal design reinventions necessary could add up significantly to the final assembly cost of the phone snapdragon 765 a lower tier chip on the other hand is the only integrated shovel-ready 5g solution that can be used on US carriers so far apparently all of this snapdragon a six five paraphernalia does not only add to today's flagship phone costs but it also takes a heavier toll on battery compared to say the snapdragon seven six five chip according to phone maker Xiaomi haiji connectivity in general and snapdragon a 6'5 in particular each at 20% higher power draw from the battery forcing manufacturers to use much larger and more expensive battery packs then on their 4G 10 sets in short phone prices are rising again because nobody makes do with the front and rear camera anymore and some like the pho a p40 Pro are now up to 7 sensors in total add the expensive periscope zoom with folded lens optics the high refresh rate displays be 5g modem and the larger batteries to serve them all as well as the ultra fast charging blocks and high-end phone cost almost double in components compared to what they did just two or three years ago and there you have it folks when high-end phones cost $200 to make they sold for $600 now they cost $500 to manufacture and more in part prices alone and we seem to be creeping up towards $1500 flagships so when will it all end well expensive 5g and multi camera rockets will fall down and cost with time and we're keeping phones for three instead of two years now on average and this will cushion the price tags but the average high-end phone prices north of a grand are here to stay in this season of 10 times optical zoom 120 Hertz displays and all around 5g connectivity not to mention the bare necessities like the futuristic new in display finger scanners the question is who's buying in this guys wraps up our look at the reasons why smartphone prices keep on growing it here now reached almost the $1,500 mark I hope you enjoyed watching this video let me know your thoughts about these latest developments would you buy a $1500 phone or would you
