hey guys Nick with phone arena here and this is one of the worst phones of 2019 I mean look at it it has just two cameras it has this huge ugly bezel at the top and the 64 gigabytes of storage are just laughable but what if I told you that this is secretly what are the best phones that you have probably never used this is the Google pixel for Excel and I've been using it for several months already this phone is a perfect example of how a phones hardware specifications never paint a full picture and how real-world user experience is not something that you can express in numbers let's look at the display on paper you get the kind of specs every other high-end phone delivers six point three inches 1440p resolution AMOLED technology all that stuff but when you actually look at this display when you start using it you get you appreciate qualities that you will not find on a spec sheet colors for example look absolutely gorgeous they're bright and vivid but never over saturated the automatic brightness works flawlessly and I almost never have to touch it myself the edges of the glass are flat so you do not get any accidental touches like you would with other phones that have curved this place oh and did I mention the high refresh rate the pixel four has a 90 Hertz display which allows it to display motion that is smoother and more fluid it's a subtle difference that you cannot appreciate until you see it in person it is also one of the reasons why the pixel 4 feels so responsive but even without the refresh rate pixels remain among the fastest phones you can get I recently had to use the Galaxy Note 10 for a few hours and it felt slow in comparison even though its specs are nearly identical face recognition on the pixel 4 is a fantastic feature that works well even in absolute darkness it makes even the most advanced in screen fingerprint scanners look outdated the vibration mode is powerful and provides excellent feedback when you press a button on the virtual keyboard the new recorder app works like magic and I've been using it during presentations and interviews and the stereo speakers are among the best you will find on a phone today in fact we recently did a blind speaker test at the office and 11 out of 15 people chose the pixel for excel as their favorite over phones like the iPhone 11 pro or the Galaxy Note 10 the pixel for excel has its weak spots the camera setup for example should have had a third super wide angle lens now do not get me wrong it still takes great photos thanks to Google software HDR magic but a super wide angle camera is just not something that you can compensate for using algorithms another disappointment is the gesture system which Google implemented into the pixel 4 series it is the result of project soli which is something Google has been working on for years and it uses an actual Raider sensor to detect hand movements with unmatched precision so what can you actually do with it well you can skip a song by waving over the phone you can silence alarms or incoming phone calls with the same gesture or you can wave to Pikachu and he'll wave back really that's it that's all that you can do with project solid what's even worse is that these gestures do not work I force myself to use them even when I didn't need to and my success rate was about 20% now I suspect that something might be wrong with my phone my colleague Eugene has also been using a pixel for for probably several months and says that the gestures work almost every time for him but in any case I do not think that it matters the sad reality is that the pixel 4 would have been a better phone without project soli right now Google's radar chip does not solve any real problems and it must have been super expensive to develop I would gladly trade it for a super wide angle camera or an extra 64 gigabytes of storage by the way the storage options for the pixel or Excel are just bad I mean even my grandma knows what a gigabyte is and releasing high-end phone with just 64 gigs is embarrassing another weakness of the pixel four is its battery life on one hand it's probably good enough for most people on a normal day I go to bed with about 40 percent of battery left according to my battery stats I use the phone for about 3 to 4 hours every day for stuff like browsing the web watching video or streaming music on the other hand most high-end phones will last you longer the pixel for just doesn't seem to be very efficient with its power management looking at how it loses about 10 to 15 percent of battery overnight if I forget to charge it or at least there is how my unit has been behaving long story short this is not a phone for heavy users and you have to charge it religiously every night it's fun impressive battery life is the reason why I now have a simple wireless charger on my desk and I just leave my pixel to charge when I'm not using it so is the pixel for excel worth getting in 2020 especially now that the Samsung Galaxy S 20 is about to be released and the galaxy s 10 series is much cheaper to get I would say yes if the pixel 4 series was still priced as it was when it was released I would have told you to look elsewhere but right now a pixel for excel starts at $700 which in my opinion is a fair price just keep in mind that a pixel form is not a phone for everyone some people still think that pixels are for nerds and power users but I think it's the exact opposite therefore the average person could just want a reliable phone that works without overwhelming them with unnecessary features if you are a smartphone enthusiast or a heavy gamer chances are you would be much happier with something like the samsung galaxy s 20 eltra this was my quick review of the Google pixel for Excel after several months of use thank you for watching I hope it's been a helpful one and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel to never miss any of our future videos see you
