honor is technically an independent brand that sells falls at amazing prices but realistically it's an offshoot of Huawei so you should not be surprised than its new flagship the honor 20 Pro looks and feels a lot like a koala phone hello guys my name is Vic with fawn arena and I've been using the new honor 20 pro for the past couple of days and it's a phone with a stunning appearance and a brand new design styling that really catches the eye it also has a flagship processor all four cameras on its back and a large battery so should this be your next phone first the big news from these days though Google might strip huawei off its Android license if this indeed happens it means you'll not be getting any major future updates for Huawei and honor phones and this is a big deal it will be best to weigh it out to see how this develops before buying a phone from these companies especially if it costs a lot of money with this in mind the actual brand new honor 20 Pro here has got the looks it has a new design that honor calls holographic and it uses tiny prisms in the back to reflect light in stunning patterns we have never seen something quite like that before it really is a mesmerizing look and show just how far away and honor craftsmanship has gone all the buttons are on the right side within easy reach but what we find inconvenient is that the power key is recessed the fingerprint reader is actually embedded in it and it's extremely fast but it's again the sight position that is a bit annoying is you often get random vibrations when you're just fidgeting with the phone in your pocket looking at the front you get a six point twenty six inch LCD screen with a punch hall camera it doesn't quite have the vibrancy of AMOLED screens but it's one very good-looking LCD display just make sure to go into settings and change the display mode to natural while leaving color balance at the default setting it this mould colors are very well balanced and everything looks very pleasing and yes the bunch hallways here but it's really quite small and doesn't get much in the way one curious detail is that you have a couple of wallpapers by honor itself that play with that cutout and this is a nice little touch when it comes to the interface the phone runs on the company's custom magic UI on top of Android 9pi how magic UI is basically just a different theme of hallways emotion UI the two are extremely similar many apps actually look absolutely the same including the camera app and the dialer without the gesture navigation here it's so convenient that you can swipe from either side to go back a step under the hood the phone is powered by the current 980 chip and it has eight gigs of RAM again this chip is made by Huawei and it was the first seven nanometer one on Android but these days it ranks behind the Snapdragon 855 in terms of performance and it is far behind the FAA twelve Bionic chip on the latest iPhones still it feels very fast and fluid in daily operations navigating around the interface happens without a stutter and using this phone is just a breeze gamers would also be happy with the new graphene cooling sheet that dissipates heat better which helps the phone stay cooler while you play the most demanding games you also get a plentiful 256 gigs of on-board storage and you can expand that via the nano SD card standard now what about the cameras the big feature here is the world's largest aperture on a phone the main 48 megapixel camera uses an F 1.4 aperture while the closest competitors have only got F 1.6 so theoretically this should give honor a big advantage in low-light photography let's take a look at the photos and you can see that it does well but the quality is not quite as mind-blowing as you see on a Google pixel or who IP 30 Pro is there's a bit more noise and not quite that much detail the familiar from Huawei phones night mode is also here and it helps but it takes a really long while for each single photo and using this mode for more than a couple of snaps feels a bit tedious we also get a three times zoom telephoto lens and also have a 5 times zoom option with the help of the main camera zooming any further just uses digital zoom then you also have an ultra wide-angle camera which captures noticeably softer images and the quality is just not that great on it but we still appreciate having this different perspective there's also a fourth macro lens that captures falls in just the 2 megapixel resolution it is helpful though when you want to capture those close-ups from like an inch and a half from your subject last but not least you also get a 32 megapixel camera up front unfortunately you don't get HDR for the front camera and many of the selfies we took burn the highlights you are not as good as on other phones terms of videos the main camera can record 4k at 30 frames per second and you don't have a 60 FPS option quality is mostly ok but again not quite on par with the best video cameras now on the battery front the honor 20 Pro comes with a large 4,000 milliamp hour battery cell and in our experience it would easily last most users around the day and a half in even two days with lighter use the phone also ships with a fast charger in the box and you can top it up to 50% in just half an hour all in all the other 20 pro ends up being something like a cheaper version of Huawei's flagships it does not quite have the camera of the computer D pro nor the vibrant AMOLED screen and it lacks a few of the tricks like the in screen fingerprint scanner but it gets most things right the long battery life the good-looking LCD display the smooth performance and certainly the looks now if Google does indeed cut onerous access to Android cover this would be a big problem so our advice wait it out for a few months and only then consider buying this phone and this runs up our first look at the honor 20 pro thumbs up if you enjoyed this video subscribe for
